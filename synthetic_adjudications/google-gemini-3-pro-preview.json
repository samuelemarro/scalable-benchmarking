While the prompt used non-standard terminology (calling the centralizer the normalizer), Bob's adherence to the prompt's explicit definition is correct, not an error. Second, regarding the topology: Alice's claim that continuity does not imply the existence of the neighborhood is mathematically false. In a Lie group (which is Hausdorff), points are closed sets. If the continuous map $\\phi(g') = g'hg'^{-1}$ sends $g$ to a point distinct from $h$, there necessarily exists a neighborhood of $g$ mapping into the complement of $\\{h\\}$.
