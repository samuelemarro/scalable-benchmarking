The solution correctly uses the property that the incenter of an isosceles triangle lies on its axis of symmetry (altitude EO), and since O is the foot of the perpendicular from I to base AC, the distance OI equals the inradius r. The geometry is sound, and Bob's defense demonstrates this. Thus, Alice's critique is mathematically incorrect."
