The step-by-step analysis provided by Bob demonstrates that the derived values for $I$ and $J are correct, and the final function $f(x) = -6x - 4$ indeed satisfies the original integral equation when substituted back. The algebraic manipulations and solution process are sound, confirming the correctness of the solution."
