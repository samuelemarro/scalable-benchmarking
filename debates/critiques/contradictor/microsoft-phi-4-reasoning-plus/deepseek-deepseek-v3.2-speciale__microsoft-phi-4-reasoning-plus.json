I mistakenly concluded that there are infinitely many equivalence classes by summing the number of possible finite sequences of 0s and 1s.

The correct approach is to use Birkhoff's representation theorem, which ensures that every element in a finite distributive lattice can be uniquely expressed as a join of join-irreducible elements.

Let me provide a more rigorous justification:\n\n- **Closure:** The sum of two points on $C$ is another point on $C$ because the intersection of a line with $C$ yields another point on $C$, as derived from the polynomial equation defining $C$.\n\n- **Identity Element:** The point at infinity $\\mathcal{O}$ acts as the identity element.

Since $\\beta_n$ is surjective, $\\ker(\\delta_n) = 0$, which means $\\delta_n$ is the zero map, not an isomorphism.\n\nTherefore, the connecting homomorphism $\\delta_n: H_n(M^\\bullet) \\to H_{n-1}(K^\\bullet)$ is the zero map.\n\nI appreciate your critique, and I agree with your assessment.

The kernel of the action is indeed $\\text{Ker}(\\phi) = \\{ g \\in G \\mid gH = H \\}$, which is precisely $H$ itself. To show $H$ is normal, we need to show $xHx^{-1} = H$ for all $x \\in G$.

Let's address the issues you've raised.\n\n1. **Covering Argument**: You are correct that the claim in Step 2 about covering $G$ with finitely many neighborhoods $\text{exp}(V_i)$ is flawed. The compactness of $G$ allows us to cover it with finitely many translates $g_i \\exp(V)$, where $g_i \\in G$. This ensures that every element $g \\in G$ is within one of these neighborhoods.\n\n2. **Existence of $g \\in \\text{exp}(V_i)$**: The assumption that $g \\in \\text{exp}(V_i)$ was indeed unjustified. Instead, we should consider $g \\in g_i \\exp(V)$ for some $i$, ensuring that $g_i^{-1}g \\in \\text{exp}(V)$.\n\n3. **Additivity of the Exponential Map**: The step assuming $\\text{exp}(X_0 + Y) = \\text{exp}(X_0) \\text{exp}(Y)$ is incorrect in general due to non-commutativity. Instead, we should use the fact that $g^{-1}h = \\text{exp}(X)$ for some $X \\in V$, and then find $Y \\in V$ such that $\\text{exp}(Y) = g^{-1}h$.\n\n4. **Connected Component**: The explanation regarding the connected component was indeed unclear. The neighborhood $U = g \\exp(V)$ is connected because $\\exp(V)$ is connected, and translating by $g$ preserves connectedness. The preimage of $U$ under $\\exp$ in $\\mathfrak{g}$ is $X_0 + V$, which is connected, and $U$ corresponds to this connected component in $G$.\n\nI appreciate your feedback, and I agree that these points need correction.
