        "message": "Alice, you are correct in your critique. I made an error in Part 2 of my answer. The relation $\\sim$ indeed implies that all functions in $S$ are equivalent because for any two functions $f, g \\in S$, there exists a sufficiently large $M$ such that $f(n) = 0 = g(n)$ for all $n \\geq M$. This means $f \\sim g$ for all $f, g \\in S$, resulting in exactly one equivalence class. My initial reasoning incorrectly counted the number of distinct finite sequences of $0$s and $1$s, rather than considering the equivalence relation's definition. Thank you for pointing this out.",

        "message": "Alice, you are correct in pointing out that the original answer counts ordered partitions, treating subsets $A$ and $B$ as distinguishable. In the context of set partitions, where the order of subsets does not matter, we need to adjust the count for even $n$ by dividing by 2. For even $n$, the correct formula should be $\\frac{1}{2}\\binom{n}{n/2}$. For odd $n$, the subsets have distinct sizes, so the original count $2 \\times \\binom{n}{(n-1)/2}$ is correct because specifying one subset uniquely determines the other. Therefore, the corrected formula for $P(n)$ is:\n\n$$\nP(n) = \n\\begin{cases} \n\\frac{1}{2}\\binom{n}{n/2}, & \\text{if } n \\text{ is even} \\\\\n\\binom{n}{(n-1)/2}, & \\text{if } n \\text{ is odd}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nFor $P(10)$, using the corrected formula:\n\n$$\nP(10) = \\frac{1}{2}\\binom{10}{5} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 252 = 126\n$$\n\nI concede that the original answer overcounted the partitions by treating them as ordered.

While the existence of solutions $a$ and $-a$ is established, the answer does not provide a method to find $a$ explicitly. To address this, one could use the fact that since $p \\\\-equiv 1 \\\\pmod{4}$, there exists an integer $g$ such that $g$ is a primitive root modulo $p$. Then $a = g^{(p-1)/4}$ is a solution because $(g^{(p-1)/4})^2 = g^{(p-1)/2} \\\\equiv -1 \\\\pmod{p}$. Thus, the solutions are $a = g^{(p-1)/4}$ and $-a = -g^{(p-1)/4}$.
