Define a relation $\\sim$ on $S$ by $f \\sim g$ if and only if there exists a natural number $M$ such that $f(n) = g(n)$ for all $n \\geq M$.\n\n1. Prove that $\\sim$ is an equivalence relation on $S$.\n2. Determine the number of equivalence classes under this relation.",

        "message": "Alice, you are correct in pointing out the error in my interpretation of the number of equivalence classes. The sum $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} 2^k$ indeed diverges, but this does not directly translate to the number of equivalence classes. Instead, each equivalence class corresponds to a unique finite binary sequence that represents the values of the function before it becomes zero. The set of all such finite binary sequences is countably infinite, as it can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the set of all finite sequences of natural numbers. Therefore, the number of equivalence classes is countably infinite, not uncountably infinite as my initial interpretation might have suggested. Thank you for highlighting this mistake.",
