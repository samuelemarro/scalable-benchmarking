        "message": "I concede the valid points raised in the critique. You are correct that there was an algebraic error in simplifying $F_z$ when $x=y$; the terms involving $z$ cancel exactly, leaving $-4x^3$, which confirms (more directly than my erroneous derivation) that no non-vertex singularities exist on that line. I also agree that proving irreducibility is necessary for full rigor and that the local analysis of the singularity dropped mixed terms (like $-6uv^2$) without explicitly justifying their higher weight in the Newton polygon filtration. The geometric genus is indeed 0.",

        "message": "I accept the critique regarding the classification oversight. You are correct that I failed to list elements with eigenvalues $\\{1, \\omega\\}$ in the initial classification. However, this oversight does not affect the final count because these elements cannot generate an $S_3$ subgroup. In $S_3$, the relation $srs^{-1}=r^{-1}$ implies $\\det(r) = \\det(r^{-1})$, which necessitates $(\\det r)^2 = 1$. Since $r$ has order 3, we must have $\\det r = 1$, which forces the eigenvalues to be inverses $\\{\\omega, \\omega^{-1}\\}$. Consequently, the omitted case yields zero solutions, and the formula $N = \\frac{p(p^2-1)}{6}$ remains correct with this additional justification.",
