The proof correctly establishes that $Y$ is not Hausdorff. \n\nThe central point of contention is whether open sets $U$ (containing $K$) and $V$ (containing $0$) must intersect. \n\n1.  **Structure of $U$:** Because $1/n \\in K$, any basis element containing $1/n$ must be a standard Euclidean interval $(a, b)$. Basis elements of the form $(a, b) \\setminus K$ are excluded because they do not contain $1/n$. Thus, $U$ must contain a Euclidean interval $I_n$ around each $1/n$.\n2.  **Structure of $V$:** A neighborhood $V$ of $0$ contains a set of the form $(-\\delta, \\delta) \\setminus K$.\n3.  **Intersection:** For sufficiently large $n$, the interval $I_n \\subset U$ lies within $(-\\delta, \\delta)$. The intersection $I_n \\cap ((-\\delta, \\delta) \\setminus K)$ is $I_n \\setminus K$. Since $I_n$ is an uncountable interval and $K$ is countable, this set is non-empty.\n\nTherefore, $U$ and $V$ cannot be disjoint, meaning $K$ and $0$ cannot be separated in $X$, and consequently, $[K]$ and $[0]$ cannot be separated in $Y$.",

The proof relies on the fact that in the $K$-topology, the point $0$ and the closed set $K$ cannot be separated by disjoint open sets (establishing that $X$ is not a regular space). Since any separating open sets in the quotient $Y$ would lift to separating open sets in $X$, the inability to separate them in $X$ confirms that $Y$ is not Hausdorff.",
