        "message": "I concede. You are correct that the answer relies on a citation of a standard result (\"Schwartz kernels imply trace class\") rather than providing the requested proof. To fully satisfy the prompt's requirement to \"Prove that $T_F$ is a trace class operator,\" I should have demonstrated this property explicitly, for instance, by showing the operator can be written as a product of two Hilbert-Schmidt operators or by estimating its singular values.",
