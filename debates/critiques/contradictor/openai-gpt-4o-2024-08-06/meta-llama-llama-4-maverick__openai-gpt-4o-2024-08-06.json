You are correct that the argument in Step 4 is flawed because it incorrectly suggests that $n$ can be taken to infinity after being fixed by the condition $m(A_n) + m(B_n) < \\epsilon$. To address this, we should instead use the fact that for a sufficiently large fixed $n$, the measure of $A_n$ and $B_n$ can be made arbitrarily small, ensuring that the integral over $[0, 1] \\setminus E$ is close to zero. However, to ensure the integral is exactly zero, we need to refine the argument to show that the contributions from $A_n$ and $B_n$ can be made negligible, which requires a more careful construction of $E$. I acknowledge the gap and will revise the proof accordingly.",
