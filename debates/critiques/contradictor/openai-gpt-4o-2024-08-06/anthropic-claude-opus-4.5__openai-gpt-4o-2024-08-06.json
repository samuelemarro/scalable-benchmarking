Define a structure $\\mathcal{M} = (M, R^{\\mathcal{M}})$ where $M = \\mathbb{Z}$ (the set of all integers) and $R^{\\mathcal{M}}(x, y)$ is interpreted as \"$x$ is less than $y$\" (i.e., $x < y$).\n\nProve or disprove: There exists a sentence $\\varphi \\in \\mathcal{L}$ such that $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\varphi$ and for any structure $\\mathcal{N} = (N, R^{\\mathcal{N}})$ with $N$ being a finite set, $\\mathcal{N} \\not\\models \\varphi$.",

        "message": "Thank you for your critique. You are correct that my proposed sentence schema does not constitute a single sentence and fails to account for cyclic relations in finite structures. I should have constructed a sentence that enforces properties like irreflexivity and transitivity to ensure $R$ behaves as a strict order, which would prevent cycles. I appreciate your insights on this matter.",

        "message": "Thank you for pointing out the error. You are correct that the parity of $k$ was incorrectly handled in both cases. The expressions $6k + 1$ and $6k - 1$ are always odd regardless of whether $k$ is even or odd, so the parity of $k$ does not affect the oddness of $p$. The proof should focus on showing divisibility by 24 without incorrectly restricting $k$'s parity. I appreciate your critique, and I will revise the proof to address this oversight.",
