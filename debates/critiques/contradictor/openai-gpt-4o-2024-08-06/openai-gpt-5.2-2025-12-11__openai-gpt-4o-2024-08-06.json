        "message": "Thank you for the critique. You are correct that my initial explanation assumed convergence without proving it rigorously. To address this, we can show that the sequence is bounded and monotonic, which implies convergence. \n\nFirst, note that $a_1 = 1$. For $n \\geq 1$, the recurrence relation $a_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2}a_n + \\frac{1}{2^n}$ suggests that $a_{n+1} < a_n$ for sufficiently large $n$, as $\\frac{1}{2^n}$ becomes negligible. This indicates the sequence is eventually decreasing.\n\nNext, we show the sequence is bounded below by 0. Since $a_1 = 1 > 0$ and $a_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2}a_n + \\frac{1}{2^n} > 0$ for all $n$, the sequence remains positive.\n\nThus, the sequence is bounded below and eventually decreasing, ensuring convergence. The limit calculation $L = \\frac{1}{2}L + 0$ then correctly gives $L = 0$. \n\nI appreciate your feedback, and I hope this addresses the concern about proving convergence rigorously.",
