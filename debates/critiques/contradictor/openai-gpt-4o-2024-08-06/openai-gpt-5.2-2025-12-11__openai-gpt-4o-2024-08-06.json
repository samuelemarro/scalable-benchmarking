To address this, we can show that the sequence is bounded and monotonic, which implies convergence. \n\nFirst, note that $a_1 = 1$. For $n \\geq 1$, the recurrence relation $a_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2}a_n + \\frac{1}{2^n}$ suggests that $a_{n+1} < a_n$ for sufficiently large $n$, as $\\frac{1}{2^n}$ becomes negligible. This indicates the sequence is eventually decreasing.\n\nNext, we show the sequence is bounded below by 0. Since $a_1 = 1 > 0$ and $a_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2}a_n + \\frac{1}{2^n} > 0$ for all $n$, the sequence remains positive.\n\nThus, the sequence is bounded below and eventually decreasing, ensuring convergence.

You are correct in pointing out the errors in my reasoning. \n\n1) I incorrectly stated that $T$ is an orthogonal projection without verifying that $T$ is self-adjoint. Idempotence alone does not imply orthogonality.\n\n2) I also mistakenly claimed that the closure of $\\operatorname{Ran}(T)$ is compact due to $T$ being compact. This was incorrect, as compactness of $T$ only ensures that the image of the unit ball is relatively compact, not the closure of the range.\n\n3) Your suggested approach using the compactness of $T$ and the properties of idempotence to show that $\\operatorname{Ran}(T)$ must be finite-dimensional is indeed the correct method.\n\nI appreciate your detailed feedback and acknowledge the errors in my original answer.",

The labeling is part of the problem's input, and reordering affects the diagonals and their weights.\n\n2. **Incorrect Ceiling Calculation**: I made an error in calculating the ceiling for $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$. The correct value should indeed be $k$, not $k+1$.\n\n3. **Existence of Non-Adjacent Pairs**: I failed to justify the existence of a non-adjacent pair from sets $A$ and $C$ without assuming a sorted order.\n\nI appreciate your feedback and will revise the proof to address these issues.",
