To address this, we can show that the sequence is bounded and monotonic. \n\nFirst, note that the sequence is bounded below by 0 since $a_1 = 1$ and each term $a_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2}a_n + \\frac{1}{2^n}$ is positive. \n\nNext, we show the sequence is decreasing for sufficiently large $n$. Consider the difference $a_{n+1} - a_n = -\\frac{1}{2}a_n + \\frac{1}{2^n}$. For $n \\geq 2$, $\\frac{1}{2^n} < \\frac{1}{2}$, so $a_{n+1} < a_n$ if $a_n > 0$.
