    "question": "Consider the formal language of first-order logic with equality, containing a single binary relation symbol $R$. Let $\\mathcal{L}$ be the set of all sentences in this language. Define a structure $\\mathcal{M} = (M, R^{\\mathcal{M}})$ where $M = \\mathbb{Z}$ (the set of all integers) and $R^{\\mathcal{M}}(x, y)$ is interpreted as \"$x$ is less than $y$\" (i.e., $x < y$).\n\nProve or disprove: There exists a sentence $\\varphi \\in \\mathcal{L}$ such that $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\varphi$ and for any structure $\\mathcal{N} = (N, R^{\\mathcal{N}})$ with $N$ being a finite set, $\\mathcal{N} \\not\\models \\varphi$.",

You are correct that the sentence I proposed was not properly specified as a single sentence and could indeed be true in some finite structures, as you pointed out. The argument about infinite sequences was not applicable to the sentence as written. I concede that the proof is invalid as it stands.",
