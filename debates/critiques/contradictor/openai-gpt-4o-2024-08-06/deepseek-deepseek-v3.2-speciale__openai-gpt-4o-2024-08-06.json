Define a structure $\\mathcal{M} = (M, R^{\\mathcal{M}})$ where $M = \\mathbb{Z}$ (the set of all integers) and $R^{\\mathcal{M}}(x, y)$ is interpreted as \"$x$ is less than $y$\" (i.e., $x < y$).\n\nProve or disprove: There exists a sentence $\\varphi \\in \\mathcal{L}$ such that $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\varphi$ and for any structure $\\mathcal{N} = (N, R^{\\mathcal{N}})$ with $N$ being a finite set, $\\mathcal{N} \\not\\models \\varphi$.",

You are correct that the sentence I proposed was not properly specified as a single sentence and could indeed be true in some finite structures, as you pointed out. The argument about infinite sequences was not applicable to the sentence as written. I concede that the proof is invalid as it stands.",

For any integer $k$, $6k + 1$ and $6k - 1$ are always odd, so the divisibility argument should not rely on the parity of $k$. However, the conclusion that $p^2 - 1$ is divisible by 24 remains valid because $p^2 - 1 = 12k(3k \\pm 1)$ is divisible by 24 regardless of $k$'s parity, as $12k$ is always divisible by 12 and $3k \\pm 1$ ensures divisibility by 2. I appreciate your critique, and I will ensure to correct the reasoning in future explanations.",
