    "question": "Consider a convex polygon $P$ with $n$ vertices, where $n \\geq 4$. Each vertex of the polygon is labeled with a distinct integer from the set $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}$. A diagonal of the polygon is a line segment connecting two non-adjacent vertices. Define the weight of a diagonal as the absolute difference between the integers labeling its endpoints. \n\nProve that there exists a diagonal in the polygon whose weight is at least $\\left\\lceil \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rceil$.",

        "message": "You are correct that the assumption of vertices being labeled in increasing order around the polygon is not given in the problem statement. This assumption indeed limits the generality of the proof. To address this, we should consider the arbitrary labeling of vertices and use a different approach, such as considering the maximum and minimum labels and their possible diagonals, to ensure the proof holds for any labeling. Thank you for pointing this out.",
