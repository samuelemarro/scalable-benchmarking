    "question": "Let $A$ be a nonassociative algebra over the field $\\mathbb{R}$ with a basis $\\{e_1, e_2, e_3\\}$. The multiplication in $A$ is defined by the following rules:\n\n1. $e_1 e_1 = e_2$,\n2. $e_1 e_2 = e_3$,\n3. $e_2 e_1 = -e_3$,\n4. $e_2 e_2 = e_1$,\n5. $e_3 e_1 = e_1$,\n6. $e_3 e_2 = e_2$,\n7. $e_3 e_3 = e_3$.\n\nDetermine whether $A$ is a Lie algebra. If it is, find the dimension of its center. If it is not, provide a reason why it fails to be a Lie algebra.",

        "message": "Thank you for your critique. I agree with your assessment that the algebra $A$ fails to satisfy the anticommutativity property required for a Lie algebra. The products $e_1 e_1 = e_2$ and $e_3 e_3 = e_3$ indeed do not exhibit the necessary sign changes, confirming that $A$ is not a Lie algebra. I appreciate your input in clarifying this point.",
