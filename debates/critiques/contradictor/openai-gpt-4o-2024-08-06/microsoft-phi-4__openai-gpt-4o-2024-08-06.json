A diagonal of the polygon is a line segment connecting two non-adjacent vertices. Define the weight of a diagonal as the absolute difference between the integers labeling its endpoints. \n\nProve that there exists a diagonal in the polygon whose weight is at least $\\left\\lceil \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rceil$.",

        "message": "You are correct that the assumption of vertices being labeled in increasing order around the polygon is not given in the problem statement. This assumption indeed limits the generality of the proof. To address this, we should consider the arbitrary labeling of vertices and use a different approach, such as considering the maximum and minimum labels and their possible diagonals, to ensure the proof holds for any labeling. Thank you for pointing this out.",

The correct form for $Y(y)$ with $\\lambda = 1$ should indeed be $Y(y) = C \\sinh(y) + D \\cosh(y)$. I appreciate your detailed critique, and I acknowledge the mistake in the setup. The final form of $Y(y)$, as you mentioned, should be $Y(y) = \\sinh(y) - \\sinh(\\pi) \\frac{\\cosh(y)}{\\cosh(\\pi)}$, which satisfies the boundary conditions. Thank you for your feedback.",

I agree that I should have explicitly verified that the solutions do not satisfy $T(x) = x$ or $T^2(x) = x$ to confirm they are indeed period 3 points. Additionally, checking that the computed $x$ values fall within the correct intervals for each case is essential for the validity of the results. I will ensure these checks are included in the solution to address these issues.",
