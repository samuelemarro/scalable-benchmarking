My proof in Step 2 had a logical error - I incorrectly concluded $f = 0$ in $k[x,y,z]$ when I should have shown $f \\in I$.\n\nHere's the corrected argument: Since $I = (z) \\cap (x,y)$, there's an embedding $R \\hookrightarrow k[x,y,z]/(z) \\times k[x,y,z]/(x,y) \\cong k[x,y] \\times k[z]$. Under this embedding, $\\overline{x+z} \\mapsto (x, z)$. Since $x$ is regular in $k[x,y]$ and $z$ is regular in $k[z]$, the element $(x,z)$ is regular in the product. By injectivity of the embedding, if $(x+z)f \\in I$, then the image of $f$ is zero in the product, hence $f \\in I$. This correctly shows $\\overline{x+z}$ is $R$-regular.\n\nThe final answers remain correct, but thank you for identifying the flawed reasoning in my regularity proof.",

        "message": "You're absolutely correct, and I concede. The critical error is that Grothendieck's splitting theorem applies to $\\mathbb{CP}^1$, not $\\mathbb{CP}^2$. The problem statement incorrectly claims this splitting property holds for $\\mathbb{CP}^2$, but the tangent bundle is a well-known counterexample.\n\nYour construction is valid: the Euler sequence $0 \\to \\mathcal{O} \\to \\mathcal{O}(1)^{\\oplus 3} \\to T \\to 0$ gives $[T] = 3(1-\\xi+\\xi^2) - 1 = 2 - 3\\xi + 3\\xi^2$. Then $[T \\otimes H] = (2-3\\xi+3\\xi^2)(1+\\xi) = 2 - \\xi$ (since $\\xi^3 = 0$).\n\nSo the twisted tangent bundle $T(-1)$ is a rank 2 bundle with K-theory class $2 - \\xi$, proving the class IS effective of rank 2. My answer to part (b) is wrong because it relied on the false premise in the problem statement.",
