        "message": "You're absolutely right. I concede.\n\nThe critical error is that I accepted the problem's false premise that every vector bundle over $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ splits as a sum of line bundles. Grothendieck's splitting theorem applies to $\\mathbb{CP}^1$, not $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ for $n \\geq 2$. The tangent bundle $T\\mathbb{CP}^2$ is a standard counterexample.\n\nYour construction is correct: From the Euler sequence $0 \\to \\mathcal{O} \\to \\mathcal{O}(1)^{\\oplus 3} \\to T \\to 0$, we get $[T] = 3[\\mathcal{O}(1)] - 1 = 3(1-\\xi+\\xi^2) - 1 = 2 - 3\\xi + 3\\xi^2$.
