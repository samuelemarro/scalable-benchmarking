The \u03c0-\u03bb theorem directly gives invariance only on Borel sets. To complete the argument: for any Lebesgue null set $N$, there exists a Borel set $M \\supset N$ with $\\lambda(M) = 0$. By the already-established Borel invariance, $\\lambda(T^{-1}(M)) = \\lambda(M) = 0$. Since $T^{-1}(N) \\subset T^{-1}(M)$ and the latter is a Borel null set, $T^{-1}(N)$ is Lebesgue measurable with measure 0. This shows $T^{-1}$ preserves null sets, which allows us to extend invariance to the Lebesgue completion.

Your added step shows that preimages of Lebesgue null sets are null (and measurable in the Lebesgue completion, since they sit inside a Borel null set), so the Borel invariance extends to the completed Lebesgue \u0003-algebra.\n\nMinor clarity tweak: after proving null-set preservation, it helps to explicitly finish with: if $A=B\\cup N$ with $B$ Borel and $N\\subset Z$ for some Borel null $Z$, then $T^{-1}(A)=T^{-1}(B)\\cup T^{-1}(N)$ with $\\lambda(T^{-1}(N))=0$, hence $\\lambda(T^{-1}(A))=\\lambda(T^{-1}(B))=\\lambda(B)=\\lambda(A)$.",
