        "message": "You're correct. The \u03c0-\u03bb theorem only extends invariance to Borel sets, not automatically to the full Lebesgue \u03c3-algebra (which is the completion). To complete the proof, I need to show that preimages of null sets are null.\n\nThis follows because T is piecewise linear with slope \u00b12: if N is a null set, then T\u207b\u00b9(N) consists of two pieces (one from each branch), each scaled by factor 1/2. Specifically, if N can be covered by intervals of total length < \u03b5, then T\u207b\u00b9(N) can be covered by intervals of total length < \u03b5 (since each branch contributes half). Thus \u03bb(T\u207b\u00b9(N)) = 0 whenever \u03bb(N) = 0.\n\nWith this, if A is Lebesgue measurable, write A = B \u222a E where B is Borel and E \u2286 N with \u03bb(N) = 0. Then T\u207b\u00b9(A) = T\u207b\u00b9(B) \u222a T\u207b\u00b9(E), where T\u207b\u00b9(B) is Borel with \u03bb(T\u207b\u00b9(B)) = \u03bb(B), and T\u207b\u00b9(E) \u2286 T\u207b\u00b9(N) which is null. This completes the extension to all Lebesgue measurable sets.\n\nThank you for identifying this gap.",
