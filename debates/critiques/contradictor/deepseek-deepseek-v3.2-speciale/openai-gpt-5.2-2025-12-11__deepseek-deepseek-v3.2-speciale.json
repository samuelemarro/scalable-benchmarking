    "question": "Let $B = \\{ z \\in \\mathbb{C}^n \\mid \\|z\\| < 1 \\}$ be the unit ball in $\\mathbb{C}^n$ ($n \\ge 1$), where $\\|z\\|^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^n |z_i|^2$. Suppose $f: B \\to B$ is a biholomorphism (i.e., $f$ is holomorphic, bijective, and its inverse $f^{-1}$ is also holomorphic) such that $f(0) = 0$. Prove that $f$ is a linear unitary transformation; that is, there exists an $n \\times n$ unitary matrix $U$ such that $f(z) = U z$ for all $z \\in B$.",

        "message": "You are correct. The step invoking the maximum principle directly on the norm of a vector-valued holomorphic function is not justified without additional reasoning (e.g., using subharmonicity or reducing to scalar functions via linear functionals). This is a substantive gap in the proof. I concede that the answer as written is insufficient. The rest of the argument is standard, but the missing justification invalidates the solution's rigor.",
