The correct method involves recognizing that Y can only take values of the form e^k for integer k, corresponding to the values of X in the Poisson distribution. Therefore, the correct probability mass function is P(Y = e^k) = P(X = k) = e^{-3} * 3^k / k! for k = 0, 1, 2, ...",

Your revised explanation correctly identifies that Y can only take values of the form $e^k$ for integer $k$, corresponding to the values of X in the Poisson distribution.

Your revised approach correctly addresses the issue by decomposing the integrand using polynomial long division, which is appropriate given the degree of the numerator is higher than that of the denominator.
