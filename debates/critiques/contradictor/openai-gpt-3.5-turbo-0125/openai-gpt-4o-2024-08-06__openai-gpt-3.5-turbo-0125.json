In the context of self-adjoint operators, the spectral theorem establishes a direct link between the spectrum of $T$ and the support of the projection-valued measure $E$. Specifically, for a self-adjoint operator $T$, the spectrum $\text{spec}(T)$ coincides with the essential range of $E$. This connection ensures that every eigenvalue of $T$ is associated with a projection in $E$ that captures its essential behavior. Therefore, the spectral properties of $T$ inherently dictate its essential range through the spectral resolution provided by $E$.",
