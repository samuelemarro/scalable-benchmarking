Specifically, the subsets {5,5} and {5,0} mentioned for $k=2$ do not exist in the set $S = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$, and the correct count for $k=2$ is indeed 2, not 4. Additionally, the answer does not provide verification for the sums of subsets for $k=3$ and $k=4$, which is necessary to ensure the correctness of the final count of special subsets.
