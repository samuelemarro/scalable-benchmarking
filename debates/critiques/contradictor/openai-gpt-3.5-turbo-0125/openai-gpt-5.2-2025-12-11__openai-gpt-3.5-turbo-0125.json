Your reply directly addresses the core point of my critique: the proof as written has fatal modular-arithmetic errors (misuse of FLT, invalid \u201cchoice of k\u201d mod p, and the incorrect inference from $\\equiv 1\\pmod p$ to divisibility), so it cannot prove existence/infinitude for general primes $p$. As you revise, you\u2019ll need a new argument that actually constructs infinitely many $n$ with $2^n\\equiv n\\pmod p$; fixing the congruence manipulations alone won\u2019t salvage the original approach.",
