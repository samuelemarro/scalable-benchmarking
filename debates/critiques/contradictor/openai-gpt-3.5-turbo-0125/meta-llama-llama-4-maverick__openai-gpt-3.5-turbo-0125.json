To verify this, we need to check if the correct application of these principles leads to $DE = \\\\sqrt{71}$. Let's examine the steps: The Angle Bisector Theorem gives $BD/DC = AB/AC = 13/15$, and with $BC = 14$, we can solve for $BD$ and $DC$. The incenter's tangency point $E$ on $BC$ can be found using the formula $BE = (AB + BC - AC)/2 = 6$. Thus, $DE = |BD - BE|$.
