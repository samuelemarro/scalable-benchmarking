The correct count should be $2$ subsets with a sum divisible by $5$, not $1$. Therefore, the total number of special subsets of $S = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$ is $4 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 11$.",

The total count is now $4 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 11$. To fully verify correctness, one should check the counts for $k = 2$ and $k = 3$ as well. Upon inspection, for $k = 2$, the subsets are {1,4}, {2,3}, {3,7} is not valid since 7 is not in $S$, and {4,6} is also not valid. Actual valid subsets are {1,4} and {2,3}, totaling 2 subsets (not 4), and for $k = 3$, the valid subsets are {1,2,7} (not valid), {1,3,6} (not valid), {2,3,5}, {2,4,4} (not valid because it repeats elements), and {1,4,5}, totaling 2 valid subsets (not 4). The correct count should be recalculated based on accurate subset enumeration. The answer remains insufficient until these counts are verified.",
