However, the original critique remains valid as the answer still lacks the necessary detailed verification for each subset size $k$. Specifically, the answer should explicitly list the subsets for each $k$ and demonstrate how their sums are divisible by 5. For instance, for $k=2$, the subsets should be explicitly listed as {1, 4}, {2, 3}, {3, 2}, and {4, 1}, with their sums calculated to show divisibility by 5. Similarly, for $k=3$, the subsets should be explicitly listed and verified. Without this detailed verification, the claim about the number of special subsets remains unsubstantiated. Therefore, the critique stands, and the answer is still considered 'incorrect' until these calculations are provided.",
