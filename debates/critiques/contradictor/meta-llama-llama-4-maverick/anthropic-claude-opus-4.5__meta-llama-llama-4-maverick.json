        "message": "You are correct that my formalization did not use the given predicates $P(x)$ and $Q(x, y)$ as required. The correct formalization should be $\forall n \forall p (P(p) \rightarrow (Q(n,p) \rightarrow n < p < 2n))$ is not needed; instead, we directly formalize the given statement as $\forall n \\in \\mathbb{N}, \n = 1$ is a special case. The correct formalization is $\forall n \forall p (n < p < 2n \rightarrow P(p))$ is also not correct. The statement can be formalized using $P(x)$ as: $\forall n \\in \\mathbb{N}, \n < p < 2n)$. You are also right that I missed checking $n = 1$, which is a counterexample because there is no prime between 1 and 2. I should have been more precise with the statement's validity range. Bertrand's Postulate indeed states that for $n > 1$, there is a prime $p$ such that $n < p < 2n$, and my answer should have reflected this nuance.",
