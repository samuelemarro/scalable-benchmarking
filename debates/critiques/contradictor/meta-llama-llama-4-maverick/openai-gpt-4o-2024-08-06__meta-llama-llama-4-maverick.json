The formalization is: \u2200n \u2208 \u2115, \u2203p (P(p) \u2227 n < p < 2n). For the proof, I will reference the established result that Bertrand's Postulate is true, proven by Chebyshev and later simplified by Ramanujan and Erd\u0151s. A detailed proof can be found in number theory texts or references like Hardy and Wright's 'An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers'.",
