It encompasses topics such as permutations, combinations, graph theory, and more.\n\n## Step 3: Generate a problem\nTo create a challenging problem, let's consider a topic within Combinatorics that is both interesting and requires substantial reasoning. A potential topic is graph theory, specifically focusing on graph coloring or connectivity.\n\n## Step 4: Formulate the problem\nLet's formulate a problem: \"Prove that in any simple graph with $n$ vertices, if the graph is connected and has no cycles (i.e., it's a tree), then it has exactly $n-1$ edges.\"\n\n## Step 5: Verify the problem against the quality rubric\n- **Well-Posedness and Completeness**: The problem is self-contained, defines the necessary terms (simple graph, connected, no cycles, tree), and asks for a proof.\n- **Clarity**: The terms used are standard in graph theory, and the task is clear.\n- **Non-Triviality**: The problem requires understanding of graph theory and a proof involving induction or another suitable method, making it non-trivial.\n- **Solvability and Verification**: The statement is a known fact in graph theory and can be proven using established methods.\n\n## Step 6: Provide the solution\nTo solve this, we can use induction on $n$. For $n=1$, a tree has 0 edges, and $1-1=0$, so the statement holds. For $n>1$, assume the statement is true for all trees with fewer than $n$ vertices. A tree with $n$ vertices has at least one leaf (a vertex of degree 1); removing this leaf and its edge gives a tree with $n-1$ vertices. By the induction hypothesis, this smaller tree has $(n-1)-1 = n-2$ edges. Adding back the removed edge gives $n-2 + 1 = n-1$ edges, proving the statement for $n$.\n\n## Step 7: Format the output\nLet's format the problem and solution according to the required structure.\n\n\nLet $G$ be a simple graph with $n$ vertices.

A challenging problem could involve proving a property related to prime numbers or solving a specific type of Diophantine equation.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a problem that meets the criteria.\nLet's consider a problem involving the sum of divisors of a number and its relation to perfect numbers. A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors, excluding the number itself.\n\n## Step 4: Specify the problem.\nConsider the following problem: \"Prove that if $n$ is an even perfect number, then $n = 2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$, where $2^p - 1$ is a Mersenne prime.\"\n\n## Step 5: Provide the solution to the problem.\nTo solve this, we need to understand the definition of an even perfect number and its relation to Mersenne primes.\n\n## Step 6: Recall the definition and properties of even perfect numbers.\nAn even perfect number $n$ can be written as $n = 2^{k-1}(2^k - 1)$, where $2^k - 1$ is prime. This is known as the Euclid-Euler theorem.\n\n## Step 7: State the Euclid-Euler theorem.\nThe Euclid-Euler theorem states that every even perfect number is of the form $2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$, where $2^p - 1$ is a Mersenne prime (i.e., $2^p - 1$ is prime).\n\n## Step 8: Provide the proof or reasoning for the given statement.\nThe proof involves two main parts: (1) showing that any number of the form $2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$, where $2^p - 1$ is prime, is perfect, and (2) showing that every even perfect number is of this form.\n\n## Step 9: Outline the proof that $2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$ is perfect when $2^p - 1$ is prime.\nLet $n = 2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$. The sum of divisors of $n$, $\\sigma(n)$, is given by $\\sigma(n) = \\sigma(2^{p-1})\\sigma(2^p - 1)$. Since $2^p - 1$ is prime, $\\sigma(2^p - 1) = 2^p$. Also, $\\sigma(2^{p-1}) = 1 + 2 + 2^2 + \\cdots + 2^{p-1} = 2^p - 1$. Thus, $\\sigma(n) = (2^p - 1) \\cdot 2^p = 2 \\cdot 2^{p-1}(2^p - 1) = 2n$, proving $n$ is perfect.\n\n## Step 10: Outline the proof that every even perfect number is of the form $2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$.\nLet $n$ be an even perfect number. Then $n = 2^k \\cdot m$, where $m$ is odd. Since $n$ is perfect, $\\sigma(n) = 2n$. Using the multiplicative property of $\\sigma$, we have $\\sigma(n) = \\sigma(2^k)\\sigma(m) = (2^{k+1} - 1)\\sigma(m)$. Thus, $(2^{k+1} - 1)\\sigma(m) = 2^{k+1}m$. This implies $2^{k+1} - 1$ divides $m$, so $m = (2^{k+1} - 1)d$ for some $d$. Substituting back gives $\\sigma(m) = 2^{k+1}d$. For $d = 1$, $m = 2^{k+1} - 1$ is prime, and $\\sigma(m) = m + 1 = 2^{k+1}$, which matches our requirement. For $d > 1$, it leads to a contradiction because $\\sigma(m) \\geq m + d > 2d$, unless $d = 1$ and $m$ is prime.\n\n## Step 11: Conclude the solution.\nThe given statement is a direct consequence of the Euclid-Euler theorem, which characterizes even perfect numbers.\n\nThe final answer is: \n\nProve that if $n$ is an even perfect number, then $n = 2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$, where $2^p - 1$ is a Mersenne prime.",

The problem should be well-posed, clear, non-trivial, and solvable with established mathematical methods.\n\n## Step 2: Identify a suitable topic within algebraic geometry\nAlgebraic geometry is a broad field that involves the study of geometric objects, such as varieties and schemes, using tools from abstract algebra. A suitable topic could involve the study of curves, surfaces, or higher-dimensional varieties, and their properties.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a specific problem\nLet's consider a problem involving the intersection of curves on a surface. A classic result in algebraic geometry is B\u00e9zout's theorem, which describes the intersection of two curves on a projective plane. We can formulate a problem related to this.\n\n## Step 4: State the problem\nConsider two curves $C_1$ and $C_2$ on $\\mathbb{P}^2$, defined by homogeneous polynomials $f(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 - z^2$ and $g(x,y,z) = xy - z^2$, respectively. Find the number of intersection points of $C_1$ and $C_2$ in $\\mathbb{P}^2$, counted with multiplicity.\n\n## Step 5: Provide the solution\nTo find the intersection points, we need to solve the system of equations given by $f(x,y,z) = 0$ and $g(x,y,z) = 0$. This means we have to solve $x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = 0$ and $xy - z^2 = 0$ simultaneously.\n\n## Step 6: Solve the system of equations\nFirst, from $xy - z^2 = 0$, we can express $z^2 = xy$. Substituting $z^2$ into the first equation gives $x^2 + y^2 - xy = 0$. This is a homogeneous equation in $x$ and $y$, which can be solved by considering it as a quadratic form.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze the quadratic form\nThe equation $x^2 - xy + y^2 = 0$ can be analyzed by finding its roots. This is equivalent to solving $x^2 - xy + y^2 = 0$ for $x$ in terms of $y$ (or vice versa), treating it as a quadratic equation.\n\n## Step 8: Solve for $x$ in terms of $y$\nUsing the quadratic formula, $x = \\frac{y \\pm \\sqrt{y^2 - 4y^2}}{2} = \\frac{y \\pm \\sqrt{-3y^2}}{2}$. For $y \\neq 0$, this simplifies to $x = \\frac{y(1 \\pm i\\sqrt{3})}{2}$. Thus, $x = y\\omega$ or $x = y\\omega^2$, where $\\omega$ is a primitive third root of unity.\n\n## Step 9: Determine the intersection points\nFor $x = y\\omega$ and $x = y\\omega^2$, substituting back into $xy = z^2$ gives $y^2\\omega = z^2$ and $y^2\\omega^2 = z^2$, respectively. This implies $z = \\pm y\\sqrt{\\omega}$ and $z = \\pm y\\sqrt{\\omega^2}$. However, we must consider the projective nature and the fact that we're working with homogeneous coordinates.\n\n## Step 10: Count the intersection points with multiplicity\nSince $\\omega$ and $\\omega^2$ are not real, and we're working over $\\mathbb{C}$, we need to consider the solutions in $\\mathbb{P}^2(\\mathbb{C})$. The solutions are given by the pairs $(x:y:z)$ satisfying both equations. We need to check if there are any solutions where $y = 0$, which would imply $x = 0$ and thus $z = 0$, but $(0,0,0)$ is not a valid point in $\\mathbb{P}^2$.\n\n## Step 11: Apply B\u00e9zout's theorem for a simpler solution\nB\u00e9zout's theorem states that two curves of degrees $d_1$ and $d_2$ intersect in $d_1d_2$ points, counted with multiplicity, if they have no common components. Here, $C_1$ and $C_2$ are both of degree 2, so they should intersect in $2 \\times 2 = 4$ points.\n\nThe final answer is: \n\nConsider two curves $C_1$ and $C_2$ on $\\mathbb{P}^2$, defined by homogeneous polynomials $f(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 - z^2$ and $g(x,y,z) = xy - z^2$, respectively.

    "question": "## Step 1: Understand the task and the requirements for the problem.\nThe task is to generate a challenging but solvable mathematics problem in the domain of real functions, along with a complete and verifiable solution. The problem must be well-posed, clear, non-trivial, and solvable with established mathematical methods.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the specific area within real functions to focus on.\nGiven the broad domain of real functions, we can consider various aspects such as differentiation, integration, functional equations, or properties of specific types of functions (e.g., continuous, differentiable, integrable).\n\n## Step 3: Choose a specific topic within real functions that can be used to create a challenging problem.\nLet's consider the topic of functional equations, which involves finding a function that satisfies a given equation involving the function and its inputs.\n\n## Step 4: Generate a challenging problem in the chosen topic.\nConsider the functional equation $f(x + y) = \\frac{f(x) + f(y)}{1 - f(x)f(y)}$ for $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$, where $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$. The task is to find all $f$ that satisfy this equation.\n\n## Step 5: Ensure the problem is well-posed and meets the quality rubric.\nThe given functional equation is well-defined, and the task is clear. We need to verify that it's non-trivial and solvable.\n\n## Step 6: Provide a solution to the generated problem.\nTo solve $f(x + y) = \\frac{f(x) + f(y)}{1 - f(x)f(y)}$, let's first check if there are any obvious solutions. For $y = 0$, we get $f(x) = \\frac{f(x) + f(0)}{1 - f(x)f(0)}$. This simplifies to $f(x)(1 - f(x)f(0)) = f(x) + f(0)$, or $f(x) - f(x)^2f(0) = f(x) + f(0)$, leading to $-f(x)^2f(0) = f(0)$. If $f(0) \\neq 0$, this gives $f(x)^2 = -1$ for all $x$, which is impossible for real-valued $f$. Thus, $f(0) = 0$.\n\n## Step 7: Continue solving the functional equation.\nSetting $y = x$, we have $f(2x) = \\frac{2f(x)}{1 - f(x)^2}$. This is a useful relation but let's first explore the derivative of $f$ if it exists. Assuming $f$ is differentiable, differentiating both sides with respect to $y$ and then setting $y = 0$ gives $f'(x) = \\frac{f'(0)(1 + f(x)^2)}{(1 - f(x)f(0))^2} = f'(0)(1 + f(x)^2)$ because $f(0) = 0$. So, $f'(x) = f'(0)(1 + f(x)^2)$.\n\n## Step 8: Solve the differential equation obtained from the functional equation.\nThe differential equation $f'(x) = f'(0)(1 + f(x)^2)$ can be solved by separation of variables: $\\frac{df}{1 + f^2} = f'(0)dx$. Integrating both sides gives $\\arctan(f(x)) = f'(0)x + C$, where $C$ is a constant. Since $f(0) = 0$, we have $C = 0$. Thus, $f(x) = \\tan(f'(0)x)$.\n\n## Step 9: Verify that the solution satisfies the original functional equation.\nSubstituting $f(x) = \\tan(f'(0)x)$ into the original equation: $\\tan(f'(0)(x+y)) = \\frac{\\tan(f'(0)x) + \\tan(f'(0)y)}{1 - \\tan(f'(0)x)\\tan(f'(0)y)}$, which is a known trigonometric identity, thus verifying that $f(x) = \\tan(f'(0)x)$ is a solution.\n\n## Step 10: Check if there are any constraints on $f'(0)$.\nFor $f(x) = \\tan(f'(0)x)$ to be defined for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $f'(0)$ must be $0$, otherwise, $f(x)$ will have discontinuities. If $f'(0) = 0$, then $f(x) = 0$ for all $x$, which is indeed a solution.\n\n## Step 11: Formulate the final problem and solution.\nLet's formulate the problem: \"Find all $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy $f(x + y) = \\frac{f(x) + f(y)}{1 - f(x)f(y)}$ for all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\"\n\n\nFind all $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy $f(x + y) = \\frac{f(x) + f(y)}{1 - f(x)f(y)}$ for all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.",

    "question": "## Step 1: Understand the task and the domain\nThe task is to generate a challenging but solvable mathematics problem in the domain of Potential theory, along with a complete and verifiable solution. Potential theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of potentials and their properties, particularly in relation to partial differential equations, especially Laplace's equation.\n\n## Step 2: Identify key concepts in Potential theory\nPotential theory involves the study of harmonic functions, potentials (such as Newtonian or logarithmic potentials), and their applications. Key concepts include the Laplace equation ($\\Delta u = 0$), Poisson's equation ($\\Delta u = f$), and boundary value problems (Dirichlet and Neumann problems).\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a problem\nTo create a challenging problem, we need to involve some of the advanced concepts or techniques from Potential theory. Let's consider a problem involving the Dirichlet problem for the Laplace equation on a specific domain.\n\n## Step 4: Specify the problem\nLet's consider the following problem: \"Let $D = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2: |x| < 1\\}$ be the unit disk in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Find the solution $u(x)$ to the Dirichlet problem $\\Delta u = 0$ in $D$, $u(x) = \\log|x - (1,0)|$ on $\\partial D$.\"\n\n## Step 5: Provide the solution\nTo solve this problem, we can use the Poisson integral formula, which gives the solution to the Dirichlet problem on the unit disk. The Poisson integral formula is given by $u(x) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{\\partial D} \\frac{1 - |x|^2}{|x - y|^2} f(y) ds(y)$, where $f(y)$ is the boundary data.\n\n## Step 6: Apply the Poisson integral formula\nFor $x = (r\\cos\\theta, r\\sin\\theta)$ and $y = (\\cos\\phi, \\sin\\phi)$, we have $|x - y|^2 = r^2 - 2r\\cos(\\theta - \\phi) + 1$ and $ds(y) = d\\phi$. The boundary data is $f(y) = \\log|y - (1,0)| = \\log\\sqrt{2 - 2\\cos\\phi}$. So, $u(x) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{1 - r^2}{r^2 - 2r\\cos(\\theta - \\phi) + 1} \\log\\sqrt{2 - 2\\cos\\phi} d\\phi$.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the integral\nThe integral can be simplified by recognizing that $\\log\\sqrt{2 - 2\\cos\\phi} = \\log|1 - e^{i\\phi}| = \\log|1 - e^{i\\phi}| = \\Re(\\log(1 - e^{i\\phi}))$. However, directly evaluating this integral is complex and typically involves recognizing it as a special case that can be related to the properties of harmonic functions and the Poisson kernel.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluate the solution using properties of harmonic functions\nFor $x \\in D$, the solution can be found by directly applying properties of harmonic functions and recognizing that the given boundary condition corresponds to a specific harmonic function. The function $u(x) = \\log|x - (1,0)|$ is harmonic in $D$ except at $x = (1,0)$, which is outside $D$ since $|1,0| = 1$ is on $\\partial D$. Thus, we directly check if $u(x)$ satisfies the given boundary condition and is harmonic.\n\n## Step 9: Check if the given boundary data directly provides the solution\nSince $\\log|x - (1,0)|$ is harmonic in $D$ and equals $\\log|y - (1,0)|$ on $\\partial D$, it is the solution to the Dirichlet problem.\n\nThe final answer is: \n\nLet $D = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2: |x| < 1\\}$ be the unit disk in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Find the solution $u(x)$ to the Dirichlet problem $\\Delta u = 0$ in $D$, $u(x) = \\log|x - (1,0)|$ on $\\partial D$.",

The problem should be well-posed, clear, non-trivial, and solvable with established mathematical methods.\n\n## Step 2: Identify key concepts in the domain\nSeveral complex variables and analytic spaces involve the study of functions of multiple complex variables and the spaces on which these functions are defined. Key concepts include holomorphic functions, complex manifolds, analytic continuation, and various types of domains (e.g., domains of holomorphy, pseudoconvex domains).\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a problem\nTo create a problem, we need to focus on a specific aspect of several complex variables. Let's consider the concept of holomorphic functions on a domain in $\\mathbb{C}^n$. A potential problem could involve characterizing or analyzing the properties of such functions.\n\n## Step 4: Specify the problem\nLet's formulate a problem related to the extension of holomorphic functions. A well-known result in several complex variables is the Hartogs' extension theorem, which states that any holomorphic function defined on a domain in $\\mathbb{C}^n$ ($n > 1$) with a compact hole can be extended holomorphically to the whole domain. We can create a problem related to this concept.\n\n## Step 5: Create the problem statement\nConsider the domain $\\Omega = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}^2 : |z_1| < 1, |z_2| < 1\\}$ and the subset $S = \\{z \\in \\Omega : |z_1| < \\frac{1}{2}\\}$. Let $f$ be a holomorphic function on $\\Omega \\setminus S$. Show that $f$ can be extended to a holomorphic function on $\\Omega$.\n\n## Step 6: Provide the solution\nTo solve this, we recognize that $\\Omega \\setminus S$ is not a compact hole in $\\Omega$, so we cannot directly apply Hartogs' theorem. However, we can analyze the problem by considering the properties of holomorphic functions in $\\mathbb{C}^2$ and the specific geometry of $\\Omega$ and $S$.\n\n## Step 7: Detail the solution\nFor $z = (z_1, z_2) \\in \\Omega \\setminus S$, $f(z)$ is holomorphic. We need to show that $f$ can be extended holomorphically to $\\Omega$. For any fixed $z_2$ with $|z_2| < 1$, $f(z_1, z_2)$ is holomorphic in $z_1$ for $\\frac{1}{2} \\leq |z_1| < 1$. By the principle of analytic continuation in one variable, if $f(z_1, z_2)$ is holomorphic for $|z_1| < 1$ except on a smaller disk, it can be extended. However, the direct application of Hartogs' theorem is not possible here due to the shape of $S$. Instead, we can use the fact that for each $z_2$, $f(\\cdot, z_2)$ can be extended to $|z_1| < 1$ because the singularity set is contained within $|z_1| \\leq \\frac{1}{2}$, and then apply Hartogs' theorem or a similar principle to conclude the extension is holomorphic in both variables.\n\n## Step 8: Write the problem and solution in the required format\n\nLet $\\Omega = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}^2 : |z_1| < 1, |z_2| < 1\\}$ and $S = \\{z \\in \\Omega : |z_1| < \\frac{1}{2}\\}$. Suppose $f$ is a holomorphic function on $\\Omega \\setminus S$. Prove that $f$ can be extended to a holomorphic function on $\\Omega$.",

The problem should be well-posed, clear, non-trivial, and solvable with established mathematical methods.\n\n## Step 2: Identify a suitable topic within Convex and discrete geometry\nConvex and discrete geometry encompasses a broad range of topics including the geometry of convex sets, polytopes, and discrete geometric structures. A suitable topic could involve properties of convex polytopes, such as their faces, volumes, or the relationships between their vertices and facets.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a specific problem\nLet's consider a problem related to the properties of a specific convex polytope. A well-known result in convex geometry is the characterization of regular polytopes. However, a more challenging and less straightforward problem could involve understanding the relationship between the number of vertices, edges, and faces of a polytope.\n\n## Step 4: Generate a problem statement\nConsider a 3-dimensional convex polytope $P$ that is simple (every vertex is incident to exactly 3 edges) and has $V$ vertices, $E$ edges, and $F$ faces. The problem is to prove that for such a polytope, Euler's formula ($V - E + F = 2$) holds, and then use this to derive a relationship between $V$ and $F$.\n\n## Step 5: Write down the problem in the required format\n\nLet $P$ be a simple 3-dimensional convex polytope with $V$ vertices, $E$ edges, and $F$ faces. Prove that $V - E + F = 2$ and derive a formula relating $V$ and $F$ using the fact that $P$ is simple.",
