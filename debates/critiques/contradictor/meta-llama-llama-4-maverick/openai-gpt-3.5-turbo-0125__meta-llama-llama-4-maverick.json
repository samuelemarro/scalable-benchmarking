To directly establish compactness, consider that $T$ maps $L^2[0,1]$ into $H^1[0,1]$, which is compactly embedded in $L^2[0,1]$ by Rellich-Kondrachov theorem. Thus, $T$ is compact because it maps bounded sets in $L^2$ to relatively compact sets in $L^2$.",

The map $F(\\iota): \\mathbb{Q}/\\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Q}/\\mathbb{Z}$ is given by $x \\mapsto nx$, but more accurately, it should be understood as $1 \\otimes x \\mapsto n \\otimes x = 1 \\otimes nx$. This map is indeed not injective as I initially stated, but for a different reason. However, the correct analysis shows that the map is actually multiplication by $n$, which is not injective because it annihilates elements of order $n$.
