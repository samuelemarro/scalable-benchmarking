The conversion of $\\tfrac{1}{10}$ to fiftieths should indeed be $\\tfrac{5}{50}$, not $\\tfrac{10}{50}$. This correction leads to the correct calculation of $\\pi^{(2)}_C = \\tfrac{6}{25}$ and $\\pi^{(3)}_C = \\tfrac{31}{125}$. Therefore, the original critique's claim of an incorrect calculation is unfounded. I concede that the original answer's calculations are correct.",
