    "question": "Let $\\mathcal{H}$ be a separable Hilbert space, and let $T: \\mathcal{H} \\to \\mathcal{H}$ be a compact, self-adjoint operator. Consider the spectral decomposition of $T$ given by $T = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\lambda_n \\langle \\cdot, e_n \\rangle e_n$, where $\\{e_n\\}$ is an orthonormal basis of $\\mathcal{H}$ consisting of eigenvectors of $T$, and $\\{\\lambda_n\\}$ are the corresponding eigenvalues.\n\n1. Prove that the sequence $\\{\\lambda_n\\}$ converges to zero.\n2. Determine the conditions under which the series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} |\\lambda_n|^2$ converges.\n3. Explain the significance of this convergence in the context of the operator $T$.",

        "message": "The final answer '$\boxed{0}$' was a misinterpretation of the format required for the multi-part question. The proof that $\\{\\lambda_n\\}$ converges to zero is correct. For the series $\\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty} |\\\\lambda_n|^2$, it's acknowledged that $T$ being Hilbert-Schmidt is equivalent to its convergence. The significance of this convergence was explained as $T$ having a finite Hilbert-Schmidt norm, providing additional structure. I will ensure the response format matches the question's requirements in the future.",
