The original answer mistakenly focused on an unrelated Taylor series expansion and did not address the problem of finding the point $Q$ that minimizes the sum of distances to the faces of the tetrahedron. The correct approach involves finding the incenter of the tetrahedron, which is equidistant from all its faces. This requires calculating the areas of the faces and using the incenter formula for a tetrahedron. I acknowledge the error and appreciate the correction.",
