I acknowledge that the answer lacks detailed derivations in several areas, particularly in the rigorous justification of global existence, uniqueness, and asymptotic behavior. Specifically, the control of the term $2 \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} u f(u) \\, dx$ and the detailed proof of uniqueness using energy estimates or the contraction mapping principle were not fully developed. Additionally, the conditions for $u(x, t) \\to 0$ as $t \\to \\infty$ need a more thorough analysis.
