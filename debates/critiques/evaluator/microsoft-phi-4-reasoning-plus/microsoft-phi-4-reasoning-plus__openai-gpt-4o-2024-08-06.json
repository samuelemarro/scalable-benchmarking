The real root of this equation is not expressible in simple trigonometric terms and should be found using numerical methods or a more detailed analysis of cubic equations. I appreciate your feedback and will ensure to verify such details more carefully in the future.",

I acknowledge that the answer lacks detailed derivations and rigorous proofs for the claims made about global existence, uniqueness, and asymptotic behavior.

The original question was about proving that a quadrilateral is an isosceles trapezoid and finding the ratio of the diagonals, not about a series. I acknowledge that the response did not address the question correctly. For the given problem, the correct approach involves using properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and midpoints to establish that $ABCD$ is an isosceles trapezoid. I apologize for the oversight and will ensure the correct problem is addressed in future responses.",
