This is achieved by considering $U = \\exp(V)$ where $V$ is a neighborhood of some $X \\in \\mathfrak{g}$ with $\\exp(X) = g$, and $\\exp|_V$ is a diffeomorphism, thus ensuring local uniqueness within $V$. The choice of $U$ as a connected component of the preimage under the exponential map ensures uniqueness within that component.",
