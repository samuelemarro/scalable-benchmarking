It holds for specific cases (like cyclotomic polynomials) but fails for others (like $x^4-2$). I have corrected the solution to provide the proofs for Parts 1 and 2, and to explicitly disprove the statement in Part 3 with a counterexample.\n\n### Part 1: Prove that $[K : F] = 4$\n\n**Proof:**\nLet $f(x) = x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \\in F[x]$. We are given that $f(x)$ is irreducible over $F$ and $\\alpha$ is a root in an extension $E$. Since $f(x)$ is monic and irreducible, it is the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $F$. \n\nThe degree of the field extension $K = F(\\alpha)$ over $F$ is equal to the degree of the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$:\n$$ [K : F] = [F(\\alpha) : F] = \\\\deg(f(x)) = 4 $$\n\\\\hfill $\\\\square$\n\n### Part 2: Determine the minimal polynomial of $\\\\alpha^2$ over $F$\n\nLet $\\\\gamma = \\\\alpha^2$. We seek the minimal polynomial $g(y) \\\\in F[y]$.\n\n**1. Derivation of a polynomial satisfied by $\\\\gamma$**\nFrom $f(\\\\alpha) = 0$, we have $\\\\alpha^4 + b\\\\alpha^2 + d = -\\\\alpha(a\\\\alpha^2 + c)$. Squaring both sides yields:\n$$ (\\\\alpha^4 + b\\\\alpha^2 + d)^2 = \\\\alpha^2(a\\\\alpha^2 + c)^2 $$\nSubstituting $\\\\gamma = \\\\alpha^2$:\n$$ (\\\\gamma^2 + b\\\\gamma + d)^2 = \\\\gamma(a\\\\gamma + c)^2 $$\nExpanding $P(y) = (y^2 + by + d)^2 - y(ay + c)^2$:\n$$ P(y) = y^4 + (2b - a^2)y^3 + (b^2 + 2d - 2ac)y^2 + (2bd - c^2)y + d^2 $$\n$P(y)$ is a monic polynomial of degree 4 satisfying $P(\\\\gamma) = 0$.\n\n**2. Identifying the Minimal Polynomial**\nThe degree of the minimal polynomial of $\\\\gamma$, denoted $g(y)$, is $m = [F(\\\\gamma):F]$. We know $F \\\\subseteq F(\\\\gamma) \\\\subseteq F(\\\\alpha)$. Thus $m$ divides $[F(\\\\alpha):F]=4$.\n\n*   **Case $m=1$:** Impossible, as $\\\\gamma \\\\in F \\\\implies \\\\alpha$ satisfies $x^2 - \\\\gamma = 0$, contradicting $\\\\deg(f)=4$.\n*   **Case $m=2$:** This implies $g(y)$ is quadratic and $P(y) = g(y)^2$. This happens if and only if $f(x)$ is biquadratic ($a=0, c=0$). If $a=0, c=0$, $f(x) = x^4+bx^2+d$, so $\\\\gamma$ satisfies $y^2+by+d=0$, which is irreducible since $f$ is.\n*   **Case $m=4$:** Generally ($a \\\\neq 0$ or $c \\\\neq 0$), $[F(\\\\gamma):F]=4$. Since $P(y)$ is monic, degree 4, and $P(\\\\gamma)=0$, $g(y) = P(y)$.\n\n**Result:**\nIf $a=0$ and $c=0$, $g(y) = y^2 + by + d$.\nOtherwise, $g(y) = y^4 + (2b - a^2)y^3 + (b^2 + 2d - 2ac)y^2 + (2bd - c^2)y + d^2$.\n\n### Part 3: Analysis of Root Relationships\n\n**Claim:** If $\\\\beta$ is another root of $f(x)$, then $\\\\beta \\\\in \\\\{\\\\alpha, \\\\alpha^2, \\\\alpha^3, \\\\alpha^4\\\\}$.\n\n**Refutation:**\nThe claim is **false** for a general irreducible polynomial.\n\n**Counterexample:** Let $F=\\\\mathbb{Q}$ and $f(x) = x^4 - 2$. This is irreducible by Eisenstein's criterion ($p=2$).\nLet $\\\\alpha = \\\\sqrt[4]{2} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}$. The powers are $S = \\\\{2^{1/4}, 2^{1/2}, 2^{3/4}, 2\\\\}$, all of which are positive real numbers.\nHowever, $\\\\beta = -\\\\sqrt[4]{2}$ is another root of $f(x)$. Since $\\\\beta < 0$, $\\\\beta \\\\notin S$. Thus, the root $\\\\beta$ cannot be expressed as a positive integer power of $\\\\alpha$.",
