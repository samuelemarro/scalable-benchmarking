Converting to common denominator 57 gives (18/57, 22/57, 17/57) which sums to 57/57 = 1, satisfying normalization. So part (a) is correct. For part (b), v^(2)_3 = 8/25 = 32/100, so using 32/100 is fine. The calculation yields 36/125, which is correct. Thus the answer is correct, and the critique's claims are unfounded.",

        "message": "Bob's response addresses the critique by showing that the stationary distribution does indeed sum to 1 when expressed with a common denominator, confirming the normalization condition is satisfied. This resolves the issue raised in part (a). For part (b), Bob clarifies that using 32/100 is equivalent to 8/25, which is correct, and the final calculation of 36/125 is verified as accurate. Therefore, the original critique's claims about incorrect calculations in both parts are unfounded. The answer is correct.",
