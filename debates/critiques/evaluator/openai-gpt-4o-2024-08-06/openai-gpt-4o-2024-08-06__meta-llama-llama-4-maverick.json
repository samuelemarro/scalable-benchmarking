To complete the proof, I should have shown that having 8 Sylow 7-subgroups leads to a contradiction with the existence of Sylow 2-subgroups. Specifically, if $n_7 = 8$, the 8 elements not of order 7 must form a Sylow 2-subgroup. This implies $n_2 = 1$, which is a valid scenario and doesn't directly lead to a contradiction. However, the key insight is that if $n_7 = 8$, it doesn't directly contradict the Sylow theorems for $p=2$. The correct approach should involve showing that a group of order 56 must have a normal subgroup of order 7 by either directly proving $n_7 = 1$ or using additional group theory properties.
