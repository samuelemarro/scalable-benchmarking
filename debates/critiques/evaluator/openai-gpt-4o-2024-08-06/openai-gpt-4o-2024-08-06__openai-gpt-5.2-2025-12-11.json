Hence $\\pi_1=\\frac{6}{19}$, $\\pi_2=\\frac{22}{57}$, $\\pi_3=\\frac{17}{57}$, which sum to 1.\n\n**(b)** The stated $P^2$ is correct (e.g. $(P^2)_{2,1}=\\frac{1}{10}\\cdot\\frac12+\\frac35\\cdot\\frac{1}{10}+\\frac{3}{10}\\cdot\\frac25=\\frac{23}{100}$, etc.), so $(P^3)_{2,1}=\\left(\\frac{23}{100},\\frac{9}{20},\\frac{8}{25}\\right)\\cdot\\left(\\frac12,\\frac{1}{10},\\frac25\\right)=\\frac{36}{125}$ is also correct.",

        "message": "Bob, I appreciate your response, but there are still issues that need to be addressed:\n\n**(a)** The normalization step you provided is incorrect. The sum $1 + \\frac{11}{9} + \\frac{17}{18}$ should be calculated as $1 + \\frac{22}{18} + \\frac{17}{18} = \\frac{57}{18}$, which indeed simplifies to $\\frac{19}{6}$, not $1$. Therefore, the normalization of the stationary distribution is incorrect, as the components should sum to 1.\n\n**(b)** Regarding the calculation of $P^2$, the specific entry $(P^2)_{2,1}$ you calculated as $\\frac{23}{100}$ is correct, but the subsequent calculation of $(P^3)_{2,1}$ needs to be verified with the correct $P^2$. The calculation of $(P^3)_{2,1}$ as $\\frac{36}{125}$ should be checked again to ensure it follows from the correct $P^2$ matrix.\n\nThe critique stands as the normalization error in part (a) affects the stationary distribution, and the verification of the matrix multiplication in part (b) is necessary to ensure accuracy.",

        "message": "(a) You\u2019re right that the coefficient sums to $\\frac{57}{18}=\\frac{19}{6}$, but that\u2019s exactly why we then set $(\\frac{19}{6})\\pi_1=1$ and get $\\pi_1=\\frac{6}{19}$. With that, $\\pi=(\\frac{6}{19},\\frac{22}{57},\\frac{17}{57})=(\\frac{18}{57},\\frac{22}{57},\\frac{17}{57})$, which indeed sums to 1.\n\n(b) Using the stated $P^2$, $(P^3)_{2,1}=(0.23,0.45,0.32)\\cdot(0.5,0.1,0.4)=0.115+0.045+0.128=0.288=\\frac{36}{125}$. So the $(P^3)_{2,1}$ computation is consistent with the correct $P^2$.",

        "message": "In part (a), I acknowledge that the normalization step was indeed corrected by setting $(\\frac{19}{6})\\pi_1 = 1$, leading to the correct value of $\\pi_1 = \\frac{6}{19}$. The stationary distribution $\\pi = (\\frac{18}{57}, \\frac{22}{57}, \\frac{17}{57})$ does sum to 1, addressing my initial concern. \n\nIn part (b), the calculation of $(P^3)_{2,1}$ using the correct $P^2$ was shown to be consistent, with the result $0.288 = \\frac{36}{125}$. This resolves the issue I raised about the computation of $P^2$ and its impact on $(P^3)_{2,1)$. \n\nThank you for the clarifications. The solution is now correct.",
