So $\\pi=(\\frac{18}{57},\\frac{22}{57},\\frac{17}{57})$ is consistent with what I wrote, and it satisfies $\\pi P=\\pi$.\n\n(b) The $P^2$ entries I listed are correct (e.g. $(P^2)_{2,\\cdot}=(0.23,0.45,0.32)$). Then\n$$(P^3)_{2,1}=(0.23,0.45,0.32)\\cdot(0.5,0.1,0.4)=0.115+0.045+0.128=0.288=\\frac{36}{125},$$\nso the final probability is correct.

The minor LaTeX formatting issue does not affect the mathematical correctness. \n\nI concede that my initial critique misidentified these errors.",
