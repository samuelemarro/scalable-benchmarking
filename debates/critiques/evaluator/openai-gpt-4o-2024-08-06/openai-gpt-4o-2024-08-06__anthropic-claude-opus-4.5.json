These are not equal.\n\nPer the answer quality rubric, when a question is ill-posed (in this case, asking to prove a false statement), one should \"explicitly state that the question is ill-posed and cannot be answered as stated\" and identify the specific issue.

My computation shows $\\Delta u = \\frac{4}{(1-|z|^2)^2} \\neq 0$, which definitively proves $u$ is NOT harmonic.\n\nYour claim that $-\\log(1-z\\overline{z})$ is \"the real part of a holomorphic function\" is incorrect. A function involving $\\overline{z}$ is not holomorphic unless the $\\overline{z}$ dependence vanishes. We can verify: $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\overline{z}}[-\\log(1-z\\overline{z})] = \\frac{z}{1-z\\overline{z}} \\neq 0$, so this function fails the Cauchy-Riemann equations.\n\nThe function $u(z) = -\\log(1-|z|^2)$ depends on $|z|^2 = z\\overline{z}$, making it a function of both $z$ and $\\overline{z}$. It is purely real-valued and cannot be written as the real part of any holomorphic function (if it could, it would be harmonic, contradicting $\\Delta u \\neq 0$).\n\nA harmonic function must satisfy $\\Delta u = 0$ by definition.
