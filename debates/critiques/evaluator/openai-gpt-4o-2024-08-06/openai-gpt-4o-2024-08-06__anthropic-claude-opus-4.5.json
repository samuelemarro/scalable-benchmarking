My Laplacian calculation is correct AND my conclusion is correct.\n\nAlice claims $u$ is \"the real part of a holomorphic function, specifically $-\\log(1-z\\overline{z})$.\" This is mathematically incorrect. The expression $-\\log(1-z\\overline{z})$ is **not** a holomorphic function because it depends on $\\overline{z}$. Holomorphic functions cannot depend on $\\overline{z}$ in a non-trivial way.\n\nThe function $|z|^2 = z\\overline{z}$ is not holomorphic\u2014it fails the Cauchy-Riemann equations. Therefore $u(z) = -\\log(1-|z|^2)$ cannot be the real part of any holomorphic function.\n\nTo verify: if $u$ were harmonic, it would have a harmonic conjugate $v$ satisfying Cauchy-Riemann. But the mixed partials don't match, confirming no such $v$ exists.\n\nMy calculation shows $\\Delta u = \\frac{4}{(1-|z|^2)^2} > 0$, which is definitively nonzero throughout $D$. The function is **subharmonic**, not harmonic.\n\nAlice may be confusing this with $-\\log|1-z|$, which IS harmonic (real part of $-\\log(1-z)$). But $-\\log(1-|z|^2)$ is fundamentally different.",

        "message": "Thank you for your response, Bob. I acknowledge your point regarding the holomorphic nature of the function. You are correct that $u(z) = -\\log(1-|z|^2)$ cannot be the real part of a holomorphic function because it depends on $\\overline{z}$, and holomorphic functions cannot depend on $\\overline{z}$ in a non-trivial way. I also agree that $|z|^2 = z\\overline{z}$ is not holomorphic, and thus $u(z)$ cannot be harmonic. Your calculation of the Laplacian, $\\Delta u = \\frac{4}{(1-|z|^2)^2}$, is correct and shows that $u$ is subharmonic, not harmonic. I concede that my initial critique was incorrect regarding the harmonic nature of $u$. Thank you for clarifying this.",

These are not equal.\n\nAccording to the answer quality rubric, when a question asks to prove something false, I should \"explicitly state that the question is ill-posed and cannot be answered as stated.\" That's exactly what I did.\n\nMoreover, I did address the original product identity by providing its corrected form:\n$$\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\Gamma\\left(n + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{(2n-1)!! \\cdot \\pi}{2^n}$$\n\nThis is the same structure as the original (product of both Gamma functions), just with the correct right-hand side (\u03c0 instead of \u221a\u03c0). The proof I provided for \u0393(n+1/2) = (2n-1)!!\u221a\u03c0/2^n immediately yields this corrected product when multiplied by \u0393(1/2) = \u221a\u03c0.\n\nWhat would you have me do instead\u2014provide a \"proof\" of a false statement?",

According to the answer quality rubric, identifying an ill-posed question and explaining why it cannot be answered as stated is indeed appropriate.

Given these points, I agree that your approach was justified and consistent with the rubric's guidance for handling ill-posed questions.
