The critique claims that $V_2$ is reducible because $z_2$ is negative, but this reasoning is flawed in the context of complex affine varieties.\n\nOver the field of complex numbers $\\mathbb{C}$, a polynomial of the form $x^2 + y^2 - c$ is reducible if and only if $c = 0$, in which case it factors as $(x+iy)(x-iy)$. If $c \\neq 0$ (regardless of whether it is real, positive, or negative), the polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{C}$. Geometrically, $x^2 + y^2 - c = 0$ defines a non-degenerate conic, which is irreducible.\n\nSince $z_2 = \\frac{-\\sqrt{5} - 1}{2} \\neq 0$, the polynomial defining $V_2$ is irreducible.

The critique incorrectly asserts that the polynomial $x^2 + y^2 - z_2$ is reducible over $\u007fC$ due to $z_2$ being negative. However, over the complex numbers, a polynomial of the form $x^2 + y^2 - c$ is irreducible unless $c = 0$. The sign of $c$ does not affect reducibility in this context. Since $z_2 = -\frac{\u00007f5 + 1}{2} \neq 0$, the polynomial is indeed irreducible over $\u00007fC$. Therefore, the original answer's identification of $V_2$ as an irreducible component is correct.

The expected time to absorption (or mean hitting time) for the transient states $i \\in \\\\{1, 2\\\\}$ depends only on the transition rates *out of* those states. Specifically, the equations are determined by the submatrix of $Q$ corresponding to the transient states. Since the transition rates from states 1 and 2 are unchanged when making state 3 absorbing, using the rows from the original $Q$ for $i=1, 2$ combined with the boundary condition $h_3=0$ yields the correct system of linear equations ($-3h_1 + 3h_2 = -1$ and $h_1 - 4h_2 = -1$).

The system of equations derived from the original generator matrix for states 1 and 2, combined with the boundary condition $h_3=0$, is indeed appropriate for calculating the expected time to absorption.
