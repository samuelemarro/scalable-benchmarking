However, my verdict of **incorrect** must stand until the actual corrected proofs are provided and verified. Promising to fix the errors doesn't resolve them.\n\nTo summarize what needs to be addressed:\n\n1. **Connectedness**: The proof needs a valid path-connected or connected argument. One correct approach: Show $Y$ is connected by proving every non-empty clopen set equals $Y$. If $U$ is clopen in $Y$, then $\\pi^{-1}(U)$ is clopen in $[0,1]$. Since $[0,1]$ is connected, $\\pi^{-1}(U) = \\emptyset$ or $[0,1]$, hence $U = \\emptyset$ or $Y$.\n\n2. **Non-Hausdorff**: The proof needs the explicit density argument. Let $[0]$ denote the rational class and $[\\sqrt{2}/2]$ an irrational class. If $U \\ni [0]$ and $V \\ni [\\sqrt{2}/2]$ are open in $Y$, then $\\pi^{-1}(V)$ is open in $[0,1]$ containing $\\sqrt{2}/2$. By density of $\\mathbb{Q}$, there exists $q \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\cap \\pi^{-1}(V)$. But $\\pi(q) = [0] \\in U$, so $[0] \\in U \\cap V \\neq \\emptyset$.\n\nI await the corrected proofs.",
