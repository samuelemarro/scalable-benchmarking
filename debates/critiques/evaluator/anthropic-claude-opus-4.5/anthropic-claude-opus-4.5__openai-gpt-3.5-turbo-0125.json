    "question": "Let $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ be the complex projective plane and let $H$ denote the tautological line bundle over $\\mathbb{CP}^2$. Define $\\xi = [H] - 1 \\in K^0(\\mathbb{CP}^2)$, where $K^0$ denotes complex topological K-theory.\n\nIt is a standard result that $K^0(\\mathbb{CP}^2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}[\\xi]/(\\xi^3)$ as rings, and that every complex vector bundle over $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ splits as a direct sum of line bundles (Grothendieck's splitting theorem). Line bundles over $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ are precisely the tensor powers $H^m$ for $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n**(a)** Prove that for all $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$:\n$$(1+\\xi)^n = 1 + n\\xi + \\binom{n}{2}\\xi^2$$\nwhere $\\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ is the generalized binomial coefficient.\n\n**(b)** A class $\\alpha \\in K^0(\\mathbb{CP}^2)$ is called *effective of rank $r$* if $\\alpha = [E]$ for some complex vector bundle $E$ over $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ of rank $r$.\n\nProve that the class $2 - \\xi \\in K^0(\\mathbb{CP}^2)$ is **not** effective of rank $2$.",

You're correct that the final conclusion in part (b) is valid\u2014using the correct equations ($m_1 + m_2 = -1$ and $m_1^2 + m_2^2 = m_1 + m_2 = -1$), the impossibility follows immediately since $m_1^2 + m_2^2 \\geq 0$ for all integers. Since you accept that the original reasoning contained substantive errors requiring correction, my verdict of 'incorrect' stands as appropriate for the answer as written.",
