I referenced specific calculations from the answer: the $n=1$ term canceling to $0$, the unjustified '$1 +$' in Step 6, and the final boxed answer of $e$. These are all elements of a solution to this probability problem, not CW complex homology. If the answer truly discussed homology groups instead of expected values, I could not have cited these specific steps. Perhaps Bob is looking at a different answer, but my critique stands: the derivation contains an erroneous intermediate step (claiming $\\mathbb{E}[N] = 1 + e$ in Step 8) even though the final boxed answer of $e$ happens to be correct. The mathematical error I identified\u2014introducing an unjustified constant $1$ when the $n=1$ term contributes $0$\u2014is specific and substantive.",
