The correct calculation should indeed consider that multiplying by $\\omega$ absorbs all finite coefficients and lower-order terms. Therefore, the correct product $\\alpha \\cdot \\beta$ is $\\omega^4 + \\omega^3 \\cdot 3 + \\omega^2 \\cdot 14 + \\omega \\cdot 5 + 3$. I appreciate your detailed critique.",

You are correct that the correct recurrence should be $f(n, 3) = f(n-1, 1) + f(n-1, 2) + f(n-1, 3)$, as any of 1, 2, or 3 can precede 3. Additionally, the transition rules for $a_i = 1$ should indeed allow $a_{i+1}$ to be 1, 2, or 3. I appreciate your verification and correction. The correct total for $n=6$ is indeed 377.
