Find the exact value of $c$.\n\n**(c)** Use the quadrature rule from part (a) to approximate $\\displaystyle\\int_0^1 e^{-t^2}\\,dt$. Apply an appropriate linear transformation to convert the integral to the standard interval $[-1,1]$, then apply the rule. Express your answer in exact closed form.",
