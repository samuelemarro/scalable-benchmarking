        "message": "I acknowledge the errors in my previous response. The correct degree of the field extension is 20, not 5, as the splitting field contains all roots of $x^5 - 2$. The Galois group is the Frobenius group $F_{20}$, not $\text{Z}_5$, and the number of strict intermediate fields is indeed 12, not 0. Thank you for pointing out these corrections.",
