Determine the set $S \\subset \\partial \\Omega$ of points where the boundary $\\partial \\Omega$ is **not** strictly pseudoconvex.\n3.  Prove that $\\Omega$ is not biholomorphically equivalent to $\\mathbb{B}^2$.\n    *(Note: You may use the fact that any biholomorphic map between bounded domains in $\\mathbb{C}^n$ with smooth real-analytic boundaries extends to a smooth diffeomorphism of their closures.)*",

The coefficient for the $w$-component in the complex tangent space definition should be $\\frac{\\partial\\rho}{\\partial w} = 2w(\\bar{w})^2$. The provided answer uses $2w|w|^2$ (which equals $2w^2\\bar{w}$), which is the conjugate of the correct term.

However, this error does not affect the solution. For $w_0 \\neq 0$, the Hessian is positive definite, so $L(p;X) > 0$ for all nonzero $X$, regardless of the exact tangent condition. For $w_0 = 0$, the second term vanishes, so the condition reduces correctly to $\\bar z_0 X_1 = 0$. Thus the Levi form calculation and the identification of non\u2011strictly pseudoconvex points remain valid. The answer is mathematically correct and complete; the mistake is a minor slip that does not propagate.",

Since the Levi form is positive definite on the entire space $\\mathbb{C}^2$ for $w_0 \\neq 0$, it remains positive definite when restricted to any tangent hyperplane, regardless of the error in the coefficient. Furthermore, at $w_0 = 0$ (where the strict pseudoconvexity fails), the error vanishes. Thus, the characterization of the set $S$ and the subsequent biholomorphism proof are valid. I concede that the mistake in the tangent vector derivation is a minor calculation slip that does not invalidate the final results.",
