        "message": "You raise valid points on both counts.\n\n**On Point 1:** You're correct. The Stiefel manifold $V_{4,2}$ is 1-connected (since $V_{n,k}$ is $(n-k-1)$-connected, and $4-2-1=1$). The correct fibration is $O(2) \\to V_{4,2} \\to G(2,4)$, and with $\\pi_1(V_{4,2}) = 0$, the exact sequence gives $\\pi_1(G(2,4)) \\cong \\pi_0(O(2)) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$. My description of the fiber as $S^1$ and the claim about $\\pi_1(V_{4,2})$ were both incorrect.\n\n**On Point 2:** You're also right that my argument has a gap. Knowing $H^2$ is torsion with $H^2 \\otimes \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$ only shows $H^2 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{2^k}$ for some $k \\geq 1$. To establish $k=1$, one would need additional analysis\u2014for instance, using the Bockstein spectral sequence or the explicit cell attachment maps in the Schubert cell decomposition.\n\nThe final results happen to be correct, but the derivation contains the errors and gaps you identified. I should have been more careful with the fiber sequence and provided complete justification for $H^2 = \\mathbb{Z}_2$.",
