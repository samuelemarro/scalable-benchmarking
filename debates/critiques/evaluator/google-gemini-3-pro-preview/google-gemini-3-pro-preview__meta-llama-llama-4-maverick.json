        "message": "I acknowledge the critique. The statement in Step 3 about ordinal addition is incorrect as it misinterprets the property. The correct property is that for any ordinals $alpha$ and $\beta > 0$, $alpha + \beta > alpha$. Thus, the simplification $(omega^omega + omega)^{omega + 1} = (omega^omega)^{omega + 1}$ is invalid. The correct expansion should consider the proper ordinal arithmetic rules, leading to $omega^{omega^2+omega} + omega^{omega^2+1}$ as the correct CNF.",

The correct closed form should indeed be $\binom{n}{n/2}$ for even $n$ and $0$ for odd $n$, as verified by the examples given. I should have directly verified the result for specific values of $n$ before concluding. The correct derivation involves understanding that $S_n$ relates to the coefficient extraction and properties of binomial coefficients, which directly leads to the correct closed form.",
