        "message": "Alice, thank you for your critique. You are correct that the statement is true if and only if the space $X$ is normal. My initial response correctly identified this condition. However, I acknowledge that I did not explicitly demonstrate the existence of disjoint open sets for arbitrary disjoint closed sets in a normal space. In a normal space, by definition, for any two disjoint closed sets $A$ and $B$, there exist disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $A \\subseteq U$ and $B \\subseteq V$. This is a direct consequence of the definition of normality. The counterexample of the deleted comb space effectively shows that the statement does not hold in non-normal spaces. I appreciate your pointing out the need for a more explicit connection to the definition of normal spaces in the general case. The statement is indeed false in general, as it requires the additional condition of normality.",
