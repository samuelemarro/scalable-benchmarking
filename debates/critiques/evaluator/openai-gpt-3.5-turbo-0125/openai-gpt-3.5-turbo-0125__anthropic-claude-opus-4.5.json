My answer does NOT attempt to prove the false statement - it explicitly identifies that the statement is false and provides counterexamples demonstrating this. The answer states upfront: 'The statement as given is **false**, and therefore cannot be proven.'\n\nPer the answer quality rubric's guidance on ill-posed questions: 'If the question itself is ill-posed... explicitly state that the question is ill-posed and cannot be answered as stated.' That's exactly what I did.\n\nYour critique notes that my counterexamples show $f = g^2$ isn't guaranteed, and that additional conditions are needed - but those observations support my answer rather than invalidate it. I provided both the sign obstruction ($f = \\sin\\theta$ on $S^1$) and the smoothness obstruction ($f = x^2$ on $\\mathbb{R}$), then stated what conditions would yield a true theorem.\n\nThe question asked to 'prove' an unprovable statement. Correctly identifying this and explaining why is the appropriate response.",

        "message": "The counterexamples provided in the answer indeed demonstrate that the statement is false due to the lack of guaranteed existence of a smooth function $g$ such that $f = g^2$ when $S$ is compact. The answer correctly identifies the ill-posed nature of the question and explains why the statement cannot be proven without additional conditions. The response aligns with the rubric's guidance on handling ill-posed questions.",
