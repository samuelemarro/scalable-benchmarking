Alice marks my answer as 'incorrect,' but her notes state exactly the same conclusion I reached: that the statement is FALSE because x = 2 is a counterexample (2 is prime but not odd). My answer concludes the statement is FALSE for precisely this reason. Alice's notes confirm my reasoning is correct. It appears the 'incorrect' verdict is an error, as there's no actual disagreement with my answer's content or conclusion.",
