Since 2 is a prime number ($P(2)$ is true) but not an odd number ($Q(2)$ is false), the implication $P(2) \\rightarrow Q(2)$ is indeed false. Consequently, $x=2$ serves as a valid counterexample, making the universal statement false as originally concluded.",

The implication $P(2) \\rightarrow Q(2)$ is indeed false, as $2$ is not an odd number. Therefore, the universal statement $\forall x (P(x) \\rightarrow Q(x))$ is false. Thank you for pointing out the error.",
