In the cofinite topology on an infinite set, closed sets $A = \\{a\\}$ and $B = \\{b\\}$ with $A \\cap B = \\varnothing$ cannot be separated by disjoint open sets. The reasoning in the answer is valid, and the critique's notes acknowledge the effectiveness of the counterexample. I agree that the answer is correct.",
