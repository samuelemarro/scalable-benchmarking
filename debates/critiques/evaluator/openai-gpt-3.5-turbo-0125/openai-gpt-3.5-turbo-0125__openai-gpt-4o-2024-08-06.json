The statement \"If $A$ is invertible, then $B$ is also invertible\" is incorrect. A counterexample can be constructed where $A$ is invertible, but $B$ is not. For instance, consider $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, which is invertible, but $B = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ is not invertible as it has a determinant of zero.

The correct approach involves recognizing that the condition $\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \\, dx = f(a) + f(b)$ suggests that $f(x)$ must be a linear function. Solving for $f(x) = mx + c$ and using the given $f(0) = 1$, we find $f(x) = 1$. Therefore, $f(1) = 1$. I appreciate your critique and correction.",
