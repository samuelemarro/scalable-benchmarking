    "question": "## Step 1: Understand the task and the domain\nThe task is to generate a challenging but solvable mathematics problem in the domain of \"Several complex variables and analytic spaces\" along with a complete and verifiable solution. The problem should be well-posed, clear, non-trivial, and solvable with established mathematical methods.\n\n## Step 2: Identify key concepts in the domain\nSeveral complex variables and analytic spaces involve the study of functions of multiple complex variables and the spaces on which these functions are defined. Key concepts include holomorphic functions, complex manifolds, analytic continuation, and various types of domains (e.g., domains of holomorphy, pseudoconvex domains).\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a problem\nTo create a problem, we need to focus on a specific aspect of several complex variables. Let's consider the concept of holomorphic functions on a domain in $\\mathbb{C}^n$. A potential problem could involve characterizing or analyzing the properties of such functions.\n\n## Step 4: Specify the problem\nLet's formulate a problem related to the extension of holomorphic functions. A well-known result in several complex variables is the Hartogs' extension theorem, which states that any holomorphic function defined on a domain in $\\mathbb{C}^n$ ($n > 1$) with a compact hole can be extended holomorphically to the whole domain. We can create a problem related to this concept.\n\n## Step 5: Create the problem statement\nConsider the domain $\\Omega = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}^2 : |z_1| < 1, |z_2| < 1\\}$ and the subset $S = \\{z \\in \\Omega : |z_1| < \\frac{1}{2}\\}$. Let $f$ be a holomorphic function on $\\Omega \\setminus S$. Show that $f$ can be extended to a holomorphic function on $\\Omega$.\n\n## Step 6: Provide the solution\nTo solve this, we recognize that $\\Omega \\setminus S$ is not a compact hole in $\\Omega$, so we cannot directly apply Hartogs' theorem. However, we can analyze the problem by considering the properties of holomorphic functions in $\\mathbb{C}^2$ and the specific geometry of $\\Omega$ and $S$.\n\n## Step 7: Detail the solution\nFor $z = (z_1, z_2) \\in \\Omega \\setminus S$, $f(z)$ is holomorphic. We need to show that $f$ can be extended holomorphically to $\\Omega$. For any fixed $z_2$ with $|z_2| < 1$, $f(z_1, z_2)$ is holomorphic in $z_1$ for $\\frac{1}{2} \\leq |z_1| < 1$. By the principle of analytic continuation in one variable, if $f(z_1, z_2)$ is holomorphic for $|z_1| < 1$ except on a smaller disk, it can be extended. However, the direct application of Hartogs' theorem is not possible here due to the shape of $S$. Instead, we can use the fact that for each $z_2$, $f(\\cdot, z_2)$ can be extended to $|z_1| < 1$ because the singularity set is contained within $|z_1| \\leq \\frac{1}{2}$, and then apply Hartogs' theorem or a similar principle to conclude the extension is holomorphic in both variables.\n\n## Step 8: Write the problem and solution in the required format\n\nLet $\\Omega = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}^2 : |z_1| < 1, |z_2| < 1\\}$ and $S = \\{z \\in \\Omega : |z_1| < \\frac{1}{2}\\}$. Suppose $f$ is a holomorphic function on $\\Omega \\setminus S$. Prove that $f$ can be extended to a holomorphic function on $\\Omega$.",
