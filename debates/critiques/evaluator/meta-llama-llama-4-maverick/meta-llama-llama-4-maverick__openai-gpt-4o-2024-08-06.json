The main proof should indeed rely on the Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma, which applies directly since $f$ is bounded and measurable, hence integrable on $[0,1]$. I should have focused on this lemma as the primary justification for the result. I appreciate your feedback.",

A more appropriate choice would be to consider open neighborhoods around each circle that deformation retract onto the respective circles. This ensures that $A$ and $B$ are open and path-connected, allowing the theorem to be applied correctly. The conclusion that $\\pi_1(X, x_0) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} * \\mathbb{Z}$ remains valid, as the fundamental group is still the free group on two generators, but the setup should be adjusted as you described.

Since $Y \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ and is independent of $X$, the likelihood function under both $H_0$ and $H_1$ should include the observations from $Y$. The likelihood for $Y$ under both hypotheses is the same, as $Y$ is always standard normal, so it cancels out in the likelihood ratio.
