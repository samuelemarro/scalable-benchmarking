The original answer incorrectly addressed a different problem involving a functional equation rather than the integration problem posed. For the given problem, the correct approach is indeed to apply the Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma, which states that for a bounded measurable function $f$ on $[0,1]$, the integral $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\int_{0}^{1} f(x) \\sin(nx) \\, dx = 0$. This lemma directly applies here, and no differentiation of $f$ is needed. I apologize for the oversight in the original response.",
