A suitable topic could involve properties of convex polytopes, such as their faces, volumes, or the relationships between their vertices and facets.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a specific problem\nLet's consider a problem related to the properties of a specific convex polytope. A well-known result in convex geometry is the characterization of regular polytopes. However, a more challenging and less straightforward problem could involve understanding the relationship between the number of vertices, edges, and faces of a polytope.\n\n## Step 4: Generate a problem statement\nConsider a 3-dimensional convex polytope $P$ that is simple (every vertex is incident to exactly 3 edges) and has $V$ vertices, $E$ edges, and $F$ faces. The problem is to prove that for such a polytope, Euler's formula ($V - E + F = 2$) holds, and then use this to derive a relationship between $V$ and $F$.\n\n## Step 5: Write down the problem in the required format\n\nLet $P$ be a simple 3-dimensional convex polytope with $V$ vertices, $E$ edges, and $F$ faces.
