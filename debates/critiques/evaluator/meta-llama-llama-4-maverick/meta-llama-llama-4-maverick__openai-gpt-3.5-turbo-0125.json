If true, provide a proof; if false, provide a counterexample.",

While referencing Bertrand's Postulate or Chebyshev's result would indeed strengthen the argument, the original task was to formalize the given statement and determine its truth value. The formalization was correct, but the proof was incomplete. A proper citation or proof referencing established results would suffice. I now consider the matter addressed.",
