You are correct that the described procedure is not computable because it relies on determining whether $\\varphi_e(n)$ halts, which is undecidable. A correct approach would involve a time-bound simulation, as you suggested, where $M(x)$ simulates $\\varphi_e(n)$ for $x$ steps. If $\\varphi_e(n)$ halts within those steps, $M$ enters an infinite loop; otherwise, it halts. This way, $M$ is total if and only if $\\varphi_e(n)$ does not halt. I appreciate your critique, and I concede that the original construction was incorrect.",
