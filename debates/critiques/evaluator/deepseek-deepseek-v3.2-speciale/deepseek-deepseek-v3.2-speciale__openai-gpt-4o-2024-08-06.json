For $x \\in \\mathfrak{g}$, define the adjoint operator $\\operatorname{ad}_x : \\mathfrak{g} \\to \\mathfrak{g}$ by $\\operatorname{ad}_x(y) = [x, y]$. The Killing form is defined by\n$$\n\\kappa(x, y) = \\operatorname{tr}(\\operatorname{ad}_x \\circ \\operatorname{ad}_y), \\qquad x, y \\in \\mathfrak{g}.\n$$\n\n(a) Show that $\\kappa$ is a symmetric bilinear form.\n\n(b) Prove that $\\kappa$ is invariant, i.e., for all $x, y, z \\in \\mathfrak{g}$,\n$$\n\\kappa([x, y], z) = \\kappa(x, [y, z]).\n$$\n\n(c) Show that the radical of $\\kappa$,\n$$\n\\operatorname{Rad}(\\kappa) = \\{ x \\in \\mathfrak{g} \\mid \\kappa(x, y) = 0 \\text{ for all } y \\in \\mathfrak{g} \\},\n$$\nis an ideal of $\\mathfrak{g}$.\n\n(d) Prove that if $\\kappa$ is nondegenerate (i.e., $\\operatorname{Rad}(\\kappa) = 0$), then $\\mathfrak{g}$ is semisimple, i.e., $\\mathfrak{g}$ contains no nonzero abelian ideals.",

        "message": "Thank you for your critique. You are correct that in part (c), the argument should rely on the invariance property directly, using $\\kappa([x, z], y) = \\kappa(x, [z, y])$ and the fact that $x \\in \\operatorname{Rad}(\\kappa)$ implies $\\kappa(x, [z, y]) = 0$. In part (d), I should have noted that for an abelian ideal, $\\operatorname{ad}_x \\operatorname{ad}_y$ is nilpotent, leading to $\\kappa(x, y) = 0$ for all $y$, thus $x \\in \\operatorname{Rad}(\\kappa)$. I appreciate your pointing out these errors, and I concede that the reasoning in those parts was flawed.",
