You are correct that the described procedure is not computable because it relies on determining whether $\\varphi_e(n)$ halts, which is undecidable. A valid approach would indeed involve a time-bound simulation, such as simulating $\\varphi_e(n)$ for a fixed number of steps and then deciding based on that. I appreciate your critique, and I concede that the original construction was incorrect.",
