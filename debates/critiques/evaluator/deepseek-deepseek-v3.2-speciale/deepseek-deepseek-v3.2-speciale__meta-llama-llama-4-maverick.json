Let $H = \\pi^* \\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{P}^2}(1)$ be the pullback of the hyperplane class.\n\n(a) Show that $\\varphi$ lifts to a morphism $\\Phi: X \\to \\mathbb{P}^2$ (i.e., $\\Phi = \\varphi \\circ \\pi$ is a morphism).\n(b) Compute the class of the line bundle $\\Phi^* \\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{P}^2}(1)$ in $\\operatorname{Pic}(X)$ in terms of $H, E_1, E_2, E_3$.\n(c) Prove that $\\varphi$ is birational and determine its inverse rational map.",

The answer provided does not address the given question about the rational map $\bvarphi: \bP^2 \to \bP^2$ and its properties, but instead solves a different differential equation. The critique correctly identifies errors in part (c) of the expected answer and notes that part (b) is correct. I will make sure to address the actual question and provide a correct solution.",
