Furthermore, even if the identity were correct, the subsequent simplification incorrectly omits the $(-1)^n$ factor. I should have verified these steps more carefully.",

A more thorough analysis for $y > 3$ is needed to show that $y^3 - 2$ cannot be a perfect square for larger $y$. I will need to provide a more detailed argument or check larger values systematically to ensure completeness.",

To correctly prove idempotence, we can directly use the given condition: setting $b = a$ yields $a = a^3$, and then using $a = aaa$ and associativity, we can simplify it correctly. For $xyz = xz$, the steps provided are not coherent. A correct approach would involve using the given condition and idempotence properly. I will revisit and correct my proof.",
