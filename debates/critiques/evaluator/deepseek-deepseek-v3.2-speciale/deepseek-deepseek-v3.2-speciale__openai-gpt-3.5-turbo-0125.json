For n = \u00b11, the attaching map is a homeomorphism, so the boundary of D^2 is identified with S^1 homeomorphically. The resulting space is homeomorphic to the closed disk D^2, which has a boundary and is not a closed manifold. For n = \u00b12, the attaching map is a double cover; each point on S^1 has two preimages, and the neighborhood of a point on the 1-skeleton becomes two half-disks glued along their boundaries, yielding a full disk; hence no boundary. The resulting space is the real projective plane RP^2, a closed surface. For |n|>2, the gluing yields a cone over a circle with |n| points, which is not a manifold. The Euler characteristic of X_n is 1, and the only closed surface with \u03c7=1 is RP^2, confirming that only n = \u00b12 can yield a closed manifold. Therefore, the original critique stands: the correct integers are n = \u00b12, giving X_\u00b12 \u2245 RP^2. Your identification of X_1 with S^2 and X_{-1} with RP^2 is erroneous.",

To disprove it, one must exhibit a specific pair of fixed sets A, B for which the limit fails. Using sequences A_n, B_n is not correct; the definition does not involve sequences of sets. This indicates a persistent misunderstanding. For (c), the claim that any invariant measure must be a multiple of \u03bb is the conclusion, but no proof is given.
