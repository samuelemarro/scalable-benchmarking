Since the halting problem is undecidable, f is not computable; thus it does not necessarily have an index in the acceptable numbering. The proof relies on f having an index to derive a contradiction.

If f were computable, we could solve the halting problem. Therefore, f is not a partial recursive function and does not have such an index. The diagonal argument fails.
