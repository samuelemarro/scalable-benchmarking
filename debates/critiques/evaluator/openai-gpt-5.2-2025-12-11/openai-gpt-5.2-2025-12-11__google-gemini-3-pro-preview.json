Using the standard sign convention $d_{P[-1]} = -d_P$, the condition is $d_{P[-1]} f_k = f_{k-1} d_P$, which becomes $-\\varepsilon f_k = f_{k-1} \\varepsilon$. If we choose $f_k = \\operatorname{id}_A$ for all $k$, we get $-\\varepsilon a = \\varepsilon a$. In characteristic $\\neq 2$, this requires modification.

Since the generator of $\\operatorname{Ext}^2$ is the square of the generator of $\\operatorname{Ext}^1$, we have $x^2 \\neq 0$. Thus, the algebra is polynomial.\n4.  **Koszul Duality:** Since $A = k[\\varepsilon]/(\\varepsilon^2)$ is a Koszul algebra (it has a linear resolution), its Ext-algebra is isomorphic to its Koszul dual $A^!$. The quadratic dual of the exterior algebra $A \\cong \\Lambda(V)$ is the symmetric algebra $A^! \\cong S(V^*) \\cong k[t]$.
