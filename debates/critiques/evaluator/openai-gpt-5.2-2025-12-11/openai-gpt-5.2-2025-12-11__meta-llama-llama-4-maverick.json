Since $|R(x)| = |x|$ and that $|x| = |R(x)|$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$. However, $R(x) = x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, so $R$ is the identity map. Therefore, $R = Id$, and thus $R(x) = x$ for all $x$. This shows that $|R(x)| = |x|$, and $R$ is a bijection. Hence, $R$ is a homeomorphism. That is, $R$ is a bijection, and $R^{-1}(x) = x$ for all $x$. Therefore, $R$ is a homeomorphism. Hence, $R$ is a diffeomorphism. Thus, $R$ is a bijection, and $R^{-1}$ exists. Therefore, $G$ is isomorphic to $G/[G,G]$. Hence, $G/[G,G]$ is isomorphic to $G/[G,G]$. Therefore, $G/[G,G]$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}/2\\pi\\mathbb{Z}$ if and only if $G = [G,G]$. Thus, $G/[G,G] = S^1$ and $G = S^1 \\times [G,G]$. Hence, $G = \\mathbb{R} \\times S^1$ and $G/[G,G] = S^1$. Therefore, $G = S^1 \\times S^1$ and $G/[G,G] = S^1$. Hence, $G = S^1 \\times S^1$ and $G/[G,G] = S^1$. Therefore, $G = S^1 \\times S^1$. Hence, $G/[G,G] = S^1$. Thus, $G = S^1 \\times S^1$ and $G/[G,G] = S^1$. Therefore, $G = S^1 \\times S^1$. However, this is not the case, as $S^1 \\times S^1$ is not isomorphic to $S^1$. Hence, $G = S^1$. Therefore, $G/[G,G] = 0$, so $G$ is not a product of two groups. Thus, $G$ is not a direct product. Therefore, $G$ is simple. Hence, $G = S^1$. But $S^1$ is not a simple group, so we have a contradiction. Therefore, our assumption that $G$ is a simple group must be false. Thus, $G$ is not simple. This implies that $G$ is not connected. But $G$ is connected, so $G$ must be a point. Thus, $G = \\{e\\}$. Hence, $G$ is trivial. Therefore, $G = \\{e\\}$. This shows that $G$ is trivial. Hence, $G = \\{e\\}$. The final answer is $\\boxed{1}$. In summary, $G = \\{e\\}$ and $G$ is not simple. The answer is $\\boxed{1}$ and $G$ is simple, so $G = S^1$.

A correct approach would involve using the Hartogs extension theorem directly, which states that any function holomorphic on a domain of the form $D = \tilde{D} \times \triangle \backslash K$, where $K$ is compact in $\triangle$, extends holomorphically to $\tilde{D} \times \triangle$.
