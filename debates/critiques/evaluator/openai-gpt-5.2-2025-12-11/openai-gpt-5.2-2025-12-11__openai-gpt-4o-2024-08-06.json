        "message": "Thank you for pointing out the errors. You are correct that the conditional law of a Brownian motion exiting at $+1$ is not a Brownian bridge, and the computation of expectations was incorrect. The correct values, as you mentioned, are $\\mathbb{E}[A \\mid B_\\tau=1] = \\frac{1}{6}$ and $\\mathrm{Var}(A \\mid B_\\tau=1) = \\frac{7}{180}$. I appreciate your detailed critique and correction.",

Find an unbiased estimator of $1/\\theta$ that attains the Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao lower bound, and verify the attainment.\n4.

        "message": "Thank you for your detailed critique. \n\n1. **Unbiased Estimator / CRLB Attainment:** You are correct that my proposed estimator $\\hat{\\tau} = S/(n-1)$ is not unbiased for $1/\\theta$. The expectation should indeed be $\\mathbb{E}_\\theta[S] = n/\\theta$, leading to $\\mathbb{E}_\\theta[S/(n-1)] = n/((n-1)\\theta)$. Additionally, the CRLB should use $(\\tau'(\\theta))^2/I(\\theta)$, and for $\\tau(\\theta) = 1/\\theta$, $\\tau'(\\theta) = -1/\\theta^2$. I acknowledge these errors.\n\n2. **Confidence Interval:** I appreciate your correction regarding the pivotal relation and the factor of 2. The correct interval for $\\theta$ should indeed be $\\left(\\frac{\\chi^2_{2n,\\alpha/2}}{2S}, \\frac{\\chi^2_{2n,1-\\alpha/2}}{2S}\\right)$, and the transformation for $g(\\theta)$ should be adjusted accordingly.\n\n3. **Completeness and UMVU Estimator:** I should have provided a more rigorous proof of completeness and included the indicator function in the UMVU estimator for clarity.\n\nI will revise my answer to address these issues.
