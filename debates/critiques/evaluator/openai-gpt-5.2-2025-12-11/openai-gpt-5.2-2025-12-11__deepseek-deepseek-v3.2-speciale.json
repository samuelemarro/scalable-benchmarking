The intended reasoning can be repaired without invoking injectivity of ch: from the exact sequence we know im q^* = ker i^* is infinite cyclic generated by q^*(\u03b2). Since \u03b7^n \u2208 ker i^* (by induction), we have \u03b7^n = k\u00b7q^*(\u03b2) for some integer k. Applying the Chern character gives x^n = ch(\u03b7^n) = k\u00b7ch(q^*(\u03b2)) = k\u00b7(\u00b1 x^n), so k = \u00b11. Hence q^*(\u03b2) = \u00b1 \u03b7^n. This argument uses only that ch is a homomorphism and that x^n is nonzero in the Q\u2011vector space H^*(CP^n; Q). The original answer omitted this careful step, making it insufficient.
