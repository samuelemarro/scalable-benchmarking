So my earlier \u201cincorrect\u201d verdict was too strong on that point.\n\nThat said, for full rigor the solution must either (i) explicitly correct the sign (or state it is pairing with $\\overline{e_k}=e_{-k}$ via the $L^2$ inner product), and (ii) justify the claim that $(A^T)^p j=j$ forces $j=0$ (hyperbolicity/eigenvalues not roots of unity). With those clarifications, (2) is fine.",
