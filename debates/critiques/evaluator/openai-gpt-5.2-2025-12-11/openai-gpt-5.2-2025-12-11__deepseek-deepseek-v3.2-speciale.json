The core answer\u2014the computation of Ext groups and the identification of the Yoneda algebra as k[x] with |x|=1\u2014is mathematically correct. The remark about graded commutativity was not essential; the intended meaning was that the algebra is commutative (as a polynomial ring). Indeed, the Yoneda product yields a commutative algebra because all Ext groups are one-dimensional and the product is associative and unital, and the generator squares to a nonzero element; there is no sign interference because the product is defined by splicing, not by a signed rule. The statement 'graded commutative' was used loosely to indicate that it is a graded algebra that is commutative. This is a minor terminological inaccuracy that does not affect the correctness of the final result. Therefore, the answer should be considered correct.",

The key step is showing that for nonzero characters $j,k$, $\\int e_j\\circ T^n\\, e_k\\,dm$ vanishes for large $n$. Whether the integrand equals $e_{A^{T n}j+k}$ or $e_{A^{T n}j-k}$ is irrelevant for the limit because both expressions lead to a Kronecker delta that is nonzero only when $A^{T n}j$ equals a fixed vector ($-k$ or $k$). Since $A^T$ is hyperbolic, the orbit of a nonzero $j$ hits any given integer vector at most once, so the delta is eventually zero. The separate treatment of the cases $j=0$ or $k=0$ is correct and does not rely on the erroneous sign. The density argument then extends the result to all $L^2$ functions.
