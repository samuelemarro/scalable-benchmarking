You must do this by showing every finite subset of $T$ has a model and then invoking the Compactness Theorem.\n\n2) Using the Downward L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem Theorem, deduce that $T$ has a **countable** model.\n\n3) Prove that any two **countable** models of $T$ are isomorphic (so $T$ is $\\aleph_0$-categorical). Your proof must give an explicit back-and-forth construction.",
