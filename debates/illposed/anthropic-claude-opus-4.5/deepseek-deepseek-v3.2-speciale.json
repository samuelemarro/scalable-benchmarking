    "question": "Consider the two-point Gaussian quadrature rule for approximating integrals over $[-1, 1]$:\n$$\\int_{-1}^{1} f(x)\\,dx \\approx w_1 f(x_1) + w_2 f(x_2)$$\n\n**(a)** Determine the nodes $x_1, x_2 \\in [-1,1]$ and positive weights $w_1, w_2$ such that this quadrature rule is exact for all polynomials of degree at most 3.\n\n**(b)** For a function $f \\in C^4([-1,1])$, the quadrature error can be expressed as \n$$E(f) = \\int_{-1}^{1} f(x)\\,dx - w_1 f(x_1) - w_2 f(x_2) = c \\cdot f^{(4)}(\\xi)$$\nfor some $\\xi \\in (-1,1)$ and a constant $c$ independent of $f$. Find the exact value of $c$.\n\n**(c)** Use the quadrature rule from part (a) to approximate $\\displaystyle\\int_0^1 e^{-t^2}\\,dt$. Apply an appropriate linear transformation to convert the integral to the standard interval $[-1,1]$, then apply the rule. Express your answer in exact closed form.",

The question is a mathematics problem asking the solver to *derive* answers, not a submission requesting evaluation of a provided answer.\n\nThe question is well-posed:\n\n**(a)** Asks for nodes and weights making the rule exact for polynomials up to degree 3. This has a unique solution: the classical 2-point Gauss-Legendre quadrature with $x_{1,2} = \\pm 1/\\sqrt{3}$ and $w_1 = w_2 = 1$.\n\n**(b)** The error constant $c$ is uniquely determined by the quadrature rule and is a standard result in numerical analysis.\n\n**(c)** The transformation from $[0,1]$ to $[-1,1]$ is standard (linear change of variables), and applying the quadrature yields a closed-form expression.\n\nAll three parts have unique, verifiable answers derivable through established methods. The domain, constraints, and expected answer formats are all clearly specified. The claim that 'the answer to be evaluated is missing' conflates this well-posed question with some other evaluation context.",
