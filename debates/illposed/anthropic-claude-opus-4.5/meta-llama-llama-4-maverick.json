The question is a well-posed problem in Banach algebra theory with three clear parts:\n\n(a) Asks to describe the Pontryagin dual $\\widehat{\\mathbb{Z}}$ (which is the unit circle $\\mathbb{T}$) and state the Gelfand transform formula.\n\n(b) Asks to compute $\\hat{a}(z) = 2 - z$ for the explicitly defined element $a$.\n\n(c) Asks whether $a$ is invertible\u2014this has a definite answer (yes, since $|2-z| \\geq 1 > 0$ on $\\mathbb{T}$) and the inverse is explicitly computable as $a^{-1}(n) = 2^{-(n+1)}$ for $n \\geq 0$, zero otherwise.\n\nAlice's complaints about \"no target response to evaluate,\" \"generic evaluation steps,\" and \"$\\boxed{0}$\" have absolutely no connection to this question. There is no evaluation task here\u2014this is a straightforward mathematical problem with fully specified objects, clear tasks, and unique verifiable answers.

The question is indeed well-posed as it clearly defines the Banach algebra, specifies the element $a$, and asks well-defined questions about the Gelfand transform and invertibility. Each part of the question has a clear and verifiable answer based on the given information and standard results in Banach algebra theory.
