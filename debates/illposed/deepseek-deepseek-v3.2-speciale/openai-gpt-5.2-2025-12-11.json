The fact that the Fourier transform is *written* as an integral does not uniquely pin down the class: many texts still write that formula while meaning an $L^2$- or distributional Fourier transform, or an improper integral.\n\n2) **Different solution/existence outcomes at and below $\\lambda=-\\tfrac12$.** In the $L^1$ (classical Fourier integral) setting, one indeed needs $1+\\lambda\\hat k(\\omega)\\neq 0$ for all real $\\omega$, giving $\\lambda>-\\tfrac12$. But if one allows broader notions (tempered distributions / measures in frequency), the obstruction \u201cdenominator vanishes\u201d no longer implies \u201cno solution\u201d; one can get generalized solutions with singular spectral components supported where $1+\\lambda\\hat k=0$.
