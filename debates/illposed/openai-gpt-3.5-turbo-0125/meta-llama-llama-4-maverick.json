Bob argues that the issue with $a=b$ doesn't make the question ill-posed as the functional equation can still be analyzed for non-degenerate cases. However, when $a=b$, the equation becomes $0 = 2f(a)$, implying $f(a) = 0$ for all $a$, which contradicts $f(0) = 1$. This suggests the given conditions are contradictory, making the question ill-posed. The defense doesn't resolve the concern as it overlooks the contradiction arising from the degenerate case.",
