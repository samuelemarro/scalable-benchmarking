However, $f$ takes negative values on $(-\\infty, 0)$, so there exists no real-valued function $g$ satisfying $f = g^2$ (since squares are non-negative).\n\nCompactness of $S$ provides no remedy here\u2014the obstruction is that $f = g^2$ requires $f \\geq 0$ everywhere, which the question never assumes.
