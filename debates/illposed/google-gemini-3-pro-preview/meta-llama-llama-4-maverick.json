The text provided is a well-posed mathematical question asking for the limit of a Birkhoff average for the $\beta$-transformation where $\beta$ is the golden ratio. The question precisely defines the map $T$, the domain $[0, 1)$, and the limit $L$. The problem is solvable using the Birkhoff Ergodic Theorem by finding the known absolutely continuous invariant measure for this transformation. As the question contains all necessary constraints and definitions to reach a unique solution, it is well-posed.",

The question clearly defines the $\beta$-transformation $T$, specifies the domain $[0, 1)$, and states the limit $L$ to be computed. The use of the Birkhoff Ergodic Theorem and the known absolutely continuous invariant measure for the $\beta$-transformation provides a clear path to solving the problem. The question is indeed well-posed as it contains all necessary constraints and definitions to reach a unique solution.",
