This is a standard problem in ergodic theory solvable via the Birkhoff Ergodic Theorem by finding the unique absolutely continuous invariant measure (the Parry measure) for $\\beta = \\phi$.",

The question clearly states the domain and codomain of $f$ and provides a specific functional equation. The notation is standard, and the task is well-defined.
