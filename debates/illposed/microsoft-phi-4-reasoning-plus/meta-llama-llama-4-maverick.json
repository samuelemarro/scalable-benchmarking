Let's address the claim of ill-posedness:\n\n1. **Well-Posedness and Completeness**: The question specifies that $F$ is a field and $f(x)$ is a polynomial in $F[x]$. It provides the condition that $f(x)$ is irreducible over $F$ and has a root $\beta$ in some extension field $E$ of $F$. The task is to prove $[K : F] = 4$, determine the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha^2$ over $F$, and show the relationship between the roots. The domain, constraints, and assumptions are clear and sufficient for these tasks.\n\n2. **Clarity**: Each term and notation used in the question is standard in field theory and polynomial algebra. The terms 'field', 'irreducible', 'extension field', and 'minimal polynomial' have well-defined meanings in this context.\n\n3. **Non-Triviality**: The question requires understanding of field extensions, irreducibility, and minimal polynomials, which are non-trivial concepts in abstract algebra. Solving these parts involves substantive mathematical reasoning.\n\n4. **Solvability and Verification**: The question is solvable using established methods in algebra, such as properties of field extensions and irreducible polynomials. The solutions can be verified through clear mathematical arguments.\n\nThe claim of ill-posedness seems to stem from a misunderstanding of the question's format rather than its content. The question is complete and clear, with all necessary information provided to reach a solution. Therefore, I do not concede to the claim of ill-posedness.",

These are clear constraints that define the problem space. The length constraint can be expressed as:\n   $$\\int_0^1 \\sqrt{1 + (y')^2} \\, dx = 2$$\n   This is a well-defined condition that can be used in conjunction with the Euler-Lagrange equation to find the curve that minimizes the functional $J[y]$.\n\n2. **Functional Minimization**: The functional $J[y] = \\int_0^1 (y')^2 \\, dx$ is a standard problem in the calculus of variations. The problem is to find a curve that minimizes this functional subject to the given constraints. The Euler-Lagrange equation for this functional, along with the length constraint, can be used to derive the necessary conditions for the solution.\n\n3. **Existence of Solution**: While the problem does not provide an explicit solution, it is a well-posed problem in the sense that it is a standard variational problem with boundary conditions and an integral constraint. The existence of a solution can be argued based on the theory of calculus of variations, which guarantees solutions under certain regularity conditions.\n\n4. **Rigorous Derivation**: The problem invites a detailed derivation, which is a common expectation in mathematical problem statements. The derivation would involve setting up the Euler-Lagrange equation with the length constraint as a Lagrange multiplier, solving the resulting differential equation, and verifying that the solution satisfies all given conditions.\n\nIn summary, the problem is well-posed as it provides all necessary information to set up and solve the variational problem.
