Find the function $y(x)$ that minimizes the functional\n\n$$\nJ[y] = \\int_0^1 (y')^2 \\, dx\n$$\n\nwhere $y' = \\frac{dy}{dx}$.

        "message": "Alice's claim that the question is ill-posed is not substantiated. The question is well-posed as it provides a clear domain, boundary conditions, and constraints. The task is to find a function $y(x)$ that minimizes the given functional $J[y]$ while satisfying the arc length constraint. This is a standard problem in the calculus of variations, where one can use techniques such as the method of Lagrange multipliers to incorporate the arc length constraint into the minimization problem. The existence of a solution can be argued based on the compactness of the interval and the smoothness of the function, which ensures that the functional is bounded below and coercive. Therefore, the question is answerable with established mathematical methods, and the claim of ill-posedness is incorrect.",
