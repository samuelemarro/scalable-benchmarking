The criticism focuses on the validity of a particular proof regarding the irreducibility of $p(x)$ and the determination of its Galois group. However, the question about the condition for the Galois group of $p(x)$ to be isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ is well-posed as it clearly specifies the task: to prove the given statement about the Galois group and irreducibility. The issues raised pertain to the solution method, not the question's clarity or completeness. Therefore, the question is well-posed according to the criteria.",

        "message": "The defense mischaracterizes the issue: the ill-posedness is not about a solution attempt but about the question statement itself. The problem asks to prove a statement that is not true for all fields. Specifically, it omits the necessary condition that the characteristic of F is not 2. In characteristic 2, the discriminant of any separable cubic is always a square (since $-1 = 1$), yet there exist irreducible cubics whose Galois group is $S_3$ (not $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$). For example, over $F = \\mathbb{F}_2(t)$, the polynomial $x^3 + x + t$ is irreducible, has distinct roots, its discriminant $t^2$ is a square, but its Galois group is $S_3$. Thus the \"if and only if\" fails in characteristic 2. The statement relies on the equivalence between the discriminant being a square and the Galois group being a subgroup of $A_3$, which holds only when $\\operatorname{char} F \\neq 2$. Without this restriction, the question is not universally true and therefore ill\u2011posed. This violates the completeness and solvability criteria of the rubric. I do not concede.",

        "message": "The defense does not resolve the issue. The question remains ill-posed because it fails to exclude characteristic 2, where the statement is false. A concrete counterexample: let $F = \\mathbb{F}_2(t)$, the rational function field over the field with two elements. Take $p(x) = x^3 - t = x^3 + 0\\cdot x + (-t)$, which is of the form $x^3 + ax + b$ with $a=0$, $b=-t$. Since $t$ is transcendental, $p$ is irreducible, has distinct roots (the three cube roots of $t$ are distinct because a primitive cube root of unity exists in characteristic 2 and is not 1), and its discriminant is $\\Delta = -4a^3 -27b^2 = t^2$, which is a square in $F$. However, the Galois group of $p$ over $F$ is $S_3$, not $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$, as the splitting field is $F(\\sqrt[3]{t}, \\omega)$ with $\\omega^2+\\omega+1=0$, which has degree $6$. Thus the claimed equivalence (irreducible $\\iff$ Galois group $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$) fails in characteristic 2. Therefore, the problem must include the assumption $\\operatorname{char} F \\neq 2$ to be correct. Without this, the question is ill\u2011posed.",

The assumption that $\\operatorname{char} F \\neq 2$ (and possibly $\\operatorname{char} F \\neq 3$) is necessary for the claimed equivalence to hold. I concede that without specifying the characteristic of $F$, the question is indeed ill-posed as it doesn't cover all cases, particularly those in characteristic 2. The original statement implicitly assumes a characteristic 0 or characteristic not equal to 2 context, which isn't explicitly stated.",
