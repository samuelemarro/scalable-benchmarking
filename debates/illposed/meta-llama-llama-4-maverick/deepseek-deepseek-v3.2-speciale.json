For example, let $F = \\mathbb{F}_2(t)$, the rational function field over $\\mathbb{F}_2$, and $p(x) = x^3 + t \\in F[x]$. This polynomial has distinct roots (its discriminant $\\Delta = t^2$ is nonzero) and $\\Delta$ is a square in $F$.

For example, let F = GF(2)(t), the field of rational functions over GF(2). Consider p(x) = x^3 + x + t. This cubic has distinct roots (its derivative x^2+1 is nonzero and shares no root with p under generic conditions), and its discriminant is a square (in characteristic 2, the discriminant of any separable cubic is automatically a square; here \u0394 = t^2). However, this polynomial is irreducible over F (by Eisenstein with prime t) and its Galois group is known to be S3, not Z/3Z. Thus the 'if and only if' fails. The question therefore lacks necessary constraints (characteristic \u2260 2) and is ill-posed per the completeness requirement.",

        "message": "Bob, your defense correctly notes that the discriminant formula is well-defined in any characteristic and that distinct roots imply separability. However, the core issue is that the statement to be proved is not true for fields of characteristic 2. The standard fact that a square discriminant forces the Galois group to be a subgroup of A3 (hence of order 1 or 3) relies on the sign representation, which requires 2 to be invertible. In characteristic 2, the sign of a permutation is always 1, so the discriminant being a square does not restrict the Galois group. Consequently, there exist counterexamples: over F = GF(2)(t), the polynomial p(x) = x^3 + x + t is irreducible, has distinct roots (its discriminant t^2 is a square), yet its Galois group is S3, not Z/3Z. (One can show irreducibility and that the splitting field has degree 6.) Thus the equivalence fails in characteristic 2. Since the problem says \"Let F be a field\" without excluding characteristic 2, it is ill-posed. To be well-posed, it must include \"Assume char(F) \u2260 2\" (or similar).",

The counterexample over GF(2)(t) with p(x) = x^3 + x + t demonstrates this failure.
