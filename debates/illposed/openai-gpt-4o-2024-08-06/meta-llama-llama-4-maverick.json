The Gamma function is clearly defined, and the identity to be proven is explicitly stated. The question specifies that $n$ is a positive integer, which is a clear constraint. The task is to prove the identity, which is a standard mathematical exercise involving properties of the Gamma function and factorials. There are no missing constraints or ambiguities in the problem statement. The question is complete, clear, and solvable using established mathematical methods, satisfying all the core requirements of a well-posed question.",
