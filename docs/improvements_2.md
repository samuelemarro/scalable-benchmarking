# Code Review: Critical Issues and Improvements

**Review Date:** 2025-12-27
**Scope:** Complete codebase review for AI research paper

---

## 1. CRITICAL: Data Integrity Issues

### 1.1 Stats Computation - Duplicate Verdict Map Construction ✓
**File:** [stats.py:98-131](stats.py#L98-L131)
**Severity:** HIGH - Affects published results
**Status:** FIXED

The `main()` function constructs a `critique_verdict_map` twice:
1. Lines 131-151: Full map with metadata (used for statistics)
2. Lines 278-288: Minimal map (used for filtering)

**Problem:** If there's any discrepancy in how these maps are built, statistics will be computed on different data than what's filtered. This is a classic source of subtle bugs in research code.

**Impact:** Could cause incorrect filtering of claims, leading to wrong statistical results.

**Fix Applied:**
- Extracted `build_critique_verdict_map()` function that builds the map once with full metadata
- Both `compute_model_stats()` and `main()` now call this shared function
- Ensures consistency between statistics computation and filtering

**Human decision**: Approve

### 1.2 Cross-Model Stats Missing Self-Answer Critiques ✓
**File:** [stats.py:222-237](stats.py#L222-L237)
**Severity:** MEDIUM - Incomplete statistics
**Status:** FIXED

The code adds "declared correct" answers to cross-model stats but skips self-answers:
```python
if answer_author and question_author and answer_author != question_author:
```

**Problem:** Self-answers that are declared "correct" by critics are never counted anywhere in the statistics. This creates an inconsistency where:
- Self-answers with debates are tracked in `model_self_answers`
- Self-answers declared "correct" (no debate) are invisible

**Impact:** Incomplete view of model performance on self-generated questions.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `model_self_answers_no_debate` dict to track self-answers declared correct
- Updated loop to count self-answers when `answer_author == question_author`
- Added separate output section to print these counts
- Modified `compute_model_stats()` to return this new category

Answer: separate category

## 2. CRITICAL: Statistical Validity Issues

### 2.1 Unsafe Majority Vote Calculation ✓
**File:** [stats.py:200-216](stats.py#L200-L216)
**Severity:** HIGH - Invalid statistics with even number of judges
**Status:** FIXED

```python
majority_correct = correct_count > len(verdicts) / 2
```

**Problem:** With an even number of judges (e.g., 2 judges, 1-1 split), this evaluates to `1 > 1.0 = False`, treating ties as "wrong". This is arbitrary and not mathematically sound.

**Impact:**
- Biases results against defenders in tie situations
- Makes results dependent on having an odd number of judges
- Violates statistical best practices for majority voting

**Fix Applied:**
- Added explicit tie detection: `is_tie = (correct_count == len(verdicts) / 2)`
- Ties are now excluded entirely from analysis (per user decision Q1.2: Answer C)
- Only non-tie cases are counted in cross-model statistics
- Comment added explaining the decision

**Human decision**: Exclude ties from analysis (Answer C)

### 2.2 Division by Zero Risk in Stats ✓
**File:** [stats.py:258-259](stats.py#L258-L259)
**Severity:** MEDIUM - Crash risk
**Status:** FIXED

```python
avg_percentage = sum(percentages) / len(percentages)
```

**Problem:** If `percentages` is empty (model has no data), division by zero will crash.

**Context:** The outer `if not percentages: continue` check at line 255 prevents this, but it's fragile. If someone refactors and moves the code, the protection is lost.

**Fix Applied:**
```python
avg_percentage = sum(percentages) / len(percentages) if percentages else 0.0
```
Added explicit safety check making the code more robust to refactoring.

**Human decision**: approve

## 3. CRITICAL: Parsing and JSON Handling

### 3.1 Inconsistent JSON Extraction
**File:** [generate_critiques.py:79-102](generate_critiques.py#L79-L102)
**Severity:** HIGH - Data loss or misinterpretation

The `extract_structured_critique` function has complex fallback logic:
1. Try to parse as JSON
2. If `notes` is a list, join with "; "
3. If parsing fails, use raw text as notes

**Problem:** This is inconsistent with other parts of the code:
- Some places expect `notes` to be a string
- Some places expect it to be structured data
- The fallback silently changes data format

**Impact:**
- Downstream code may receive unexpected data types
- Statistical analysis may mix structured and unstructured notes
- Debugging is difficult when format is unpredictable

**Fix:** Enforce consistent JSON schema throughout pipeline, with clear error handling when parsing fails.

**Human decision**: approve, use strictness

### 3.2 Missing Validation for Critique Verdicts ✓
**File:** [generate_critiques.py:87-115](generate_critiques.py#L87-L115)
**Severity:** MEDIUM - Invalid data in results
**Status:** FIXED

```python
if isinstance(parsed.get("verdict"), str):
    verdict = parsed["verdict"]
```

**Problem:** No validation that verdict is one of the expected values: `"correct"`, `"incorrect"`, `"insufficient"`, `"obscure"`. Invalid values pass through silently.

**Impact:** Statistics code may encounter unexpected verdicts, leading to miscategorization.

**Fix Applied:**
```python
VALID_CRITIQUE_VERDICTS = {"correct", "incorrect", "insufficient", "obscure"}
parsed_verdict = parsed.get("verdict")
if isinstance(parsed_verdict, str) and parsed_verdict in VALID_CRITIQUE_VERDICTS:
    verdict = parsed_verdict
elif isinstance(parsed_verdict, str):
    logger.warning(f"Invalid critique verdict '{parsed_verdict}', treating as 'unknown'")
    verdict = "unknown"
```
Added validation set and logging for invalid verdicts.

**Human decision**: approve

### 3.3 Confidence Parsing Accepts None ✓
**File:** [automated_judge.py:362-401](automated_judge.py#L362-L401)
**Severity:** MEDIUM - Contradictory validation
**Status:** FIXED

```python
def parse_confidence(raw) -> int:
    if raw is None:
        raise ValueError("Confidence field is required")
```

But then in `parse_judgment` (line 372):
```python
confidence = parse_confidence(parsed.get("confidence"))
```

**Problem:** `.get("confidence")` returns `None` if missing, which will raise "Confidence field is required". However, the exception is not caught, so the entire judgment fails.

**Impact:** Valid judgments with missing confidence fields are rejected entirely, rather than being handled gracefully.

**Fix Applied:**
```python
try:
    confidence = parse_confidence(parsed.get("confidence"))
except ValueError as e:
    logger.warning(f"Failed to parse confidence for task {task.get('id')}: {e}")
    confidence = None
    verdict = "unknown"  # Mark as failed
```
Now catches the exception, logs a warning, and marks the judgment as failed gracefully.

**Human decision**: 2 (catch exception and mark as failed)

## 4. LOGIC BUGS

### 4.1 Self-Improvement Loop Overwrites Raw Answers
**File:** [self_improvement.py:134-139](self_improvement.py#L134-L139)
**Severity:** HIGH - Data loss

```python
for idx, new_answer in zip(refine_indices, refined_answers):
    if idx not in raw_answers_map:
        raw_answers_map[idx] = {}
    raw_answers_map[idx][round_idx + 1] = new_answer
    results[idx].final_answer = new_answer
```

**Problem:** Each refinement stores the *cleaned* answer (after `clean_math`), not the original raw LLM output. But the variable is named `raw_answers_map`.

**Impact:**
- Cannot debug or analyze the actual LLM outputs
- Lose information about what the model originally said
- Math cleaning happens before storage, making it irreversible

**Context:** At line 114 in generate_answers.py: `cleaned_answers = [clean_math(r) for r in raw_answers]` happens before self-improvement, so raw answers are preserved. But refined answers are cleaned in `query_llm_batch` before being stored.

**Fix:** Store truly raw answers before any cleaning, or rename variables to reflect they're cleaned.

**Human decision**: approve

### 4.2 Debate Early Stop Inconsistency
**File:** [debate.py:152-154](debate.py#L152-L154), [debate.py:160-162](debate.py#L160-L162)
**Severity:** LOW - Minor inconsistency

```python
if allow_concede and check_concession(owner_reply):
    break
# ... claimant responds ...
if allow_concede and check_concession(claimant_reply):
    break
```

**Problem:** If owner concedes on round N, the loop breaks immediately. But if claimant concedes on round N, we've already collected both messages for round N. This asymmetry could affect statistical analysis.

**Impact:** Number of rounds in debate history depends on who conceded, which may not be intentional.

**Question for user:** Is this intentional? Should both parties get to respond in the same round, or should we break immediately?

**Human decision**: Keep for now, document in docs/issues.md

### 4.3 Gemini Batch Response Handling Complexity
**File:** [model_api.py:597-634](model_api.py#L597-L634)
**Severity:** MEDIUM - Potential data loss

The Gemini batch response handling has two completely different code paths:
1. Lines 600-620: File-based responses (parses JSONL)
2. Lines 621-632: Inlined responses (uses Python objects)

**Problem:** These paths are mutually exclusive, but there's no clear documentation on when each occurs. If the response format changes, one path could silently fail.

**Impact:**
- Brittle to API changes
- Hard to debug which path was taken
- No logging to track which path is used

**Fix:** Add logging and explicit error messages:
```python
if job.dest and getattr(job.dest, "file_name", None):
    logger.debug("Using file-based Gemini batch response")
    # ... existing code ...
elif job.dest and getattr(job.dest, "inlined_responses", None):
    logger.debug("Using inlined Gemini batch response")
    # ... existing code ...
else:
    raise RuntimeError(f"Gemini batch job has unrecognized destination format: {job.dest}")
```


**Human decision**: approve

## 5. CONCURRENCY AND RACE CONDITIONS

### 5.1 Unsafe Concurrent File Writing
**File:** [generate_answers.py:222-228](generate_answers.py#L222-L228), [generate_critiques.py:363-380](generate_critiques.py#L363-L380)
**Severity:** HIGH - Data corruption risk

Multiple threads write to the same files:
```python
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=max(4, len(answer_models))) as pool:
    # ...
    existing_records = load_json(out, [])  # Thread 1 reads
    # ...
    save_json(out, existing_records)       # Thread 1 writes
```

**Problem:** If two threads process different (answer_model, question_model) pairs that map to the same output file, they can:
1. Both read the same initial state
2. Both modify different indices
3. Both write back, with the second write overwriting the first

**Impact:** Lost data, corrupted files, irreproducible results.

**Example:**
- Thread A processes model1 on question1, updates index 0
- Thread B processes model2 on question1, updates index 1
- Both read `[]`, both write. One write is lost.

**Wait, I need to re-examine this:** Actually, looking at line 196: `out_path = args.output_dir / q_slug / f"{answer_spec.slug}.json"`, each (question, answer) pair writes to a different file. So there's no race condition here.

**Correction:** This is actually safe - each task writes to a unique file path. False alarm.

### 5.2 Actual Race Condition: Critique Generation ✓
**File:** [generate_critiques.py:363-380](generate_critiques.py#L363-L380)
**Severity:** HIGH - Data corruption risk
**Status:** VERIFIED - NO RACE CONDITION

```python
for job, attempts in zip(jobs, attempts_list):
    records = load_json(job["output_path"], [])  # Read
    if len(records) <= job["record_idx"]:
        records.extend([{} for _ in range(job["record_idx"] - len(records) + 1)])
    records[job["record_idx"]] = {...}
    save_json(job["output_path"], records)  # Write
```

**Problem:** Multiple jobs can share the same `output_path` (same file), each updating different indices. Classic read-modify-write race condition.

**Analysis:** After careful review:
- Output path is: `args.output_dir / args.mode / q_slug / f"{critic_slug}__{a_slug}.json"`
- Each (critic, answer_author) pair writes to a UNIQUE file
- Jobs are grouped by critic (`jobs_by_critic`)
- Within each critic's batch, file writes happen serially (in the for loop at line 363)
- Different critics write to different files (because `critic_slug` differs)

**Conclusion:** NO race condition exists. Each thread writes to unique files, and within-file updates are serial.

**Human decision**: Verified no concurrent access to same file

## 6. ERROR HANDLING AND ROBUSTNESS

### 6.1 Silent Failures in Debate Generation
**File:** [debate.py:303-318](debate.py#L303-L318)
**Severity:** MEDIUM - Silent data loss

```python
history = illposed_debate(...)
if len(existing) <= idx:
    existing.extend([{} for _ in range(idx - len(existing) + 1)])
existing[idx] = {...}
save_json(debate_path, existing)
```

**Problem:** If `illposed_debate()` raises an exception, it's not caught here. The exception will propagate, the file won't be saved, but there's no logging or retry mechanism.

**Impact:** Transient API errors can cause data loss without visibility.

**Fix:** Add try-except with logging:
```python
try:
    history = illposed_debate(...)
    # ... save logic ...
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Failed to generate debate for {q_slug}/{answer_model_slug}/{idx}: {e}")
    continue
```

**Human decision**: approve

### 6.2 Missing Validation in check_issues.py ✓
**File:** [check_issues.py:105-112](check_issues.py#L105-L112)
**Severity:** LOW - Incomplete validation
**Status:** FIXED

```python
if verdict and verdict not in ["pass", "fail", "correct", "incorrect"]:
    issues["invalid_verdict"] += 1
```

**Problem:** This only checks critique file verdicts, but the actual valid verdicts for critiques are: `"correct"`, `"incorrect"`, `"insufficient"`, `"obscure"` (from prompt_library.py:178). Also "pass" and "fail" are not valid critique verdicts.

**Impact:** "insufficient" and "obscure" verdicts are flagged as invalid when they're actually valid.

**Fix Applied:**
```python
# Valid critique verdicts: "correct", "incorrect", "insufficient", "obscure", "unknown"
valid_critique_verdicts = {"correct", "incorrect", "insufficient", "obscure", "unknown"}
if verdict and verdict not in valid_critique_verdicts:
    issues["invalid_verdict"] += 1
```
Updated to match the actual valid verdict taxonomy.

**Human decision**: approve

### 6.3 No Validation for Model Existence in Stats
**File:** [stats.py:313-314](stats.py#L313-L314)
**Severity:** LOW - Potential KeyError

```python
model_self_answers, model_defender, model_claimant, cross_model_stats = compute_model_stats(...)
print_agreement_stats(model_self_answers, ...)
```

**Problem:** If a model name in the data doesn't exist in the registry, stats will be computed with arbitrary model names. No validation that model names are consistent across pipeline stages.

**Impact:** Typos or renamed models will create separate entries in stats, fragmenting results.

**Fix:** Validate model names against registry before computing stats.


**Human decision**: approve
---

## 7. INEFFICIENCIES

### 7.1 Redundant File Reads in Debate Generation
**File:** [debate.py:281-292](debate.py#L281-L292), [debate.py:303-318](debate.py#L303-L318)
**Severity:** LOW - Performance

The code loops over benchmark files, then for each file:
1. Reads answer file (line 258)
2. Loads existing debates (line 269)
3. Loops over records
4. For each record, loads existing debates again (line 300): `existing = load_json(debate_path, [])`

**Problem:** Line 300 re-reads the same file loaded at line 269 in every iteration of the loop.

**Impact:** O(n²) file reads where n is number of questions.

**Fix:** Reuse `existing` from outer scope instead of reloading.


**Human decision**: approve

### 7.2 Inefficient Claim ID Collection
**File:** [stats.py:36-51](stats.py#L36-L51)
**Severity:** LOW - Performance

```python
def collect_claim_ids(critiques_dir: Path, debates_dir: Path):
    claim_ids = set()
    for mode_dir in critiques_dir.glob("*"):
        for q_dir in mode_dir.glob("*"):
            for crit_file in q_dir.glob("*.json"):
                q_slug = q_dir.name
                crit_ids = load_json(crit_file, [])
                for idx, _ in enumerate(crit_ids):
                    claim_ids.add(f"critique/{mode_dir.name}/{q_slug}/{crit_file.stem}/{idx}")
```

**Problem:** Loads entire JSON files just to count entries (`enumerate(crit_ids)`). For large files, this is wasteful.

**Impact:** High memory usage and slow startup for stats.

**Fix:** This is probably fine for research code with moderate data sizes. Optimization not critical unless dataset grows significantly.


**Human decision**: ok

## 8. CONFIGURATION AND SETUP ISSUES

### 8.1 Temperature Validation Inconsistency ✓
**File:** [model_api.py:165-166](model_api.py#L165-L166), [model_api.py:661-662](model_api.py#L661-L662)
**Severity:** MEDIUM - Confusing error messages
**Status:** FIXED

```python
if 'anthropic' in model and (temperature is not None and temperature != 1) and reasoning is not None:
    raise ValueError("Cannot set both temperature and reasoning in Anthropic requests")
```

**Problem:** The check is `temperature != 1`, which means temperature=1 is allowed. But the error message says "Cannot set both", implying ANY temperature is invalid with reasoning.

**Impact:** Unclear API contract, users may be confused about valid combinations.

**Fix Applied:**
```python
if 'anthropic' in model and temperature is not None and reasoning is not None:
    raise ValueError("Cannot set both temperature and reasoning in Anthropic requests")
```
Now raises error for ANY non-None temperature value with reasoning, making the contract clear.

**Human decision**: raise the error when the temperature is not None, even if temperature=1

### 8.2 Parsing Config Uses Nonexistent Model ✓
**File:** [configs/parsing.json:2](configs/parsing.json#L2)
**Severity:** CRITICAL - Parsing will fail
**Status:** FIXED

```json
{
  "model": "openai/gpt-5.2",
  "temperature": null
}
```

**Problem:** There is no `openai/gpt-5.2` in the registry. The registry has `openai/gpt-5.2-2025-12-11`. JSON repair will fail when needed.

**Impact:** Any malformed JSON will cause silent failures, as `_repair_with_model` will return None instead of attempting repair.

**Fix Applied:**
```json
{
  "model": "openai/gpt-5.2-2025-12-11",
  "temperature": 0
}
```

**Human decision**: approve

### 8.3 Inconsistent Temperature Defaults ✓
**File:** [model_api.py:146](model_api.py#L146), [model_api.py:203](model_api.py#L203), [model_api.py:640](model_api.py#L640)
**Severity:** LOW - Inconsistent behavior
**Status:** FIXED

```python
def query_llm(..., temperature: Optional[float] = 1, ...):
```

But in models.json:
```json
"default_temperature": 0,
```

**Problem:** Function default is 1.0, but config default is 0. Models with `"temperature": null` will use config's 0, but direct API calls will use 1.

**Impact:** Inconsistent behavior between scripted and interactive usage.

**Fix Applied:**
Changed all three functions (`query_llm`, `query_llm_single`, `query_llm_batch`) to use `temperature: Optional[float] = None` as the default parameter.

**Human decision**: make the default null/None everywhere

---

## 9. DOCUMENTATION AND CODE CLARITY

### 9.1 Confusing Variable Names
**File:** [stats.py:119-120](stats.py#L119-L120)
**Severity:** LOW - Readability

```python
# Verdicts that side with claimant: claimant_wins, mixed (partial win)
model_claimant = defaultdict(list)
```

**Problem:** "model_claimant" is ambiguous - does it mean "model acting as claimant" or "claimant model's performance"?

**Impact:** Hard to understand what the data structure represents.

**Suggestion:** Rename to `claimant_success_rate` or `model_as_claimant_stats`.


**Human decision**: approve

### 9.2 Magic String Verdicts Throughout ✓
**File:** Multiple files
**Severity:** MEDIUM - Maintenance burden
**Status:** FIXED

Verdict strings like `"defender_wins_incorrect"`, `"claimant_wins"`, etc. are hardcoded as string literals in many places:
- [stats.py:178](stats.py#L178)
- [stats.py:194](stats.py#L194)
- [automated_judge.py:328](automated_judge.py#L328)
- [check_issues.py:181-196](check_issues.py#L181-L196)

**Problem:**
- No single source of truth
- Easy to introduce typos
- Hard to refactor if verdict taxonomy changes
- Inconsistent validation across files

**Fix Applied:**
Created [constants.py](constants.py) with verdict constants:
```python
# Critique verdicts
CRITIQUE_VERDICT_CORRECT = "correct"
CRITIQUE_VERDICT_INCORRECT = "incorrect"
CRITIQUE_VERDICT_INSUFFICIENT = "insufficient"
CRITIQUE_VERDICT_OBSCURE = "obscure"
CRITIQUE_VERDICT_UNKNOWN = "unknown"

VALID_CRITIQUE_VERDICTS = {
    CRITIQUE_VERDICT_CORRECT,
    CRITIQUE_VERDICT_INCORRECT,
    CRITIQUE_VERDICT_INSUFFICIENT,
    CRITIQUE_VERDICT_OBSCURE,
    CRITIQUE_VERDICT_UNKNOWN,
}

# Judge verdicts
JUDGE_VERDICT_CLAIMANT_WINS = "claimant_wins"
JUDGE_VERDICT_DEFENDER_WINS_INCORRECT = "defender_wins_incorrect"
JUDGE_VERDICT_DEFENDER_WINS_MINOR = "defender_wins_minor"
JUDGE_VERDICT_WRONG_PROBLEM = "wrong_problem"
JUDGE_VERDICT_MIXED = "mixed"
JUDGE_VERDICT_UNKNOWN = "unknown"

VALID_CRITIQUE_DEBATE_VERDICTS = {
    JUDGE_VERDICT_CLAIMANT_WINS,
    JUDGE_VERDICT_DEFENDER_WINS_INCORRECT,
    JUDGE_VERDICT_DEFENDER_WINS_MINOR,
    JUDGE_VERDICT_WRONG_PROBLEM,
    JUDGE_VERDICT_MIXED,
    JUDGE_VERDICT_UNKNOWN,
}

VALID_ILLPOSED_DEBATE_VERDICTS = {
    JUDGE_VERDICT_CLAIMANT_WINS,
    JUDGE_VERDICT_DEFENDER_WINS_INCORRECT,
    JUDGE_VERDICT_WRONG_PROBLEM,
    JUDGE_VERDICT_MIXED,
    JUDGE_VERDICT_UNKNOWN,
}

DEFENDER_WIN_VERDICTS = {
    JUDGE_VERDICT_DEFENDER_WINS_INCORRECT,
    JUDGE_VERDICT_DEFENDER_WINS_MINOR,
}

# Status values
STATUS_SUCCEEDED = "succeeded"
STATUS_FAILED = "failed"
STATUS_ILL_POSED = "ill-posed"

VALID_STATUSES = {
    STATUS_SUCCEEDED,
    STATUS_FAILED,
    STATUS_ILL_POSED,
}
```

**Note:** Files will need to import from constants.py to use these values. This is a foundation for future refactoring.


**Human decision**: approve

## 10. POTENTIAL DATA QUALITY ISSUES

### 10.1 No Validation of Debate Transcript Format
**File:** [automated_judge.py:101-114](automated_judge.py#L101-L114)
**Severity:** MEDIUM - Garbage in, garbage out

```python
def format_debate(history: List[Dict], redactions: Iterable[Tuple[str, str]], speaker_map: Dict[str, str]) -> str:
    if not history:
        return "(No debate transcript available.)"
    lines = []
    for msg in history:
        speaker = msg.get("speaker") or "Speaker"
        message = redact_text(msg.get("message", ""), redactions)
```

**Problem:** No validation that:
- `history` is actually a list
- `msg` is a dict
- Required fields exist
- Messages are non-empty

**Impact:** Malformed debate data will produce garbage prompts sent to judge models, leading to invalid judgments.

**Fix:** Add validation:
```python
def format_debate(history: List[Dict], ...) -> str:
    if not history:
        return "(No debate transcript available.)"
    if not isinstance(history, list):
        logger.warning(f"Invalid debate history format: {type(history)}")
        return "(Invalid debate transcript format.)"
    lines = []
    for msg in history:
        if not isinstance(msg, dict):
            logger.warning(f"Invalid debate message format: {type(msg)}")
            continue
        # ... rest of code
```

### 10.2 Redaction May Over-Redact
**File:** [automated_judge.py:90-98](automated_judge.py#L90-L98)
**Severity:** LOW - Potential information loss

```python
def redact_text(text: str, redactions: Iterable[Tuple[str, str]]) -> str:
    if not text:
        return ""
    redacted = text
    for needle, replacement in redactions:
        if not needle:
            continue
        redacted = re.sub(re.escape(needle), replacement, redacted, flags=re.IGNORECASE)
    return redacted
```

**Problem:** Uses `re.IGNORECASE`, which may redact unintended substrings.

**Example:** If model name is "claude", this will redact "Claude" in "Claude's theorem" even though that's a person's name, not the model.

**Impact:** Judge prompts may have over-redacted text, losing important context.

**Fix:** Use word boundaries:
```python
redacted = re.sub(r'\b' + re.escape(needle) + r'\b', replacement, redacted, flags=re.IGNORECASE)
```

But this may break if needle contains special characters. Better: exact case-sensitive matching for model names.

## 11. TESTING AND REPRODUCIBILITY

### 11.1 No Reproducibility for Random Selection
**File:** Multiple files use ThreadPoolExecutor
**Severity:** MEDIUM - Non-reproducible results

**Problem:** No random seeds are set anywhere. Thread execution order is non-deterministic.

**Impact:** Results may vary slightly between runs due to:
- Thread scheduling affecting API call order
- Different models seeing different states of concurrent updates
- Race conditions manifesting differently

**Fix:**
1. Set random seeds at program start
2. Add run IDs and timestamps to all output files
3. Log execution order for debugging

**Human decision**: ignore, document in issues.md

### 11.2 No Schema Validation
**File:** All JSON I/O
**Severity:** MEDIUM - Silent data corruption

**Problem:** No schema validation for any JSON files. Malformed data is accepted silently.

**Impact:** Pipeline can run successfully on corrupted data, producing invalid results.

**Fix:** Use JSON Schema or Pydantic for validation at pipeline boundaries.


**Human decision**: approve, create data_models.py

## 12. RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

### 12.1 Unclosed File Handles in Error Cases
**File:** [model_api.py:440-498](model_api.py#L440-L498)
**Severity:** LOW - Resource leak

```python
try:
    with open(batch_file_path, "rb") as file_handle:
        files = {"file": (os.path.basename(batch_file_path), file_handle)}
        upload_resp = session.post(OPENAI_FILES_URL, headers=headers_auth, files=files, data=data)
    # ...
finally:
    if os.path.exists(batch_file_path):
        os.remove(batch_file_path)
```

**Problem:** If an exception occurs between file creation and the finally block, the temp file may not be cleaned up.

**Actually, looking closer:** The `finally` block does clean up. This is correct.

**Retraction:** False alarm, this is handled correctly.

### 12.2 Global HTTP Session Never Closed ✓
**File:** [model_api.py:15-33](model_api.py#L15-L33)
**Severity:** LOW - Minor resource leak
**Status:** FIXED

```python
_http_session = None

def get_http_session() -> requests.Session:
    global _http_session
    if _http_session is None:
        _http_session = requests.Session()
    return _http_session
```

**Problem:** The session is created but never closed when the program exits.

**Impact:** Connection pool may not be cleaned up properly, though Python will close it on exit.

**Fix Applied:**
```python
import atexit

def get_http_session() -> requests.Session:
    global _http_session
    if _http_session is None:
        _http_session = requests.Session()
    return _http_session

def _cleanup_http_session():
    """Close the global HTTP session on program exit."""
    global _http_session
    if _http_session is not None:
        _http_session.close()
        _http_session = None

# Register cleanup handler to close session on exit
atexit.register(_cleanup_http_session)
```
Added atexit handler for proper resource cleanup.
