The dimension argument is wrong because a prime containing (xz,yz) need not contain (x,y); e.g. primes containing (z) also contain (xz,yz), and since (xz,yz) has minimal primes (z) and (x,y), we get dim R = max{dim S/(z), dim S/(x,y)} = max{2,1} = 2. The depth claim \u201cx,y,z is a regular sequence\u201d is false since xz=0 and yz=0 make x,y (and also z) zero divisors; moreover a nonzerodivisor exists (e.g. x+z) giving depth \u2265 1, and modding out by it yields k[y,z]/(z^2,yz) of depth 0, so depth(R_m)=1.
