Bob concedes that there is a fatal substitution error in Step 3, where $g(x^2-y^2)$ should evaluate to $h((x^2-y^2)^2)$, not $h(x^2-y^2)$. This invalidates the functional equation derived for $h$. Additionally, the argument claiming that $h$ must be constant due to rigidity is unjustified and lacks rigor. These issues substantiate Alice's critique that the proof does not establish the conclusion that $f(x) = cx$ is the only solution.\"\n}\n```",
