Bob concedes that the Euler-Lagrange equation implies a constant or piecewise constant slope, contradicting the conclusion of a circular arc. Additionally, Alice points out the non-existence of a smooth solution under the given constraints, which Bob acknowledges. The arithmetic error regarding the arc length further confirms the solution's incorrectness. Bob's concessions and the identified errors substantiate Alice's critique.\"\n}\n```",
