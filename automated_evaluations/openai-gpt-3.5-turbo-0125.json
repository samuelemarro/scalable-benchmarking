The derivation of $\\pi_2 = \\frac{11}{9}\\pi_1$ from the given equations is valid, demonstrating the correctness of the algebraic steps. Therefore, Alice's critique of computational errors in part (a) is unfounded. The solution for part (b) was already acknowledged as correct, further supporting the defense.\"\n}",
