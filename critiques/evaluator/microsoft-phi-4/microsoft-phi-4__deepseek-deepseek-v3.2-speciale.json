        "notes": "The answer correctly applies the triangle inequality to show that for any $f \\in L^1(\\mathbb{R})$ and any $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $|\\mathcal{F}(f)(\\xi)| \\leq \\|f\\|_1$. This is a valid application of the properties of the Lebesgue integral and the modulus of the complex exponential. The conclusion that $\\|\\mathcal{F}(f)\\|_\\infty \\leq \\|f\\|_1$ follows logically from taking the supremum over $\\xi$.
