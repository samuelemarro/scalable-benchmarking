The Cantor-Lebesgue function is a continuous function that increases from 0 to $1/2$ on $[0, 1/3]$ and from $1/2$ to 1 on $[2/3, 1]$; it is not piecewise constant on these intervals. The reasoning 'This implies that $f(x) = \\frac{1}{2}f(3x) = \\dots = \\frac{1}{4}f(x)$' is logically flawed because it assumes $f(3x) = \\frac{1}{2}f(x)$, whereas the property states $f(x) = \\frac{1}{2}f(3x)$ (so $f(3x) = 2f(x)$).
