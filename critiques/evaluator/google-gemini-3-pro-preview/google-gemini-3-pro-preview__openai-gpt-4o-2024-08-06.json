        "notes": "The answer contains fundamental mathematical errors. First, it incorrectly claims that non-zero periodic sequences belong to $\\ell^2(\\mathbb{N})$. A non-zero periodic sequence $(x_n)$ does not satisfy $\\sum |x_n|^2 < \\infty$, so it cannot be an eigenvector in this Hilbert space. Second, there are arithmetic errors in the recurrence calculation for $\\lambda = 1$. For example, with $x_1=1$ and $x_2=3$, the term $x_3$ is calculated correctly as $-1$, but $x_4$ should be $2x_3 - x_2 = 2(-1) - 3 = -5$, whereas the answer claims $x_4 = -3$. The actual sequence exhibits linear growth, further confirming it is not in $\\ell^2(\\mathbb{N})$. Similar issues apply to the $\\lambda = -1$ case.",
        "suggestions": "Review the definition of $\\ell^2(\\mathbb{N})$; sequences must decay to zero to be square-summable. Re-calculate the recurrence terms carefully. To find the point spectrum, look for $\\lambda$ values where the resulting sequence decays exponentially (which typically requires $\\lambda$ to be outside the essential spectrum bands and the boundary condition to align with the stable manifold of the transfer matrix).",
