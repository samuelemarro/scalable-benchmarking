Assume $\\alpha$ is non-zero and falls within the convergence range found in Part 1. Determine the optimal relaxation parameter $\\omega_{\\text{opt}}$ for the **Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR)** method as a function of $\\alpha$. Then, find the spectral radius of the SOR iteration matrix at this optimal parameter, $\\rho(\\mathcal{L}_{\\omega_{\\text{opt}}})$, simplifying your answer.",
