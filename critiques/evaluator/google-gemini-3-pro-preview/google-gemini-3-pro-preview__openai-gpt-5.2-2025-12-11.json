Let $\\mu_L$ be the left Haar measure on $G$, which can be written in the form $d\\mu_L(a,b) = w(a,b) \\, da \\, db$ where $da \\, db$ is the standard Lebesgue measure on $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nConsider the function $f: G \\to \\mathbb{R}$ defined as the characteristic function of the subset $S$:\n$$ S = \\left\\{ (a, b) \\in G \\;\\middle|\\; \\frac{1}{2} \\le a \\le 2, \\; -1 \\le b \\le 1 \\right\\}. $$\nThat is, $f(g) = 1$ if $g \\in S$ and $f(g) = 0$ otherwise.\n\n1. Determine the weight function $w(a,b)$ for the left Haar measure on $G$.\n2. Compute the exact value of the convolution $(f * f)(e)$ at the identity element $e = (1, 0)$. The convolution is defined by:\n   $$ (f * f)(e) = \\int_G f(g) f(g^{-1}) \\, d\\mu_L(g). $$",
