    "question": "Let $n \\geq 2$ be an integer. Consider the system of linear equations $Ax = b$, where $A$ is an $n \\times n$ tridiagonal matrix with constant diagonals, defined by:\n$$ A = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & \\alpha & 0 & \\cdots & 0 \\\\ \\alpha & 2 & \\alpha & \\cdots & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\alpha & 2 & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\ddots & \\alpha \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\cdots & \\alpha & 2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nwhere $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is a real parameter.\n\n1. Determine the exact set of values for $\\alpha$ (expressed in terms of $n$) such that the **Jacobi iterative method** converges for any initial guess $x^{(0)}$.\n2. Let $n=3$. Assume $\\alpha$ is non-zero and falls within the convergence range found in Part 1. Determine the optimal relaxation parameter $\\omega_{\\text{opt}}$ for the **Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR)** method as a function of $\\alpha$. Then, find the spectral radius of the SOR iteration matrix at this optimal parameter, $\\rho(\\mathcal{L}_{\\omega_{\\text{opt}}})$, simplifying your answer.",
