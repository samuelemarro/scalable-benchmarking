For the case $a=1, b=1$, the random walk must stop at $n=1$ (since $S_1 = 1 = a$ or $S_1 = -1 = -b$), so $\\tau=1$ deterministically and $\\text{Var}(\\tau)=0$. The provided formula $\\frac{ab(a^2+ab+b^2)}{3}$ yields $\\frac{1(3)}{3}=1$, which is wrong. Additionally, the solution exhibits inconsistency, stating one formula in Step 7 ($a^2+b^2-ab$) and a different one in Step 9 ($a^2+ab+b^2$), neither of which is the correct formula for the discrete random walk, which is $\\frac{ab(a^2+b^2-2)}{3}$.",
