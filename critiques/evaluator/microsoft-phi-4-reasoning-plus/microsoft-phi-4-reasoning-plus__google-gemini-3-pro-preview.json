    "question": "Consider a set $S$ of real-valued functions defined on the interval $[0, 1]$. Define a relation $\\sim$ on $S$ by $f \\sim g$ if and only if there exists a constant $C$ such that for all $x \\in [0, 1]$, $|f(x) - g(x)| \\leq C \\cdot |x - 0.5|$. \n\n1. Prove that $\\sim$ is an equivalence relation on $S$.\n2. Determine the equivalence class of the function $f(x) = x$ under this relation.\n3. Show that the set of equivalence classes forms a vector space over the reals. Identify a basis for this vector space.",
