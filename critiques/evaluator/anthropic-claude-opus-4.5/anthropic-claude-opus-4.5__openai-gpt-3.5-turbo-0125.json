The correct approach using Watson's lemma is to expand $\\frac{1}{1+t^4} = 1 - t^4 + O(t^8)$ near $t=0$ and integrate term-by-term: $$I(x) \\sim \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-xt^2}\\,dt - \\int_0^{\\infty} t^4 e^{-xt^2}\\,dt + \\cdots$$ The first integral equals $\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{x}}$ and the second equals $\\frac{3\\sqrt{\\pi}}{8x^{5/2}}$. The correct asymptotic expansion is: $$I(x) \\sim \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{x}} - \\frac{3\\sqrt{\\pi}}{8x^{5/2}}$$ The answer's final expression $\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{x^{3/2}}} + \\frac{3}{2}x^{-1/2}$ has incorrect powers of $x$ and the second term incorrectly lacks the factor $\\sqrt{\\pi}$.",
