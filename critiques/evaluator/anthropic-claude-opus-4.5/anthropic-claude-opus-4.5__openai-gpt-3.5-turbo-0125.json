The claim that '$0 \\to R \\xrightarrow{\\varepsilon} \\mathbb{Z} \\to 0$' is a projective resolution is false because $\\ker(\\varepsilon) = xR \\neq 0$. The kernel of $\\varepsilon: R \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ consists of elements $bx$ for $b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, which is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$ as an abelian group. The correct projective resolution is infinite: $\\cdots \\xrightarrow{\\cdot x} R \\xrightarrow{\\cdot x} R \\xrightarrow{\\varepsilon} \\mathbb{Z} \\to 0$, where each map (except the last) is multiplication by $x$, and each kernel is $xR$. Applying $\\mathrm{Hom}_R(-, \\mathbb{Z})$ yields the complex $0 \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{0} \\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{0} \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\cdots$ (all differentials are zero because $\\phi(x) = x \\cdot \\phi(1) = 0$ for any $\\phi \\in \\mathrm{Hom}_R(R, \\mathbb{Z})$). The cohomology of this complex gives $\\mathrm{Ext}^n_R(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$ for all $n \\geq 0$, not $0$ for $n > 0$ as claimed.",
