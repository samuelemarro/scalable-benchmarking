        "notes": "The answer incorrectly claims $K \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Q}} K \\cong \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha) \\times \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha\\omega) \\times \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha\\omega^2)$, three degree-3 fields. This is wrong. The correct analysis uses $K \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Q}} K \\cong K[x]/(x^3-2)$. Over $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$ where $\\alpha = \\sqrt[3]{2}$, we have $x^3 - 2 = (x-\\alpha)(x^2 + \\alpha x + \\alpha^2)$. The quadratic $x^2 + \\alpha x + \\alpha^2$ has discriminant $-3\\alpha^2$, and since $K \\subset \\mathbb{R}$, we have $\\sqrt{-3} \\notin K$, so this quadratic is irreducible over $K$. By CRT: $K \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Q}} K \\cong K \\times K[x]/(x^2+\\alpha x+\\alpha^2) \\cong \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[3]{2}) \\times \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[3]{2}, \\omega)$, where the first factor has degree 3 and the second factor (the splitting field) has degree 6 over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The answer's error stems from incorrectly assuming the polynomial $x^3-2$ splits into three linear factors over $K$, which only happens over the splitting field, not over $K$ itself.",
