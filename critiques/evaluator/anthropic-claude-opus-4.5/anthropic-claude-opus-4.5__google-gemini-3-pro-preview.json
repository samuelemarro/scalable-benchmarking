The depth computation is rigorous: the answer correctly identifies $x-z$ as a non-zero-divisor (by showing it lies in neither associated prime), then correctly computes that $R/(x-z) \\cong k[x,y]/(x^2, xy)$ has depth 0 (since $x \\neq 0$ but is annihilated by every element of the maximal ideal). The conclusion $\\text{depth}(R) = 1$ follows from the standard formula for regular elements. The alternative verification via the short exact sequence and local cohomology is also correct.
