The function $u$ is harmonic because it can be expressed as the real part of a holomorphic function, specifically $-\\log(1 - z\\bar{z})$. The second part of the question is correctly addressed: $u$ cannot be extended to a harmonic function on the closed unit disk $\\overline{D}$ because it diverges as $|z| \\to 1$.",
