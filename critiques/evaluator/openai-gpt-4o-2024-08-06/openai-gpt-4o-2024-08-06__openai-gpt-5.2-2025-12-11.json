        "notes": "The answer correctly applies the concept of absolute continuity of the Lebesgue integral to show that for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a partition of $[0, 1]$ such that the integral over each subinterval is less than $\\epsilon$ in absolute value. The proof is rigorous and complete, using the dominated convergence theorem to handle the integrals over sets where $|f(x)|$ is large, and then applying this to intervals to construct the desired partition.
