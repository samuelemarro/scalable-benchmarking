        "notes": "The answer correctly applies the lemma of absolute continuity of the Lebesgue integral to show that for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a partition of $[0, 1]$ such that the absolute value of the integral over each subinterval is less than $\\epsilon$. The proof is rigorous and complete, and it correctly identifies that the condition $\\int_0^1 f(x) \\, dx = 0$ is not necessary for the conclusion.",
