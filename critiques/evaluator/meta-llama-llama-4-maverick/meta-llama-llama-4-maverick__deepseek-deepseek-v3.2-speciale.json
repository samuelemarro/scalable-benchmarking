    "question": "## Step 1: Understand the task\nThe task is to generate a challenging but solvable mathematics problem in the domain of Combinatorics, along with a complete and verifiable solution. The problem must be well-posed, clear, non-trivial, and solvable with established mathematical methods.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the domain\nThe domain specified is Combinatorics, which involves the study of counting, arranging, and optimizing objects in various ways. It encompasses topics such as permutations, combinations, graph theory, and more.\n\n## Step 3: Generate a problem\nTo create a challenging problem, let's consider a topic within Combinatorics that is both interesting and requires substantial reasoning. A potential topic is graph theory, specifically focusing on graph coloring or connectivity.\n\n## Step 4: Formulate the problem\nLet's formulate a problem: \"Prove that in any simple graph with $n$ vertices, if the graph is connected and has no cycles (i.e., it's a tree), then it has exactly $n-1$ edges.\"\n\n## Step 5: Verify the problem against the quality rubric\n- **Well-Posedness and Completeness**: The problem is self-contained, defines the necessary terms (simple graph, connected, no cycles, tree), and asks for a proof.\n- **Clarity**: The terms used are standard in graph theory, and the task is clear.\n- **Non-Triviality**: The problem requires understanding of graph theory and a proof involving induction or another suitable method, making it non-trivial.\n- **Solvability and Verification**: The statement is a known fact in graph theory and can be proven using established methods.\n\n## Step 6: Provide the solution\nTo solve this, we can use induction on $n$. For $n=1$, a tree has 0 edges, and $1-1=0$, so the statement holds. For $n>1$, assume the statement is true for all trees with fewer than $n$ vertices. A tree with $n$ vertices has at least one leaf (a vertex of degree 1); removing this leaf and its edge gives a tree with $n-1$ vertices. By the induction hypothesis, this smaller tree has $(n-1)-1 = n-2$ edges. Adding back the removed edge gives $n-2 + 1 = n-1$ edges, proving the statement for $n$.\n\n## Step 7: Format the output\nLet's format the problem and solution according to the required structure.\n\n\nLet $G$ be a simple graph with $n$ vertices. Prove that if $G$ is a tree (i.e., it is connected and has no cycles), then it has exactly $n-1$ edges.",

The problem must be well-posed, clear, non-trivial, and solvable with established mathematical methods.\n\n## Step 2: Identify a suitable topic within number theory.\nNumber theory encompasses various topics such as divisibility, prime numbers, congruences, and Diophantine equations. A challenging problem could involve proving a property related to prime numbers or solving a specific type of Diophantine equation.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a problem that meets the criteria.\nLet's consider a problem involving the sum of divisors of a number and its relation to perfect numbers. A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors, excluding the number itself.\n\n## Step 4: Specify the problem.\nConsider the following problem: \"Prove that if $n$ is an even perfect number, then $n = 2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$, where $2^p - 1$ is a Mersenne prime.\"\n\n## Step 5: Provide the solution to the problem.\nTo solve this, we need to understand the definition of an even perfect number and its relation to Mersenne primes.\n\n## Step 6: Recall the definition and properties of even perfect numbers.\nAn even perfect number $n$ can be written as $n = 2^{k-1}(2^k - 1)$, where $2^k - 1$ is prime. This is known as the Euclid-Euler theorem.\n\n## Step 7: State the Euclid-Euler theorem.\nThe Euclid-Euler theorem states that every even perfect number is of the form $2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$, where $2^p - 1$ is a Mersenne prime (i.e., $2^p - 1$ is prime).\n\n## Step 8: Provide the proof or reasoning for the given statement.\nThe proof involves two main parts: (1) showing that any number of the form $2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$, where $2^p - 1$ is prime, is perfect, and (2) showing that every even perfect number is of this form.\n\n## Step 9: Outline the proof that $2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$ is perfect when $2^p - 1$ is prime.\nLet $n = 2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$. The sum of divisors of $n$, $\\sigma(n)$, is given by $\\sigma(n) = \\sigma(2^{p-1})\\sigma(2^p - 1)$. Since $2^p - 1$ is prime, $\\sigma(2^p - 1) = 2^p$. Also, $\\sigma(2^{p-1}) = 1 + 2 + 2^2 + \\cdots + 2^{p-1} = 2^p - 1$. Thus, $\\sigma(n) = (2^p - 1) \\cdot 2^p = 2 \\cdot 2^{p-1}(2^p - 1) = 2n$, proving $n$ is perfect.\n\n## Step 10: Outline the proof that every even perfect number is of the form $2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$.\nLet $n$ be an even perfect number. Then $n = 2^k \\cdot m$, where $m$ is odd. Since $n$ is perfect, $\\sigma(n) = 2n$. Using the multiplicative property of $\\sigma$, we have $\\sigma(n) = \\sigma(2^k)\\sigma(m) = (2^{k+1} - 1)\\sigma(m)$. Thus, $(2^{k+1} - 1)\\sigma(m) = 2^{k+1}m$. This implies $2^{k+1} - 1$ divides $m$, so $m = (2^{k+1} - 1)d$ for some $d$. Substituting back gives $\\sigma(m) = 2^{k+1}d$. For $d = 1$, $m = 2^{k+1} - 1$ is prime, and $\\sigma(m) = m + 1 = 2^{k+1}$, which matches our requirement. For $d > 1$, it leads to a contradiction because $\\sigma(m) \\geq m + d > 2d$, unless $d = 1$ and $m$ is prime.\n\n## Step 11: Conclude the solution.\nThe given statement is a direct consequence of the Euclid-Euler theorem, which characterizes even perfect numbers.\n\nThe final answer is: \n\nProve that if $n$ is an even perfect number, then $n = 2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$, where $2^p - 1$ is a Mersenne prime.",
