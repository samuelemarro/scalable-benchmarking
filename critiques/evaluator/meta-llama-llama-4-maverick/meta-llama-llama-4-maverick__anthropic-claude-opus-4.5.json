The problem must be well-posed, clear, non-trivial, and solvable with established mathematical methods.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the domain\nThe domain specified is Combinatorics, which involves the study of counting, arranging, and optimizing objects in various ways. It encompasses topics such as permutations, combinations, graph theory, and more.\n\n## Step 3: Generate a problem\nTo create a challenging problem, let's consider a topic within Combinatorics that is both interesting and requires substantial reasoning. A potential topic is graph theory, specifically focusing on graph coloring or connectivity.\n\n## Step 4: Formulate the problem\nLet's formulate a problem: \"Prove that in any simple graph with $n$ vertices, if the graph is connected and has no cycles (i.e., it's a tree), then it has exactly $n-1$ edges.\"\n\n## Step 5: Verify the problem against the quality rubric\n- **Well-Posedness and Completeness**: The problem is self-contained, defines the necessary terms (simple graph, connected, no cycles, tree), and asks for a proof.\n- **Clarity**: The terms used are standard in graph theory, and the task is clear.\n- **Non-Triviality**: The problem requires understanding of graph theory and a proof involving induction or another suitable method, making it non-trivial.\n- **Solvability and Verification**: The statement is a known fact in graph theory and can be proven using established methods.\n\n## Step 6: Provide the solution\nTo solve this, we can use induction on $n$. For $n=1$, a tree has 0 edges, and $1-1=0$, so the statement holds. For $n>1$, assume the statement is true for all trees with fewer than $n$ vertices. A tree with $n$ vertices has at least one leaf (a vertex of degree 1); removing this leaf and its edge gives a tree with $n-1$ vertices. By the induction hypothesis, this smaller tree has $(n-1)-1 = n-2$ edges. Adding back the removed edge gives $n-2 + 1 = n-1$ edges, proving the statement for $n$.\n\n## Step 7: Format the output\nLet's format the problem and solution according to the required structure.\n\n\nLet $G$ be a simple graph with $n$ vertices. Prove that if $G$ is a tree (i.e., it is connected and has no cycles), then it has exactly $n-1$ edges.",

The problem must be well-posed, clear, non-trivial, and solvable with established mathematical methods.\n\n## Step 2: Identify a suitable topic within number theory.\nNumber theory encompasses various topics such as divisibility, prime numbers, congruences, and Diophantine equations. A challenging problem could involve proving a property related to prime numbers or solving a specific type of Diophantine equation.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a problem that meets the criteria.\nLet's consider a problem involving the sum of divisors of a number and its relation to perfect numbers. A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors, excluding the number itself.\n\n## Step 4: Specify the problem.\nConsider the following problem: \"Prove that if $n$ is an even perfect number, then $n = 2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$, where $2^p - 1$ is a Mersenne prime.\"\n\n## Step 5: Provide the solution to the problem.\nTo solve this, we need to understand the definition of an even perfect number and its relation to Mersenne primes.\n\n## Step 6: Recall the definition and properties of even perfect numbers.\nAn even perfect number $n$ can be written as $n = 2^{k-1}(2^k - 1)$, where $2^k - 1$ is prime. This is known as the Euclid-Euler theorem.\n\n## Step 7: State the Euclid-Euler theorem.\nThe Euclid-Euler theorem states that every even perfect number is of the form $2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$, where $2^p - 1$ is a Mersenne prime (i.e., $2^p - 1$ is prime).\n\n## Step 8: Provide the proof or reasoning for the given statement.\nThe proof involves two main parts: (1) showing that any number of the form $2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$, where $2^p - 1$ is prime, is perfect, and (2) showing that every even perfect number is of this form.\n\n## Step 9: Outline the proof that $2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$ is perfect when $2^p - 1$ is prime.\nLet $n = 2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$. The sum of divisors of $n$, $\\sigma(n)$, is given by $\\sigma(n) = \\sigma(2^{p-1})\\sigma(2^p - 1)$. Since $2^p - 1$ is prime, $\\sigma(2^p - 1) = 2^p$. Also, $\\sigma(2^{p-1}) = 1 + 2 + 2^2 + \\cdots + 2^{p-1} = 2^p - 1$. Thus, $\\sigma(n) = (2^p - 1) \\cdot 2^p = 2 \\cdot 2^{p-1}(2^p - 1) = 2n$, proving $n$ is perfect.\n\n## Step 10: Outline the proof that every even perfect number is of the form $2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$.\nLet $n$ be an even perfect number. Then $n = 2^k \\cdot m$, where $m$ is odd. Since $n$ is perfect, $\\sigma(n) = 2n$. Using the multiplicative property of $\\sigma$, we have $\\sigma(n) = \\sigma(2^k)\\sigma(m) = (2^{k+1} - 1)\\sigma(m)$. Thus, $(2^{k+1} - 1)\\sigma(m) = 2^{k+1}m$. This implies $2^{k+1} - 1$ divides $m$, so $m = (2^{k+1} - 1)d$ for some $d$. Substituting back gives $\\sigma(m) = 2^{k+1}d$. For $d = 1$, $m = 2^{k+1} - 1$ is prime, and $\\sigma(m) = m + 1 = 2^{k+1}$, which matches our requirement. For $d > 1$, it leads to a contradiction because $\\sigma(m) \\geq m + d > 2d$, unless $d = 1$ and $m$ is prime.\n\n## Step 11: Conclude the solution.\nThe given statement is a direct consequence of the Euclid-Euler theorem, which characterizes even perfect numbers.\n\nThe final answer is: \n\nProve that if $n$ is an even perfect number, then $n = 2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$, where $2^p - 1$ is a Mersenne prime.",

    "question": "## Step 1: Understand the task\nThe task is to generate a challenging mathematics problem in the domain of commutative algebra, along with a complete and verifiable solution. The problem must be well-posed, clear, non-trivial, and solvable with established mathematical methods.\n\n## Step 2: Identify a suitable topic in commutative algebra\nCommutative algebra involves the study of commutative rings and their ideals, modules, and algebras. A challenging problem could involve understanding the properties of ideals, quotient rings, or the behavior of polynomials over certain rings.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a specific problem\nLet's consider a problem involving the properties of ideals in a polynomial ring. Specifically, we can examine the ideal generated by a set of polynomials and ask questions about its properties, such as whether it is prime or maximal.\n\n## Step 4: Construct the problem\nConsider the polynomial ring $\\mathbb{Q}[x, y]$ and the ideal $I = (x^2 + y^2, xy)$. We can ask: Is the ideal $I$ prime? To make it more challenging and ensure it's well-posed, we can ask to determine whether $I$ is radical, i.e., whether it is equal to its radical $\\sqrt{I}$.\n\n## Step 5: Write down the problem statement\nLet $I = (x^2 + y^2, xy)$ be an ideal in $\\mathbb{Q}[x, y]$. Determine whether $I = \\sqrt{I}$, where $\\sqrt{I} = \\{f \\in \\mathbb{Q}[x, y] \\mid f^n \\in I \\text{ for some } n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$.\n\n## Step 6: Provide the solution\nTo determine if $I = \\sqrt{I}$, we first need to understand what $\\sqrt{I}$ is. An element $f \\in \\mathbb{Q}[x, y]$ is in $\\sqrt{I}$ if $f^n \\in I$ for some $n$. We need to check if there are elements in $\\sqrt{I}$ that are not in $I$.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze the ideal $I$\nTo check if $I = \\sqrt{I}$, let's first examine the quotient ring $\\mathbb{Q}[x, y]/I$. The ideal $I$ contains $x^2 + y^2$ and $xy$, which implies that $x^2 + y^2$ and $xy$ are zero in $\\mathbb{Q}[x, y]/I$. We can simplify this by observing that $x^2y + y^3 = 0$ and $x^2y = 0$ in $\\mathbb{Q}[x, y]/I$, implying $y^3 = 0$ in $\\mathbb{Q}[x, y]/I$. Similarly, $x^3 = 0$.\n\n## Step 8: Check if $I$ is radical\nSince $x^3 = 0$ and $y^3 = 0$ in $\\mathbb{Q}[x, y]/I$, it follows that $x, y \\in \\sqrt{I}$ because $x^3, y^3 \\in I$. We need to verify if $x$ and $y$ are in $I$. If not, then $I \\neq \\sqrt{I}$.\n\n## Step 9: Verify if $x$ and $y$ are in $I$\nTo check if $x \\in I$, we need to see if there exist $f, g \\in \\mathbb{Q}[x, y]$ such that $x = f(x^2 + y^2) + g(xy)$. This simplifies to checking if $x$ can be expressed as a combination of $x^2 + y^2$ and $xy$, which is not possible because any element in $I$ is of degree at least 2.\n\n## Step 10: Conclude on $I = \\sqrt{I}$\nSince $x, y \\in \\sqrt{I}$ but $x, y \\notin I$, it follows that $I \\neq \\sqrt{I}$. Thus, $I$ is not radical.\n\nThe final answer is: \n\nLet $I = (x^2 + y^2, xy)$ be an ideal in $\\mathbb{Q}[x, y]$. Determine whether $I = \\sqrt{I}$, where $\\sqrt{I} = \\{f \\in \\mathbb{Q}[x, y] \\mid f^n \\in I \\text{ for some } n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$.",

The problem should be well-posed, clear, non-trivial, and solvable with established mathematical methods.\n\n## Step 2: Identify a suitable topic within algebraic geometry\nAlgebraic geometry is a broad field that involves the study of geometric objects, such as varieties and schemes, using tools from abstract algebra. A suitable topic could involve the study of curves, surfaces, or higher-dimensional varieties, and their properties.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a specific problem\nLet's consider a problem involving the intersection of curves on a surface. A classic result in algebraic geometry is B\u00e9zout's theorem, which describes the intersection of two curves on a projective plane. We can formulate a problem related to this.\n\n## Step 4: State the problem\nConsider two curves $C_1$ and $C_2$ on $\\mathbb{P}^2$, defined by homogeneous polynomials $f(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 - z^2$ and $g(x,y,z) = xy - z^2$, respectively. Find the number of intersection points of $C_1$ and $C_2$ in $\\mathbb{P}^2$, counted with multiplicity.\n\n## Step 5: Provide the solution\nTo find the intersection points, we need to solve the system of equations given by $f(x,y,z) = 0$ and $g(x,y,z) = 0$. This means we have to solve $x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = 0$ and $xy - z^2 = 0$ simultaneously.\n\n## Step 6: Solve the system of equations\nFirst, from $xy - z^2 = 0$, we can express $z^2 = xy$. Substituting $z^2$ into the first equation gives $x^2 + y^2 - xy = 0$. This is a homogeneous equation in $x$ and $y$, which can be solved by considering it as a quadratic form.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze the quadratic form\nThe equation $x^2 - xy + y^2 = 0$ can be analyzed by finding its roots. This is equivalent to solving $x^2 - xy + y^2 = 0$ for $x$ in terms of $y$ (or vice versa), treating it as a quadratic equation.\n\n## Step 8: Solve for $x$ in terms of $y$\nUsing the quadratic formula, $x = \\frac{y \\pm \\sqrt{y^2 - 4y^2}}{2} = \\frac{y \\pm \\sqrt{-3y^2}}{2}$. For $y \\neq 0$, this simplifies to $x = \\frac{y(1 \\pm i\\sqrt{3})}{2}$. Thus, $x = y\\omega$ or $x = y\\omega^2$, where $\\omega$ is a primitive third root of unity.\n\n## Step 9: Determine the intersection points\nFor $x = y\\omega$ and $x = y\\omega^2$, substituting back into $xy = z^2$ gives $y^2\\omega = z^2$ and $y^2\\omega^2 = z^2$, respectively. This implies $z = \\pm y\\sqrt{\\omega}$ and $z = \\pm y\\sqrt{\\omega^2}$. However, we must consider the projective nature and the fact that we're working with homogeneous coordinates.\n\n## Step 10: Count the intersection points with multiplicity\nSince $\\omega$ and $\\omega^2$ are not real, and we're working over $\\mathbb{C}$, we need to consider the solutions in $\\mathbb{P}^2(\\mathbb{C})$. The solutions are given by the pairs $(x:y:z)$ satisfying both equations. We need to check if there are any solutions where $y = 0$, which would imply $x = 0$ and thus $z = 0$, but $(0,0,0)$ is not a valid point in $\\mathbb{P}^2$.\n\n## Step 11: Apply B\u00e9zout's theorem for a simpler solution\nB\u00e9zout's theorem states that two curves of degrees $d_1$ and $d_2$ intersect in $d_1d_2$ points, counted with multiplicity, if they have no common components. Here, $C_1$ and $C_2$ are both of degree 2, so they should intersect in $2 \\times 2 = 4$ points.\n\nThe final answer is: \n\nConsider two curves $C_1$ and $C_2$ on $\\mathbb{P}^2$, defined by homogeneous polynomials $f(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 - z^2$ and $g(x,y,z) = xy - z^2$, respectively.

It is solvable using established methods in linear algebra.\n\n## Step 6: Provide a complete solution to the problem\nTo solve this, we note that $A$ satisfies the polynomial $x^3 - 1 = 0$. This polynomial factors as $(x-1)(x^2 + x + 1) = 0$. The roots are $1$, $e^{2\\pi i/3}$, and $e^{4\\pi i/3}$. Since $A$ satisfies this polynomial, its eigenvalues must be among these roots. Because the minimal polynomial of $A$ divides $x^3 - 1$ and has distinct roots (since $x^3 - 1$ has distinct roots), $A$ is diagonalizable over $\\mathbb{C}$.\n\n## Step 7: Write the problem and solution in the required format\n\nLet $A$ be a $3 \\times 3$ real matrix such that $A^3 = I$, where $I$ is the $3 \\times 3$ identity matrix. Prove that $A$ is diagonalizable over $\\mathbb{C}$.",

    "question": "## Step 1: Understand the task and the domain\nThe task is to generate a challenging but solvable mathematics problem in the domain of associative rings and algebras, along with a complete and verifiable solution. The problem should be well-posed, clear, non-trivial, and solvable with established mathematical methods.\n\n## Step 2: Identify a suitable topic within associative rings and algebras\nAssociative rings and algebras involve the study of algebraic structures with associative multiplication. A suitable topic could involve properties of ideals, quotient rings, or specific types of algebras like matrix algebras.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a problem\nLet's consider a problem involving the properties of a specific type of associative algebra. For instance, we could explore the characteristics of a matrix algebra over a ring.\n\n## Step 4: Generate a specific problem\nConsider the ring $R = \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ and the matrix algebra $M_2(R)$ of $2 \\times 2$ matrices with entries in $R$. Let's examine the properties of ideals in $M_2(R)$.\n\n## Step 5: Formulate the problem statement\n\"Let $R = \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ and consider the matrix algebra $M_2(R)$. Prove that $M_2(R)$ is not a simple ring, i.e., it has a non-trivial ideal.\"\n\n## Step 6: Provide the solution\nTo solve this, we need to show that there exists a non-trivial ideal in $M_2(R)$. An ideal $I$ in $M_2(R)$ is a subset that is closed under addition and under multiplication by any element of $M_2(R)$ from either side.\n\n## Step 7: Identify a non-trivial ideal\nConsider the set $I$ of matrices in $M_2(R)$ where all entries are even (i.e., $0$ or $2$ mod $4$). This set is non-empty and not equal to $M_2(R)$ because it does not contain matrices with odd entries.\n\n## Step 8: Verify that $I$ is an ideal\nFor $I$ to be an ideal, it must be closed under addition and under multiplication by elements of $M_2(R)$. For any two matrices $A, B \\in I$, $A + B$ has even entries because the sum of even numbers is even, so $A + B \\in I$. For any $A \\in I$ and $C \\in M_2(R)$, the product $CA$ and $AC$ will have entries that are products and sums of products involving elements of $R$. Since $A$ has even entries, $CA$ and $AC$ will also have even entries because multiplying any element of $R$ by an even element results in an even element.\n\n## Step 9: Check if $I$ is non-trivial\n$I$ is non-trivial if it is not the zero ideal and not the entire ring $M_2(R)$. The zero matrix is in $I$, and there are non-zero matrices in $I$ (e.g., $\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$), so $I$ is not the zero ideal. $I$ is not $M_2(R)$ because, for example, $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\notin I$.\n\n## Step 10: Conclude the solution\nSince $I$ is a non-trivial ideal, $M_2(R)$ is not a simple ring.\n\nThe final answer is: \n\nLet $R = \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ and consider the matrix algebra $M_2(R)$. Prove that $M_2(R)$ is not a simple ring, i.e., it has a non-trivial ideal.",

We have $A \\in M_2(R)$.\n\n## Step 2\nFor any matrix $B \\in M_2(R)$, we have $AB = BA = 2B$. Thus, $A$ is not invertible.\n\n## Step 3\nThe ideal generated by $A$ is the set of all matrices of the form $2B$, where $B$ is any matrix in $M_2(R)$.\n\n## Step 4\nSince $2B = 0$ for any $B \\in M_2(R)$, we have that $A = 0$ in $M_2(R)/2M_2(R)$.\n\n## Step 5\nThus, $A$ is nilpotent.\n\n## Step 6\nTherefore, $M_2(R)$ is not a field.\n\n## Step 7\nIn fact, $M_2(R)$ has zero divisors.\n\nThe final answer is: \n$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}}$.\n\n\n\n## Step 8\nThis shows that $M_2(R)$ is not a division ring.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{0}$.\n\n## Step 9\nSince $0 \\cdot 2 = 0$, we have $2 = 0$ in $R/2R$.\n\n## Step 10\nHence, $M_2(R)$ is not a field.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$.\n\n\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$.\n\n\n\n## Step 11\nWe conclude that the matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$ is not invertible in $M_2(R)$.\n\n\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$.\n\n\n\n## Step 10\nCheck that the matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$ is in $M_2(R)$.\n\n\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$.\n\n\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$.\n\n\n\n## Step 1\nTo verify that $I$ is an ideal, we need to check that it is closed under addition and that for any $r \\in R$ and $i \\in I$, we have $ri \\in I$ and $ir \\in I$.\n\n## Step 2\nLet's check if $I$ is closed under addition. For any $a, b \\in I$, we have $a + b \\in I$ because $I$ is an additive subgroup.\n\n## Step 3\nNow, let's verify if $I$ is closed under scalar multiplication. For any $r \\in R$ and $a \\in I$, we have $ra \\in I$ and $ar \\in I$ because $I$ is a two-sided ideal.\n\n## Step 4\nWe need to check if $I$ satisfies the properties of an ideal.\n\n## Step 5\nFor any $a, b \\in I$, we have $a + b \\in I$ and $ab \\in I$.\n\n## Step 6\nThis shows that $I$ is closed under addition and multiplication.\n\n## Step 7\nTherefore, $I$ is an ideal of $R$.\n\n## Step 8\nHence, $I$ is an ideal.\n\n## Step 9\nThis ideal is not necessarily prime.\n\n## Step 10\nHowever, it is a two-sided ideal.\n\n## Step 11\nThus, $R/I$ is a ring.\n\n## Step 12\nMoreover, $R/I$ is isomorphic to $R/\\mathfrak{p}$ for some prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}$.\n\n## Step 13\nTherefore, $I = \\mathfrak{p}$.\n\n## Step 14\nThis shows that $I$ is a prime ideal.\n\n## Step 15\nHence, $R/I$ is an integral domain.\n\n## Step 16\nThis implies that $I$ is a maximal ideal.\n\n## Step 17\nTherefore, $R/I$ is a field.\n\n## Step 18\nThus, $I$ is a maximal ideal.\n\nThe final answer is:

We have $A \\in M_2(R)$.\n\n## Step 2\nFor any matrix $B \\in M_2(R)$, we have $AB = BA = 2B$. Thus, $A$ is not invertible.\n\n## Step 3\nThe ideal generated by $A$ is the set of all matrices of the form $2B$, where $B$ is any matrix in $M_2(R)$.\n\n## Step 4\nSince $2B = 0$ for any $B \\in M_2(R)$, we have that $A = 0$ in $M_2(R)/2M_2(R)$.\n\n## Step 5\nThus, $A$ is nilpotent.\n\n## Step 6\nTherefore, $M_2(R)$ is not a field.\n\n## Step 7\nIn fact, $M_2(R)$ has zero divisors.\n\nThe final answer is: \n$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}}$.\n\n\n\n## Step 8\nThis shows that $M_2(R)$ is not a division ring.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{0}$.\n\n## Step 9\nSince $0 \\cdot 2 = 0$, we have $2 = 0$ in $R/2R$.\n\n## Step 10\nHence, $M_2(R)$ is not a field.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$.\n\n\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$.\n\n\n\n## Step 11\nWe conclude that the matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$ is not invertible in $M_2(R)$.\n\n\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$.\n\n\n\n## Step 10\nCheck that the matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$ is in $M_2(R)$.\n\n\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$.\n\n\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$.\n\n\n\n## Step 1\nTo verify that $I$ is an ideal, we need to check that it is closed under addition and that for any $r \\in R$ and $i \\in I$, we have $ri \\in I$ and $ir \\in I$.\n\n## Step 2\nLet's check if $I$ is closed under addition. For any $a, b \\in I$, we have $a + b \\in I$ because $I$ is an additive subgroup.\n\n## Step 3\nNow, let's verify if $I$ is closed under scalar multiplication. For any $r \\in R$ and $a \\in I$, we have $ra \\in I$ and $ar \\in I$ because $I$ is a two-sided ideal.\n\n## Step 4\nWe need to check if $I$ satisfies the properties of an ideal.\n\n## Step 5\nFor any $a, b \\in I$, we have $a + b \\in I$ and $ab \\in I$.\n\n## Step 6\nThis shows that $I$ is closed under addition and multiplication.\n\n## Step 7\nTherefore, $I$ is an ideal of $R$.\n\n## Step 8\nHence, $I$ is an ideal.\n\n## Step 9\nThis ideal is not necessarily prime.\n\n## Step 10\nHowever, it is a two-sided ideal.\n\n## Step 11\nThus, $R/I$ is a ring.\n\n## Step 12\nMoreover, $R/I$ is isomorphic to $R/\\mathfrak{p}$ for some prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}$.\n\n## Step 13\nTherefore, $I = \\mathfrak{p}$.\n\n## Step 14\nThis shows that $I$ is a prime ideal.\n\n## Step 15\nHence, $R/I$ is an integral domain.\n\n## Step 16\nThis implies that $I$ is a maximal ideal.\n\n## Step 17\nTherefore, $R/I$ is a field.\n\n## Step 18\nThus, $I$ is a maximal ideal.\n\nThe final answer is:
