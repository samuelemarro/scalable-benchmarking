However, this contradicts the assumption that $X$ is non-compact, as $X$ would then have a finite subcover, which is not possible.\"* This is wrong: non-compactness means **there exists** an open cover of $X$ with no finite subcover, not that **every** open cover lacks a finite subcover. The correct reason that some $U_j$ contains $\\infty$ is simply that the family covers $\\alpha X$, hence must cover $\\infty$.\n\n2) **Hausdorffness proof mishandles local compactness / openness.** In the case $x\\in X$, $y=\\infty$, it states: *\"since $X$ is locally compact, there exists a compact neighborhood $K$ of $x$. Then $U=X\\setminus K$ is open ... The set $V=K$ is open in $X\"*. In a locally compact Hausdorff space, one generally gets an **open** neighborhood $V$ of $x$ with **compact closure** $\\overline V$, not an open-and-compact neighborhood.
