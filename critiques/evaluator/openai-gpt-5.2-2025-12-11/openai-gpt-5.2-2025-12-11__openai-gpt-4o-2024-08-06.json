An $L$-structure $G$ is called a (simple undirected) **graph** if it satisfies\n$$\n\\forall x\\,\\neg E(x,x)\\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\forall x\\forall y\\,(E(x,y)\\leftrightarrow E(y,x)).\n$$\nFor finite, disjoint sets of vertices $U,V\\subseteq G$, say that a vertex $z$ **realizes the adjacency pattern** $(U,V)$ if $z\\notin U\\cup V$ and\n$$\n(\\forall u\\in U)\\,E(z,u)\\quad\\text{and}\\quad(\\forall v\\in V)\\,\\neg E(z,v).\n$$\n\nLet $T$ be the following first-order theory in $L$:\n1. the two graph axioms above, and  \n2. for every pair of integers $m,n\\ge 0$, the **extension axiom**\n$$\n\\forall u_1\\ldots u_m\\,\\forall v_1\\ldots v_n\\Bigl(\\mathrm{Distinct}(u_1,\\dots,u_m,v_1,\\dots,v_n)\\to \\exists z\\,\\Phi(z;\\bar u,\\bar v)\\Bigr),\n$$\nwhere $\\mathrm{Distinct}(\\cdots)$ asserts all the listed variables are pairwise distinct, and\n$$\n\\Phi(z;\\bar u,\\bar v):=\\Bigl(\\bigwedge_{i=1}^m z\\neq u_i\\Bigr)\\wedge\\Bigl(\\bigwedge_{j=1}^n z\\neq v_j\\Bigr)\\wedge\\Bigl(\\bigwedge_{i=1}^m E(z,u_i)\\Bigr)\\wedge\\Bigl(\\bigwedge_{j=1}^n \\neg E(z,v_j)\\Bigr).\n$$\n\nA model of $T$ is thus a graph in which every finite disjoint pair $(U,V)$ has a realizing vertex.\n\n1) Prove that $T$ is consistent (i.e. has a model). You must do this by showing every finite subset of $T$ has a model and then invoking the Compactness Theorem.\n\n2) Using the Downward L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem Theorem, deduce that $T$ has a **countable** model.\n\n3) Prove that any two **countable** models of $T$ are isomorphic (so $T$ is $\\aleph_0$-categorical). Your proof must give an explicit back-and-forth construction.",
