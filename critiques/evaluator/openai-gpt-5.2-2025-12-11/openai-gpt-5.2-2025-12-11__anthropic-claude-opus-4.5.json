          "improvements": "The critique is accurate overall: the formulas $\\omega_{\\mathrm{opt}}=\\frac{2}{1+\\sin(\\pi/(n+1))}$ and $\\rho_{\\min}=\\frac{1-\\sin(\\pi/(n+1))}{1+\\sin(\\pi/(n+1))}$ are standard and correct for SOR on the 1D Poisson tridiagonal matrix, and the asymptotic $\\rho_{\\min}=1-\\frac{2\\pi}{n+1}+O(n^{-2})$ follows from $\\sin(\\pi/(n+1))\\sim \\pi/(n+1)$. The critique JSON is valid and matches the stated critique-format requirements (has a valid `verdict`, `notes` string, and optional `suggestions`). If you wanted to strengthen it further, you could mention (i) Young\u2019s relation often appears with a $\\pm$ sign before squaring, and (ii) a brief justification of why the minimizer corresponds to the discriminant-zero condition for the extremal Jacobi mode; but these are minor since the critique already flags the latter as a rigor improvement."
