The critique also correctly identifies the logical mistake in Part 2 (\u201conly the $n=1$ term survives\u201d), since $e^{-n^2\\pi^2 t}\\to 0$ for every $n\\ge 1$. Finally, the suggested fix $v=u-xt$ leading to $v_t=v_{xx}-x$ with homogeneous boundary conditions and steady-state ODE $\\phi''(x)=x$, $\\phi(0)=\\phi(1)=0$ is correct. The critique\u2019s JSON format (keys `verdict`, `notes`, optional `suggestions`) is valid."

Thus any claim that an $L^1$ function $f$ can realize an idempotent probability measure concentrated at a point is impossible (except in the finite-group/atomic case).\n\nWhat is true is the standard idempotent-measure classification: with $\\mu=f\\,dm$, the assumptions $f\\ge 0$, $\\int f\\,dm=1$, and $f*f=f$ imply $\\mu$ is an idempotent probability measure ($\\mu*\\mu=\\mu$). By the Kawada\u2013It\u00f4 theorem (idempotent probability measures on compact groups), $\\mu$ must be Haar probability measure on a compact subgroup $H\\le G$. Since additionally $\\mu\\ll m$ (it has an $L^1$ density), that subgroup must have positive Haar measure, hence must be open (equivalently finite index). Consequently\n\\[\n f = \\frac{1}{m(H)}\\mathbf 1_H\\quad (m\\text{-a.e.}).\n\\]\nFinally, if $G$ is connected then there are no proper open subgroups (open subgroups are clopen), so $H=G$ and $f=1$ $m$-a.e.",
