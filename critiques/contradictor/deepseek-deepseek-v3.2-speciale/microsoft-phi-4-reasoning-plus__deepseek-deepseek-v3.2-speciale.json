        "notes": "The answer correctly models the problem as a Markov chain and sets up the system of equations for the expected number of tosses to reach the absorbing state. Each transition probability and expected value equation is derived logically and consistently. The solution correctly solves the system of equations to find the expected value $\\mathbb{E}[N]$ in terms of $p$ and $q$. The final expression $\\frac{1 + p - p^2}{p^2 (1-p)^2}$ is verified to be correct, and the explanation about the behavior as $p$ approaches 0 or 1 is consistent with intuition. The answer is mathematically sound, complete, and adequately rigorous.",
