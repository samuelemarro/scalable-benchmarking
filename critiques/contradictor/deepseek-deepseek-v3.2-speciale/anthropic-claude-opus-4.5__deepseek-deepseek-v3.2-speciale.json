Symmetry uses $\\operatorname{tr}(AB) = \\operatorname{tr}(BA)$ correctly.\n\n**(b)** The key identity $\\operatorname{ad}_{[x,y]} = [\\operatorname{ad}_x, \\operatorname{ad}_y]$ (which follows from the Jacobi identity) is correctly applied. The computation using cyclic property of trace to show $\\operatorname{tr}(\\operatorname{ad}_x \\operatorname{ad}_z \\operatorname{ad}_y) = \\operatorname{tr}(\\operatorname{ad}_y \\operatorname{ad}_x \\operatorname{ad}_z)$ is valid.\n\n**(c)** The proof correctly uses invariance: for $r \\in \\operatorname{Rad}(\\kappa)$ and $g \\in \\mathfrak{g}$, $\\kappa([r,g], s) = \\kappa(r, [g,s]) = 0$ for all $s$, so $[r,g] \\in \\operatorname{Rad}(\\kappa)$.\n\n**(d)** The contrapositive proof is rigorous. For nonzero abelian ideal $I$ with $0 \\neq a \\in I$, the argument that $T = \\operatorname{ad}_a \\circ \\operatorname{ad}_x$ satisfies $T^2 = 0$ is correct: $T(y) \\in I$ (since $I$ is an ideal and $a \\in I$), then $[x, T(y)] \\in I$, and $[a, [x, T(y)]] = 0$ since $I$ is abelian. Nilpotent operators have trace 0, so $\\kappa(a, x) = 0$ for all $x$, placing nonzero $a$ in the radical. The additional observation about solvable ideals (derived series yields an abelian ideal) is correct and shows the connection to the broader definition of semisimplicity.",
