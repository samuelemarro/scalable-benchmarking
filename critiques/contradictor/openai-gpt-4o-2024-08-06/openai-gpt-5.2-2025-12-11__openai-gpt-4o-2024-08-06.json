Similar branch-misclassification errors occur in Cases 2 and 3.\n\nAdditionally, the listed solutions are not filtered by the required subcase conditions (e.g., the equation $T(9x)=27x-1$ is only valid when $9x\\in[1/3,2/3)$, etc.), so even within its flawed setup the derivation is incomplete.\n\nFinally, for this map (which is $x\\mapsto 3x\\bmod 1$ except at $x=1$), solving $T^3(x)=x$ yields many more solutions than the eight listed; in fact $T^3(x)=x$ holds for all $x=k/26$ (and also $x=1$), and excluding fixed points ($x=0,1/2,1$) leaves many more period-3 points than the answer provides.
