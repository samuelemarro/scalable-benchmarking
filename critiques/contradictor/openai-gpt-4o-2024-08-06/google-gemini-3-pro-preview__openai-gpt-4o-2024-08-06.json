        "notes": "The answer correctly establishes that the radical of an ideal is an ideal. It rigorously verifies closure under addition using the Binomial Theorem (making use of the commutative property) and closure under multiplication. Although the problem statement specifies that the ideal is finitely generated, the proof provided holds generally for any ideal in a commutative ring, which implies it holds for the specific case requested.",
