Define a structure $\\mathcal{M} = (M, R^{\\mathcal{M}})$ where $M = \\mathbb{Z}$ (the set of all integers) and $R^{\\mathcal{M}}(x, y)$ is interpreted as \"$x$ is less than $y$\" (i.e., $x < y$).\n\nProve or disprove: There exists a sentence $\\varphi \\in \\mathcal{L}$ such that $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\varphi$ and for any structure $\\mathcal{N} = (N, R^{\\mathcal{N}})$ with $N$ being a finite set, $\\mathcal{N} \\not\\models \\varphi$.",
