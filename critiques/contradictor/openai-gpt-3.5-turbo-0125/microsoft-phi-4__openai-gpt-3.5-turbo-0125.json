        "evaluation": {
          "verdict": "correct",
          "issues": [],
          "improvements": "The critique accurately identifies the transformation of the random variable and correctly applies the formula for transforming probability density functions. The steps are logically valid, and the final answer is mathematically sound. The transformation process and the derivation of the pdf for Y are correctly handled, and the edge cases are appropriately addressed. The critique is concise and objective, focusing on the mathematical correctness and completeness of the solution."
