It correctly verifies that: (1) splitting \u03b1 = 0.05 equally between tails gives 0.025 in each tail, (2) the critical z-values \u00b11.96 correspond to these tail probabilities in the standard normal distribution, (3) using the z-distribution is appropriate because \u03c3 = 5 is known and X follows a normal distribution, and (4) the rejection region interpretation is correct. The critique also correctly notes that the question specifically asks for critical values 'using the standard normal distribution table,' making the z-critical values (\u00b11.96) the appropriate answer rather than critical values expressed in terms of X\u0304. The JSON format is valid with correct verdict, and notes provide specific evidence-based reasoning."
