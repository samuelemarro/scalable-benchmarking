Consider the complete graph $K_n$: every vertex has degree $n-1$, and since $n-1 \\geq \\lceil n/2 \\rceil$ for all $n \\geq 2$, every vertex is a hub. Therefore, the maximum number of hubs is $n$, not $\\frac{n}{2}$. Furthermore, the answer's reasoning is deeply flawed\u2014it correctly states that each vertex can have degree up to $n-1$, but then concludes without justification that 'the maximum number of hubs in this case is $\\frac{n}{2}$.' There is no logical connection between these statements, and no upper bound argument or construction is provided.",
