Indeed, $$U\\cap V=(X\\setminus B)\\cap (X\\setminus A)=X\\setminus (A\\cup B),$$ which need not be empty even when $A\\cap B=\\varnothing$ (e.g., in $\\mathbb{R}$ take $A=\\{0\\}$ and $B=\\{1\\}$, then $U\\cap V=\\mathbb{R}\\setminus\\{0,1\\}\\neq\\varnothing$). Thus the step 'since $A$ and $B$ are closed and disjoint, $X\\setminus A$ and $X\\setminus B$ are also disjoint' is invalid. Additionally, the statement being proved is not true for arbitrary topological spaces: the property that any two disjoint closed sets can be separated by disjoint open neighborhoods is (a common) definition of normality; many spaces are not normal, so there are counterexamples where such $U,V$ do not exist. (Some authors also require $T_1$ in the definition of 'normal', so conventions may vary.)",

Also explicitly correct the mistaken inference about complements: disjointness of $A$ and $B$ does not imply disjointness of $X\\setminus A$ and $X\\setminus B$.",
