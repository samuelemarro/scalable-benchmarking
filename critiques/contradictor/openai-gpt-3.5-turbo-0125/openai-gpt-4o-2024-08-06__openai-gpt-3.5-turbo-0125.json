        "notes": "The solution incorrectly applies partial fraction decomposition. The expression $\\frac{x^3}{1 + x^2}$ cannot be decomposed into $\\frac{Ax + B}{1 + x^2}$ because the degree of the numerator is higher than the degree of the denominator. Instead, polynomial long division should be used to rewrite $\\frac{x^3}{1 + x^2}$ as $x - x + \\frac{x}{1 + x^2}$. The integral should then be split into $\\int_0^1 x \\, dx - \\int_0^1 x \\, dx + \\int_0^1 \\frac{x}{1 + x^2} \\, dx$. The first two integrals cancel each other, and the third integral can be solved using the substitution $u = 1 + x^2$, leading to the correct result.",
        "suggestions": "Use polynomial long division to simplify the integrand and then solve the resulting integrals. The correct approach involves splitting the integral into simpler parts and using substitution for the remaining integral.",
