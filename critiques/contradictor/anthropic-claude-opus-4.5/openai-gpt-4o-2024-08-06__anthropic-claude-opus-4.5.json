    "question": "**Overspill in Nonstandard Models of Arithmetic**\n\nLet $\\mathcal{M} = (M, 0, S, +, \\cdot, <)$ be a **nonstandard model** of first-order Peano Arithmetic (PA), meaning $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\text{PA}$ and $M$ properly contains the standard natural numbers $\\mathbb{N}$. Elements of $M$ corresponding to the standard numerals $\\underline{n} = S^n(0)$ are called **standard**; all other elements are called **nonstandard**.\n\n**(a)** Prove the **Overspill Lemma**: Let $\\phi(x, \\vec{y})$ be a formula in the language of arithmetic, and let $\\vec{b} \\in M$ be parameters. If \n$$\\mathcal{M} \\models \\phi(\\underline{n}, \\vec{b})$$\nfor every standard natural number $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, then there exists a **nonstandard** element $c \\in M \\setminus \\mathbb{N}$ such that $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\phi(c, \\vec{b})$.\n\n**(b)** Using part (a), prove that every nonstandard model $\\mathcal{M}$ of PA contains a nonstandard element $a$ such that $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\text{\"}2^a \\text{ exists\"}$ (exponentiation is defined at $a$), and $\\mathcal{M} \\models 2^a > \\underline{n}$ for every standard $n$.\n\n**(c)** Let $\\text{Pr}(x)$ denote the formula expressing \"$x$ is prime\" (formalizable in PA). Prove that every nonstandard model of PA contains infinitely many nonstandard primes\u2014that is, infinitely many elements $p \\in M \\setminus \\mathbb{N}$ satisfying $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\text{Pr}(p)$.\n\n---",
