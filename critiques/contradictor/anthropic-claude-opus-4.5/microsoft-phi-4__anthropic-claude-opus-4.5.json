        "notes": "The answer correctly determines the nodes and weights for the two-point Gaussian quadrature rule, ensuring exactness for polynomials up to degree 3. The symmetry argument and subsequent calculations for $x_1$, $x_2$, $w_1$, and $w_2$ are valid. The error term calculation for part (b) is accurate, using $f(x) = x^4$ to find $c$. In part (c), the linear transformation and application of the quadrature rule are correctly executed, leading to the exact closed form expression for the integral approximation.",
