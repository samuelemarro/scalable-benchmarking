The map $T(x) = 5x \\pmod 1$ is a 5-to-1 mapping (an endomorphism), not a bijection. A map with derivative $|T'(x)|=5$ everywhere on $[0,1]$ cannot be a bijection on the unit interval.\n2. The formula provided for $T^{-1}$ is invalid. It defines a function whose image is a union of disjoint small intervals (e.g., $[0, 1/25) \\cup [0.24, 0.28) \\dots$) rather than the full domain $[0,1]$, and it fails to capture the multiple pre-images of points in the domain.\n3. It describes the map as having slopes $\\pm 5$, but the explicit formula in the prompt ($5x - k$) corresponds to a map with constant slope $+5$ (the Bernoulli shift), not a Tent map (which would have alternating slopes).\n\nWhile the final value for the topological entropy is correct for this map, the reasoning regarding the map's basic structure (invertibility) is logically flawed.",
        "suggestions": "Correct the analysis to reflect that $T$ is the 5-way Bernoulli shift ($x \\mapsto 5x \\mod 1$), which is a non-invertible, many-to-one expanding map. Remove the claim of invertibility and the incorrect inverse function. Prove ergodicity using properties of expanding maps (e.g., the map is exact or admits an equivalent invariant ergodic measure which is Lebesgue) rather than arguments relying on invertibility. Note that the slope is constantly $+5$.",

The cubic term makes $f(u)$ only locally Lipschitz. Consequently, the standard global existence theorem for globally Lipschitz source terms does not apply. To prove global existence, one must establish an *a priori* $L^\\infty$ bound (e.g., using the Maximum Principle) to prevent finite-time blow-up, which the answer fails to do.\n\n2. **Long-term Behavior**: The analysis of the long-term behavior is flawed for the domain $\\mathbb{R}^n$. \n   - The constant functions $u \\equiv \\pm 1$ are not in $L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ nor do they vanish at infinity, so they are not valid limits for a solution with compactly supported initial data in the standard function spaces associated with this problem (where $u \\to 0$ as $|x| \\to \\infty$).\n   - The condition regarding the '$L^2$-norm of $u(x, t)$ is closer to 1' is mathematically ill-defined, as the $L^2$ norm of the constant function $1$ over $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is infinite.",
