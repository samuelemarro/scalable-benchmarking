It encompasses topics such as permutations, combinations, graph theory, and more.\n\n## Step 3: Generate a problem\nTo create a challenging problem, let's consider a topic within Combinatorics that is both interesting and requires substantial reasoning. A potential topic is graph theory, specifically focusing on graph coloring or connectivity.\n\n## Step 4: Formulate the problem\nLet's formulate a problem: \"Prove that in any simple graph with $n$ vertices, if the graph is connected and has no cycles (i.e., it's a tree), then it has exactly $n-1$ edges.\"\n\n## Step 5: Verify the problem against the quality rubric\n- **Well-Posedness and Completeness**: The problem is self-contained, defines the necessary terms (simple graph, connected, no cycles, tree), and asks for a proof.\n- **Clarity**: The terms used are standard in graph theory, and the task is clear.\n- **Non-Triviality**: The problem requires understanding of graph theory and a proof involving induction or another suitable method, making it non-trivial.\n- **Solvability and Verification**: The statement is a known fact in graph theory and can be proven using established methods.\n\n## Step 6: Provide the solution\nTo solve this, we can use induction on $n$. For $n=1$, a tree has 0 edges, and $1-1=0$, so the statement holds. For $n>1$, assume the statement is true for all trees with fewer than $n$ vertices. A tree with $n$ vertices has at least one leaf (a vertex of degree 1); removing this leaf and its edge gives a tree with $n-1$ vertices. By the induction hypothesis, this smaller tree has $(n-1)-1 = n-2$ edges. Adding back the removed edge gives $n-2 + 1 = n-1$ edges, proving the statement for $n$.\n\n## Step 7: Format the output\nLet's format the problem and solution according to the required structure.\n\n\nLet $G$ be a simple graph with $n$ vertices. Prove that if $G$ is a tree (i.e., it is connected and has no cycles), then it has exactly $n-1$ edges.",

The problem must be well-posed, clear, non-trivial, and solvable with established mathematical methods.\n\n## Step 2: Identify a suitable topic within number theory.\nNumber theory encompasses various topics such as divisibility, prime numbers, congruences, and Diophantine equations. A challenging problem could involve proving a property related to prime numbers or solving a specific type of Diophantine equation.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a problem that meets the criteria.\nLet's consider a problem involving the sum of divisors of a number and its relation to perfect numbers. A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors, excluding the number itself.\n\n## Step 4: Specify the problem.\nConsider the following problem: \"Prove that if $n$ is an even perfect number, then $n = 2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$, where $2^p - 1$ is a Mersenne prime.\"\n\n## Step 5: Provide the solution to the problem.\nTo solve this, we need to understand the definition of an even perfect number and its relation to Mersenne primes.\n\n## Step 6: Recall the definition and properties of even perfect numbers.\nAn even perfect number $n$ can be written as $n = 2^{k-1}(2^k - 1)$, where $2^k - 1$ is prime. This is known as the Euclid-Euler theorem.\n\n## Step 7: State the Euclid-Euler theorem.\nThe Euclid-Euler theorem states that every even perfect number is of the form $2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$, where $2^p - 1$ is a Mersenne prime (i.e., $2^p - 1$ is prime).\n\n## Step 8: Provide the proof or reasoning for the given statement.\nThe proof involves two main parts: (1) showing that any number of the form $2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$, where $2^p - 1$ is prime, is perfect, and (2) showing that every even perfect number is of this form.\n\n## Step 9: Outline the proof that $2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$ is perfect when $2^p - 1$ is prime.\nLet $n = 2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$. The sum of divisors of $n$, $\\sigma(n)$, is given by $\\sigma(n) = \\sigma(2^{p-1})\\sigma(2^p - 1)$. Since $2^p - 1$ is prime, $\\sigma(2^p - 1) = 2^p$. Also, $\\sigma(2^{p-1}) = 1 + 2 + 2^2 + \\cdots + 2^{p-1} = 2^p - 1$. Thus, $\\sigma(n) = (2^p - 1) \\cdot 2^p = 2 \\cdot 2^{p-1}(2^p - 1) = 2n$, proving $n$ is perfect.\n\n## Step 10: Outline the proof that every even perfect number is of the form $2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$.\nLet $n$ be an even perfect number. Then $n = 2^k \\cdot m$, where $m$ is odd. Since $n$ is perfect, $\\sigma(n) = 2n$. Using the multiplicative property of $\\sigma$, we have $\\sigma(n) = \\sigma(2^k)\\sigma(m) = (2^{k+1} - 1)\\sigma(m)$. Thus, $(2^{k+1} - 1)\\sigma(m) = 2^{k+1}m$. This implies $2^{k+1} - 1$ divides $m$, so $m = (2^{k+1} - 1)d$ for some $d$. Substituting back gives $\\sigma(m) = 2^{k+1}d$. For $d = 1$, $m = 2^{k+1} - 1$ is prime, and $\\sigma(m) = m + 1 = 2^{k+1}$, which matches our requirement. For $d > 1$, it leads to a contradiction because $\\sigma(m) \\geq m + d > 2d$, unless $d = 1$ and $m$ is prime.\n\n## Step 11: Conclude the solution.\nThe given statement is a direct consequence of the Euclid-Euler theorem, which characterizes even perfect numbers.\n\nThe final answer is: \n\nProve that if $n$ is an even perfect number, then $n = 2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$, where $2^p - 1$ is a Mersenne prime.",
