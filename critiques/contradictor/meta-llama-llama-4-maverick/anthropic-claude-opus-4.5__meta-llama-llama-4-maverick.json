It encompasses topics such as permutations, combinations, graph theory, and more.\n\n## Step 3: Generate a problem\nTo create a challenging problem, let's consider a topic within Combinatorics that is both interesting and requires substantial reasoning. A potential topic is graph theory, specifically focusing on graph coloring or connectivity.\n\n## Step 4: Formulate the problem\nLet's formulate a problem: \"Prove that in any simple graph with $n$ vertices, if the graph is connected and has no cycles (i.e., it's a tree), then it has exactly $n-1$ edges.\"\n\n## Step 5: Verify the problem against the quality rubric\n- **Well-Posedness and Completeness**: The problem is self-contained, defines the necessary terms (simple graph, connected, no cycles, tree), and asks for a proof.\n- **Clarity**: The terms used are standard in graph theory, and the task is clear.\n- **Non-Triviality**: The problem requires understanding of graph theory and a proof involving induction or another suitable method, making it non-trivial.\n- **Solvability and Verification**: The statement is a known fact in graph theory and can be proven using established methods.\n\n## Step 6: Provide the solution\nTo solve this, we can use induction on $n$. For $n=1$, a tree has 0 edges, and $1-1=0$, so the statement holds. For $n>1$, assume the statement is true for all trees with fewer than $n$ vertices. A tree with $n$ vertices has at least one leaf (a vertex of degree 1); removing this leaf and its edge gives a tree with $n-1$ vertices. By the induction hypothesis, this smaller tree has $(n-1)-1 = n-2$ edges. Adding back the removed edge gives $n-2 + 1 = n-1$ edges, proving the statement for $n$.\n\n## Step 7: Format the output\nLet's format the problem and solution according to the required structure.\n\n\nLet $G$ be a simple graph with $n$ vertices.

The problem must be well-posed, clear, non-trivial, and solvable with established mathematical methods.\n\n## Step 2: Identify a suitable topic within number theory.\nNumber theory encompasses various topics such as divisibility, prime numbers, congruences, and Diophantine equations. A challenging problem could involve proving a property related to prime numbers or solving a specific type of Diophantine equation.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a problem that meets the criteria.\nLet's consider a problem involving the sum of divisors of a number and its relation to perfect numbers. A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors, excluding the number itself.\n\n## Step 4: Specify the problem.\nConsider the following problem: \"Prove that if $n$ is an even perfect number, then $n = 2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$, where $2^p - 1$ is a Mersenne prime.\"\n\n## Step 5: Provide the solution to the problem.\nTo solve this, we need to understand the definition of an even perfect number and its relation to Mersenne primes.\n\n## Step 6: Recall the definition and properties of even perfect numbers.\nAn even perfect number $n$ can be written as $n = 2^{k-1}(2^k - 1)$, where $2^k - 1$ is prime. This is known as the Euclid-Euler theorem.\n\n## Step 7: State the Euclid-Euler theorem.\nThe Euclid-Euler theorem states that every even perfect number is of the form $2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$, where $2^p - 1$ is a Mersenne prime (i.e., $2^p - 1$ is prime).\n\n## Step 8: Provide the proof or reasoning for the given statement.\nThe proof involves two main parts: (1) showing that any number of the form $2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$, where $2^p - 1$ is prime, is perfect, and (2) showing that every even perfect number is of this form.\n\n## Step 9: Outline the proof that $2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$ is perfect when $2^p - 1$ is prime.\nLet $n = 2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$. The sum of divisors of $n$, $\\sigma(n)$, is given by $\\sigma(n) = \\sigma(2^{p-1})\\sigma(2^p - 1)$. Since $2^p - 1$ is prime, $\\sigma(2^p - 1) = 2^p$. Also, $\\sigma(2^{p-1}) = 1 + 2 + 2^2 + \\cdots + 2^{p-1} = 2^p - 1$. Thus, $\\sigma(n) = (2^p - 1) \\cdot 2^p = 2 \\cdot 2^{p-1}(2^p - 1) = 2n$, proving $n$ is perfect.\n\n## Step 10: Outline the proof that every even perfect number is of the form $2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$.\nLet $n$ be an even perfect number. Then $n = 2^k \\cdot m$, where $m$ is odd. Since $n$ is perfect, $\\sigma(n) = 2n$. Using the multiplicative property of $\\sigma$, we have $\\sigma(n) = \\sigma(2^k)\\sigma(m) = (2^{k+1} - 1)\\sigma(m)$. Thus, $(2^{k+1} - 1)\\sigma(m) = 2^{k+1}m$. This implies $2^{k+1} - 1$ divides $m$, so $m = (2^{k+1} - 1)d$ for some $d$. Substituting back gives $\\sigma(m) = 2^{k+1}d$. For $d = 1$, $m = 2^{k+1} - 1$ is prime, and $\\sigma(m) = m + 1 = 2^{k+1}$, which matches our requirement. For $d > 1$, it leads to a contradiction because $\\sigma(m) \\geq m + d > 2d$, unless $d = 1$ and $m$ is prime.\n\n## Step 11: Conclude the solution.\nThe given statement is a direct consequence of the Euclid-Euler theorem, which characterizes even perfect numbers.\n\nThe final answer is: \n\nProve that if $n$ is an even perfect number, then $n = 2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$, where $2^p - 1$ is a Mersenne prime.",

Prove that $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.\"\n\n## Step 5: Verify the problem meets the quality rubric\n- **Well-Posedness and Completeness**: The problem is fully specified with $G$ being a finite group and $H$ a subgroup of $G$, and the condition $|G| = 2|H|$ is given.\n- **Clarity**: The terms are standard in group theory, and the task is clear.\n- **Non-Triviality**: The problem requires understanding of group theory and the concept of normal subgroups, making it non-trivial.\n- **Solvability and Verification**: The problem is solvable using established methods in group theory.\n\n## Step 6: Provide the solution\nTo prove that $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$, we need to show that for any $g \\in G$ and $h \\in H$, $g^{-1}hg \\in H$.\n\n## Step 7: Break down the solution\nFirst, note that since $|G| = 2|H|$, $H$ has index 2 in $G$. This implies there are exactly two cosets of $H$ in $G$: $H$ itself and $G \\setminus H$.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze cosets\nFor any $g \\in G$, if $g \\in H$, then $gH = H$ and $Hg = H$, so $gH = Hg$. If $g \\notin H$, then $gH = G \\setminus H$ because there are only two cosets and $gH$ cannot be $H$. Similarly, $Hg = G \\setminus H$, so again $gH = Hg$.\n\n## Step 9: Conclude normality\nSince $gH = Hg$ for all $g \\in G$, $H$ is normal in $G$.\n\n## Step 10: Write the problem and solution in the required format\n\nLet $G$ be a finite group and $H$ be a subgroup of $G$. Suppose that $|G| = 2|H|$. Prove that $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.",

    "question": "## Step 1: Understand the task\nThe task is to generate a challenging mathematics problem in the domain of commutative algebra, along with a complete and verifiable solution. The problem must be well-posed, clear, non-trivial, and solvable with established mathematical methods.\n\n## Step 2: Identify a suitable topic in commutative algebra\nCommutative algebra involves the study of commutative rings and their ideals, modules, and algebras. A challenging problem could involve understanding the properties of ideals, quotient rings, or the behavior of polynomials over certain rings.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a specific problem\nLet's consider a problem involving the properties of ideals in a polynomial ring. Specifically, we can examine the ideal generated by a set of polynomials and ask questions about its properties, such as whether it is prime or maximal.\n\n## Step 4: Construct the problem\nConsider the polynomial ring $\\mathbb{Q}[x, y]$ and the ideal $I = (x^2 + y^2, xy)$. We can ask: Is the ideal $I$ prime? To make it more challenging and ensure it's well-posed, we can ask to determine whether $I$ is radical, i.e., whether it is equal to its radical $\\sqrt{I}$.\n\n## Step 5: Write down the problem statement\nLet $I = (x^2 + y^2, xy)$ be an ideal in $\\mathbb{Q}[x, y]$. Determine whether $I = \\sqrt{I}$, where $\\sqrt{I} = \\{f \\in \\mathbb{Q}[x, y] \\mid f^n \\in I \\text{ for some } n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$.\n\n## Step 6: Provide the solution\nTo determine if $I = \\sqrt{I}$, we first need to understand what $\\sqrt{I}$ is. An element $f \\in \\mathbb{Q}[x, y]$ is in $\\sqrt{I}$ if $f^n \\in I$ for some $n$. We need to check if there are elements in $\\sqrt{I}$ that are not in $I$.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze the ideal $I$\nTo check if $I = \\sqrt{I}$, let's first examine the quotient ring $\\mathbb{Q}[x, y]/I$. The ideal $I$ contains $x^2 + y^2$ and $xy$, which implies that $x^2 + y^2$ and $xy$ are zero in $\\mathbb{Q}[x, y]/I$. We can simplify this by observing that $x^2y + y^3 = 0$ and $x^2y = 0$ in $\\mathbb{Q}[x, y]/I$, implying $y^3 = 0$ in $\\mathbb{Q}[x, y]/I$. Similarly, $x^3 = 0$.\n\n## Step 8: Check if $I$ is radical\nSince $x^3 = 0$ and $y^3 = 0$ in $\\mathbb{Q}[x, y]/I$, it follows that $x, y \\in \\sqrt{I}$ because $x^3, y^3 \\in I$. We need to verify if $x$ and $y$ are in $I$. If not, then $I \\neq \\sqrt{I}$.\n\n## Step 9: Verify if $x$ and $y$ are in $I$\nTo check if $x \\in I$, we need to see if there exist $f, g \\in \\mathbb{Q}[x, y]$ such that $x = f(x^2 + y^2) + g(xy)$. This simplifies to checking if $x$ can be expressed as a combination of $x^2 + y^2$ and $xy$, which is not possible because any element in $I$ is of degree at least 2.\n\n## Step 10: Conclude on $I = \\sqrt{I}$\nSince $x, y \\in \\sqrt{I}$ but $x, y \\notin I$, it follows that $I \\neq \\sqrt{I}$. Thus, $I$ is not radical.\n\nThe final answer is: \n\nLet $I = (x^2 + y^2, xy)$ be an ideal in $\\mathbb{Q}[x, y]$. Determine whether $I = \\sqrt{I}$, where $\\sqrt{I} = \\{f \\in \\mathbb{Q}[x, y] \\mid f^n \\in I \\text{ for some } n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$.",

The problem should be well-posed, clear, non-trivial, and solvable with established mathematical methods.\n\n## Step 2: Identify a suitable topic within algebraic geometry\nAlgebraic geometry is a broad field that involves the study of geometric objects, such as varieties and schemes, using tools from abstract algebra. A suitable topic could involve the study of curves, surfaces, or higher-dimensional varieties, and their properties.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a specific problem\nLet's consider a problem involving the intersection of curves on a surface. A classic result in algebraic geometry is B\u00e9zout's theorem, which describes the intersection of two curves on a projective plane. We can formulate a problem related to this.\n\n## Step 4: State the problem\nConsider two curves $C_1$ and $C_2$ on $\\mathbb{P}^2$, defined by homogeneous polynomials $f(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 - z^2$ and $g(x,y,z) = xy - z^2$, respectively. Find the number of intersection points of $C_1$ and $C_2$ in $\\mathbb{P}^2$, counted with multiplicity.\n\n## Step 5: Provide the solution\nTo find the intersection points, we need to solve the system of equations given by $f(x,y,z) = 0$ and $g(x,y,z) = 0$. This means we have to solve $x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = 0$ and $xy - z^2 = 0$ simultaneously.\n\n## Step 6: Solve the system of equations\nFirst, from $xy - z^2 = 0$, we can express $z^2 = xy$. Substituting $z^2$ into the first equation gives $x^2 + y^2 - xy = 0$. This is a homogeneous equation in $x$ and $y$, which can be solved by considering it as a quadratic form.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze the quadratic form\nThe equation $x^2 - xy + y^2 = 0$ can be analyzed by finding its roots. This is equivalent to solving $x^2 - xy + y^2 = 0$ for $x$ in terms of $y$ (or vice versa), treating it as a quadratic equation.\n\n## Step 8: Solve for $x$ in terms of $y$\nUsing the quadratic formula, $x = \\frac{y \\pm \\sqrt{y^2 - 4y^2}}{2} = \\frac{y \\pm \\sqrt{-3y^2}}{2}$. For $y \\neq 0$, this simplifies to $x = \\frac{y(1 \\pm i\\sqrt{3})}{2}$. Thus, $x = y\\omega$ or $x = y\\omega^2$, where $\\omega$ is a primitive third root of unity.\n\n## Step 9: Determine the intersection points\nFor $x = y\\omega$ and $x = y\\omega^2$, substituting back into $xy = z^2$ gives $y^2\\omega = z^2$ and $y^2\\omega^2 = z^2$, respectively. This implies $z = \\pm y\\sqrt{\\omega}$ and $z = \\pm y\\sqrt{\\omega^2}$. However, we must consider the projective nature and the fact that we're working with homogeneous coordinates.\n\n## Step 10: Count the intersection points with multiplicity\nSince $\\omega$ and $\\omega^2$ are not real, and we're working over $\\mathbb{C}$, we need to consider the solutions in $\\mathbb{P}^2(\\mathbb{C})$. The solutions are given by the pairs $(x:y:z)$ satisfying both equations. We need to check if there are any solutions where $y = 0$, which would imply $x = 0$ and thus $z = 0$, but $(0,0,0)$ is not a valid point in $\\mathbb{P}^2$.\n\n## Step 11: Apply B\u00e9zout's theorem for a simpler solution\nB\u00e9zout's theorem states that two curves of degrees $d_1$ and $d_2$ intersect in $d_1d_2$ points, counted with multiplicity, if they have no common components. Here, $C_1$ and $C_2$ are both of degree 2, so they should intersect in $2 \\times 2 = 4$ points.\n\nThe final answer is: \n\nConsider two curves $C_1$ and $C_2$ on $\\mathbb{P}^2$, defined by homogeneous polynomials $f(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 - z^2$ and $g(x,y,z) = xy - z^2$, respectively.

    "question": "## Step 1: Understand the task and the domain\nThe task is to generate a challenging but solvable mathematics problem in the domain of associative rings and algebras, along with a complete and verifiable solution. The problem should be well-posed, clear, non-trivial, and solvable with established mathematical methods.\n\n## Step 2: Identify a suitable topic within associative rings and algebras\nAssociative rings and algebras involve the study of algebraic structures with associative multiplication. A suitable topic could involve properties of ideals, quotient rings, or specific types of algebras like matrix algebras.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a problem\nLet's consider a problem involving the properties of a specific type of associative algebra. For instance, we could explore the characteristics of a matrix algebra over a ring.\n\n## Step 4: Generate a specific problem\nConsider the ring $R = \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ and the matrix algebra $M_2(R)$ of $2 \\times 2$ matrices with entries in $R$. Let's examine the properties of ideals in $M_2(R)$.\n\n## Step 5: Formulate the problem statement\n\"Let $R = \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ and consider the matrix algebra $M_2(R)$. Prove that $M_2(R)$ is not a simple ring, i.e., it has a non-trivial ideal.\"\n\n## Step 6: Provide the solution\nTo solve this, we need to show that there exists a non-trivial ideal in $M_2(R)$. An ideal $I$ in $M_2(R)$ is a subset that is closed under addition and under multiplication by any element of $M_2(R)$ from either side.\n\n## Step 7: Identify a non-trivial ideal\nConsider the set $I$ of matrices in $M_2(R)$ where all entries are even (i.e., $0$ or $2$ mod $4$). This set is non-empty and not equal to $M_2(R)$ because it does not contain matrices with odd entries.\n\n## Step 8: Verify that $I$ is an ideal\nFor $I$ to be an ideal, it must be closed under addition and under multiplication by elements of $M_2(R)$. For any two matrices $A, B \\in I$, $A + B$ has even entries because the sum of even numbers is even, so $A + B \\in I$. For any $A \\in I$ and $C \\in M_2(R)$, the product $CA$ and $AC$ will have entries that are products and sums of products involving elements of $R$. Since $A$ has even entries, $CA$ and $AC$ will also have even entries because multiplying any element of $R$ by an even element results in an even element.\n\n## Step 9: Check if $I$ is non-trivial\n$I$ is non-trivial if it is not the zero ideal and not the entire ring $M_2(R)$. The zero matrix is in $I$, and there are non-zero matrices in $I$ (e.g., $\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$), so $I$ is not the zero ideal. $I$ is not $M_2(R)$ because, for example, $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\notin I$.\n\n## Step 10: Conclude the solution\nSince $I$ is a non-trivial ideal, $M_2(R)$ is not a simple ring.\n\nThe final answer is: \n\nLet $R = \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ and consider the matrix algebra $M_2(R)$. Prove that $M_2(R)$ is not a simple ring, i.e., it has a non-trivial ideal.",

    "question": "## Step 1: Understand the task and the domain\nThe task is to generate a challenging but solvable mathematics problem in the domain of \"Group theory and generalizations\" along with a complete and verifiable solution. The problem should be well-posed, clear, non-trivial, and solvable with established mathematical methods.\n\n## Step 2: Identify a suitable topic within Group theory and generalizations\nGroup theory is a branch of abstract algebra that studies the symmetric aspects of objects and the transformations that preserve those symmetries. A suitable topic could involve properties of groups, such as subgroup structures, homomorphisms, or specific types of groups like cyclic or symmetric groups.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a challenging problem\nTo create a challenging problem, we can consider a topic like the classification of groups or the study of group homomorphisms. A potential problem could involve determining the number of homomorphisms between two given groups or analyzing the structure of a specific group.\n\n## Step 4: Generate a specific problem\nLet's consider the problem of finding the number of homomorphisms from the cyclic group of order 12, $\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$, to the symmetric group $S_3$. This involves understanding the structure of both groups and applying knowledge about homomorphisms.\n\n## Step 5: State the problem formally\nThe problem can be stated as: \"Let $\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ be the cyclic group of order 12 and $S_3$ be the symmetric group on 3 elements. Determine the number of homomorphisms from $\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ to $S_3$.\"\n\n## Step 6: Provide the solution\nTo solve this, we need to understand that a homomorphism $f: \\mathbb{Z}_{12} \\to S_3$ is determined by $f(1)$, where $1$ is a generator of $\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$. The element $f(1)$ must have an order that divides 12. $S_3$ has elements of orders 1, 2, and 3. We need to count how many elements in $S_3$ have orders that divide 12.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze the elements of $S_3$\n$S_3 = \\{e, (12), (13), (23), (123), (132)\\}$. The identity $e$ has order 1, the transpositions $(12), (13), (23)$ have order 2, and the 3-cycles $(123), (132)$ have order 3. The orders of elements in $S_3$ that divide 12 are 1, 2, and 3.\n\n## Step 8: Count the possible images of $1 \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$\nThere is 1 element of order 1, 3 elements of order 2, and 2 elements of order 3. So, $f(1)$ can be any of these 6 elements because their orders divide 12.\n\n## Step 9: Conclude the number of homomorphisms\nSince $f(1)$ can be any of the 6 elements (1 of order 1, 3 of order 2, and 2 of order 3), there are 6 possible homomorphisms from $\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ to $S_3$.\n\n## Step 10: Format the problem and solution according to the required output format\n\nLet $\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ be the cyclic group of order 12 and $S_3$ be the symmetric group on 3 elements. Determine the number of homomorphisms from $\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ to $S_3$.",

The problem must be well-posed, clear, non-trivial, and solvable with established mathematical methods.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the specific area within real functions to focus on.\nGiven the broad domain of real functions, we can consider various aspects such as differentiation, integration, functional equations, or properties of specific types of functions (e.g., continuous, differentiable, integrable).\n\n## Step 3: Choose a specific topic within real functions that can be used to create a challenging problem.\nLet's consider the topic of functional equations, which involves finding a function that satisfies a given equation involving the function and its inputs.\n\n## Step 4: Generate a challenging problem in the chosen topic.\nConsider the functional equation $f(x + y) = \\frac{f(x) + f(y)}{1 - f(x)f(y)}$ for $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$, where $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$. The task is to find all $f$ that satisfy this equation.\n\n## Step 5: Ensure the problem is well-posed and meets the quality rubric.\nThe given functional equation is well-defined, and the task is clear. We need to verify that it's non-trivial and solvable.\n\n## Step 6: Provide a solution to the generated problem.\nTo solve $f(x + y) = \\frac{f(x) + f(y)}{1 - f(x)f(y)}$, let's first check if there are any obvious solutions. For $y = 0$, we get $f(x) = \\frac{f(x) + f(0)}{1 - f(x)f(0)}$. This simplifies to $f(x)(1 - f(x)f(0)) = f(x) + f(0)$, or $f(x) - f(x)^2f(0) = f(x) + f(0)$, leading to $-f(x)^2f(0) = f(0)$. If $f(0) \\neq 0$, this gives $f(x)^2 = -1$ for all $x$, which is impossible for real-valued $f$. Thus, $f(0) = 0$.\n\n## Step 7: Continue solving the functional equation.\nSetting $y = x$, we have $f(2x) = \\frac{2f(x)}{1 - f(x)^2}$. This is a useful relation but let's first explore the derivative of $f$ if it exists. Assuming $f$ is differentiable, differentiating both sides with respect to $y$ and then setting $y = 0$ gives $f'(x) = \\frac{f'(0)(1 + f(x)^2)}{(1 - f(x)f(0))^2} = f'(0)(1 + f(x)^2)$ because $f(0) = 0$. So, $f'(x) = f'(0)(1 + f(x)^2)$.\n\n## Step 8: Solve the differential equation obtained from the functional equation.\nThe differential equation $f'(x) = f'(0)(1 + f(x)^2)$ can be solved by separation of variables: $\\frac{df}{1 + f^2} = f'(0)dx$. Integrating both sides gives $\\arctan(f(x)) = f'(0)x + C$, where $C$ is a constant. Since $f(0) = 0$, we have $C = 0$. Thus, $f(x) = \\tan(f'(0)x)$.\n\n## Step 9: Verify that the solution satisfies the original functional equation.\nSubstituting $f(x) = \\tan(f'(0)x)$ into the original equation: $\\tan(f'(0)(x+y)) = \\frac{\\tan(f'(0)x) + \\tan(f'(0)y)}{1 - \\tan(f'(0)x)\\tan(f'(0)y)}$, which is a known trigonometric identity, thus verifying that $f(x) = \\tan(f'(0)x)$ is a solution.\n\n## Step 10: Check if there are any constraints on $f'(0)$.\nFor $f(x) = \\tan(f'(0)x)$ to be defined for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $f'(0)$ must be $0$, otherwise, $f(x)$ will have discontinuities. If $f'(0) = 0$, then $f(x) = 0$ for all $x$, which is indeed a solution.\n\n## Step 11: Formulate the final problem and solution.\nLet's formulate the problem: \"Find all $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy $f(x + y) = \\frac{f(x) + f(y)}{1 - f(x)f(y)}$ for all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\"\n\n\nFind all $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy $f(x + y) = \\frac{f(x) + f(y)}{1 - f(x)f(y)}$ for all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.",

    "question": "## Step 1: Understand the task and the domain\nThe task is to generate a challenging but solvable mathematics problem in the domain of Potential theory, along with a complete and verifiable solution. Potential theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of potentials and their properties, particularly in relation to partial differential equations, especially Laplace's equation.\n\n## Step 2: Identify key concepts in Potential theory\nPotential theory involves the study of harmonic functions, potentials (such as Newtonian or logarithmic potentials), and their applications. Key concepts include the Laplace equation ($\\Delta u = 0$), Poisson's equation ($\\Delta u = f$), and boundary value problems (Dirichlet and Neumann problems).\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a problem\nTo create a challenging problem, we need to involve some of the advanced concepts or techniques from Potential theory. Let's consider a problem involving the Dirichlet problem for the Laplace equation on a specific domain.\n\n## Step 4: Specify the problem\nLet's consider the following problem: \"Let $D = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2: |x| < 1\\}$ be the unit disk in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Find the solution $u(x)$ to the Dirichlet problem $\\Delta u = 0$ in $D$, $u(x) = \\log|x - (1,0)|$ on $\\partial D$.\"\n\n## Step 5: Provide the solution\nTo solve this problem, we can use the Poisson integral formula, which gives the solution to the Dirichlet problem on the unit disk. The Poisson integral formula is given by $u(x) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{\\partial D} \\frac{1 - |x|^2}{|x - y|^2} f(y) ds(y)$, where $f(y)$ is the boundary data.\n\n## Step 6: Apply the Poisson integral formula\nFor $x = (r\\cos\\theta, r\\sin\\theta)$ and $y = (\\cos\\phi, \\sin\\phi)$, we have $|x - y|^2 = r^2 - 2r\\cos(\\theta - \\phi) + 1$ and $ds(y) = d\\phi$. The boundary data is $f(y) = \\log|y - (1,0)| = \\log\\sqrt{2 - 2\\cos\\phi}$. So, $u(x) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{1 - r^2}{r^2 - 2r\\cos(\\theta - \\phi) + 1} \\log\\sqrt{2 - 2\\cos\\phi} d\\phi$.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the integral\nThe integral can be simplified by recognizing that $\\log\\sqrt{2 - 2\\cos\\phi} = \\log|1 - e^{i\\phi}| = \\log|1 - e^{i\\phi}| = \\Re(\\log(1 - e^{i\\phi}))$. However, directly evaluating this integral is complex and typically involves recognizing it as a special case that can be related to the properties of harmonic functions and the Poisson kernel.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluate the solution using properties of harmonic functions\nFor $x \\in D$, the solution can be found by directly applying properties of harmonic functions and recognizing that the given boundary condition corresponds to a specific harmonic function. The function $u(x) = \\log|x - (1,0)|$ is harmonic in $D$ except at $x = (1,0)$, which is outside $D$ since $|1,0| = 1$ is on $\\partial D$. Thus, we directly check if $u(x)$ satisfies the given boundary condition and is harmonic.\n\n## Step 9: Check if the given boundary data directly provides the solution\nSince $\\log|x - (1,0)|$ is harmonic in $D$ and equals $\\log|y - (1,0)|$ on $\\partial D$, it is the solution to the Dirichlet problem.\n\nThe final answer is: \n\nLet $D = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2: |x| < 1\\}$ be the unit disk in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Find the solution $u(x)$ to the Dirichlet problem $\\Delta u = 0$ in $D$, $u(x) = \\log|x - (1,0)|$ on $\\partial D$.",

    "question": "## Step 1: Understand the task and the domain\nThe task is to generate a challenging but solvable mathematics problem in the domain of \"Several complex variables and analytic spaces\" along with a complete and verifiable solution. The problem should be well-posed, clear, non-trivial, and solvable with established mathematical methods.\n\n## Step 2: Identify key concepts in the domain\nSeveral complex variables and analytic spaces involve the study of functions of multiple complex variables and the spaces on which these functions are defined. Key concepts include holomorphic functions, complex manifolds, analytic continuation, and various types of domains (e.g., domains of holomorphy, pseudoconvex domains).\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a problem\nTo create a problem, we need to focus on a specific aspect of several complex variables. Let's consider the concept of holomorphic functions on a domain in $\\mathbb{C}^n$. A potential problem could involve characterizing or analyzing the properties of such functions.\n\n## Step 4: Specify the problem\nLet's formulate a problem related to the extension of holomorphic functions. A well-known result in several complex variables is the Hartogs' extension theorem, which states that any holomorphic function defined on a domain in $\\mathbb{C}^n$ ($n > 1$) with a compact hole can be extended holomorphically to the whole domain. We can create a problem related to this concept.\n\n## Step 5: Create the problem statement\nConsider the domain $\\Omega = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}^2 : |z_1| < 1, |z_2| < 1\\}$ and the subset $S = \\{z \\in \\Omega : |z_1| < \\frac{1}{2}\\}$. Let $f$ be a holomorphic function on $\\Omega \\setminus S$. Show that $f$ can be extended to a holomorphic function on $\\Omega$.\n\n## Step 6: Provide the solution\nTo solve this, we recognize that $\\Omega \\setminus S$ is not a compact hole in $\\Omega$, so we cannot directly apply Hartogs' theorem. However, we can analyze the problem by considering the properties of holomorphic functions in $\\mathbb{C}^2$ and the specific geometry of $\\Omega$ and $S$.\n\n## Step 7: Detail the solution\nFor $z = (z_1, z_2) \\in \\Omega \\setminus S$, $f(z)$ is holomorphic. We need to show that $f$ can be extended holomorphically to $\\Omega$. For any fixed $z_2$ with $|z_2| < 1$, $f(z_1, z_2)$ is holomorphic in $z_1$ for $\\frac{1}{2} \\leq |z_1| < 1$. By the principle of analytic continuation in one variable, if $f(z_1, z_2)$ is holomorphic for $|z_1| < 1$ except on a smaller disk, it can be extended. However, the direct application of Hartogs' theorem is not possible here due to the shape of $S$. Instead, we can use the fact that for each $z_2$, $f(\\cdot, z_2)$ can be extended to $|z_1| < 1$ because the singularity set is contained within $|z_1| \\leq \\frac{1}{2}$, and then apply Hartogs' theorem or a similar principle to conclude the extension is holomorphic in both variables.\n\n## Step 8: Write the problem and solution in the required format\n\nLet $\\Omega = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}^2 : |z_1| < 1, |z_2| < 1\\}$ and $S = \\{z \\in \\Omega : |z_1| < \\frac{1}{2}\\}$. Suppose $f$ is a holomorphic function on $\\Omega \\setminus S$. Prove that $f$ can be extended to a holomorphic function on $\\Omega$.",

    "question": "## Step 1: Understand the task\nThe task is to generate a challenging but solvable mathematics problem in the domain of dynamical systems and ergodic theory, along with a complete and verifiable solution.\n\n## Step 2: Identify key concepts in dynamical systems and ergodic theory\nDynamical systems involve the study of the behavior of systems that change over time according to certain rules. Ergodic theory is a branch of mathematics that studies the behavior of dynamical systems over time, focusing on their statistical properties. Key concepts include ergodicity, measure-preserving transformations, and the ergodic theorem.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a problem\nTo create a problem, we need to incorporate concepts from dynamical systems and ergodic theory. A potential problem could involve analyzing the behavior of a specific dynamical system, such as determining if it is ergodic or calculating its invariant measures.\n\n## Step 4: Specify the problem\nLet's consider a simple yet challenging example: the rotation map on the unit circle. The unit circle can be represented as $\\mathbb{T} = \\mathbb{R}/\\mathbb{Z}$, and a rotation map $T: \\mathbb{T} \\to \\mathbb{T}$ is defined by $T(x) = x + \\alpha \\mod 1$, where $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n## Step 5: Formulate the question\nWe can ask whether the rotation map $T$ is ergodic with respect to the Lebesgue measure on $\\mathbb{T}$ when $\\alpha$ is irrational.\n\n## Step 6: Write the problem statement\n\"Let $T: \\mathbb{T} \\to \\mathbb{T}$ be defined by $T(x) = x + \\alpha \\mod 1$, where $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is irrational. Prove that $T$ is ergodic with respect to the Lebesgue measure on $\\mathbb{T}$.\"\n\n## Step 7: Provide the solution\nTo prove that $T$ is ergodic, we need to show that if $A \\subset \\mathbb{T}$ is $T$-invariant (i.e., $T(A) = A$) and measurable, then either $m(A) = 0$ or $m(A) = 1$, where $m$ denotes the Lebesgue measure.\n\n## Step 8: Detail the solution\nFirst, recall that $T$ is measure-preserving because $m(T^{-1}(A)) = m(A)$ for any measurable $A \\subset \\mathbb{T}$. For $T$ to be ergodic, we must show that $T$-invariant sets have measure 0 or 1.\n\n## Step 9: Use Fourier analysis to prove ergodicity\nConsider a $T$-invariant set $A$. The characteristic function $\\chi_A$ of $A$ is $T$-invariant, meaning $\\chi_A(T(x)) = \\chi_A(x)$. We can expand $\\chi_A$ in a Fourier series: $\\chi_A(x) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} c_n e^{2\\pi inx}$, where $c_n = \\int_{\\mathbb{T}} \\chi_A(x)e^{-2\\pi inx} dx$.\n\n## Step 10: Apply $T$-invariance to the Fourier series\nSince $\\chi_A(T(x)) = \\chi_A(x + \\alpha) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} c_n e^{2\\pi in(x + \\alpha)} = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} c_n e^{2\\pi in\\alpha}e^{2\\pi inx}$, and this equals $\\chi_A(x)$, we have $c_n = c_n e^{2\\pi in\\alpha}$ for all $n$. For $\\alpha$ irrational, $e^{2\\pi in\\alpha} \\neq 1$ unless $n = 0$. Thus, $c_n = 0$ for $n \\neq 0$.\n\n## Step 11: Conclude ergodicity from the Fourier analysis\nThis implies $\\chi_A(x) = c_0 = \\int_{\\mathbb{T}} \\chi_A(x) dx = m(A)$, meaning $\\chi_A$ is constant. Hence, $A$ is either $\\mathbb{T}$ (if $m(A) = 1$) or $\\emptyset$ (if $m(A) = 0$), proving $T$ is ergodic.\n\n## Step 12: Format the question and answer according to the required structure\n\nLet $T: \\mathbb{T} \\to \\mathbb{T}$ be defined by $T(x) = x + \\alpha \\mod 1$, where $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is irrational. Prove that $T$ is ergodic with respect to the Lebesgue measure on $\\mathbb{T}$.",

It should be fully specified, with clear notation and constraints.\n\n## Step 3: Generate a problem\nLet's generate a problem: \"Find all functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the functional equation $f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) + xy$ for all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$, and $f(1) = 1$.\"\n\n## Step 4: Verify that the generated problem meets the quality rubric\n- **Well-Posedness and Completeness**: The problem is fully self-contained, with the domain and codomain of $f$ specified, and the functional equation given.\n- **Clarity**: The notation is standard, and the task is clear.\n- **Non-Triviality**: The problem requires solving a functional equation, which is non-trivial.\n- **Solvability and Verification**: The problem is solvable using established methods for functional equations.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the generated problem\nTo solve $f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) + xy$, let's first try substituting specific values for $x$ and $y$ to derive additional information.\n\n## Step 6: Substitute $x = y = 0$ into the equation\n$f(0 + 0) = f(0) + f(0) + 0 \\cdot 0$ simplifies to $f(0) = 2f(0)$, which implies $f(0) = 0$.\n\n## Step 7: Substitute $y = 1$ into the original equation\n$f(x + 1) = f(x) + f(1) + x = f(x) + x + 1$, since $f(1) = 1$.

    "question": "## Step 1: Understand the task and the domain\nThe task is to generate a challenging mathematics problem in the domain of \"Integral transforms, operational calculus\" along with a complete and verifiable solution. The problem should be well-posed, clear, non-trivial, and solvable with established mathematical methods.\n\n## Step 2: Choose a specific topic within the domain\nLet's focus on the Laplace transform, a key concept within integral transforms and operational calculus. The Laplace transform is defined as $\\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st}f(t)dt = F(s)$, where $f(t)$ is a function defined for $t \\geq 0$.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a challenging problem\nTo create a challenging problem, we can consider applying the Laplace transform to solve a differential equation, as this involves understanding both the transform and its inverse. A suitable problem could involve solving an initial value problem (IVP) using the Laplace transform.\n\n## Step 4: Specify the problem\nLet's consider the following IVP: $y'' + 4y = \\sin(2t)$, with initial conditions $y(0) = 0$ and $y'(0) = 0$. The task is to solve for $y(t)$ using the Laplace transform.\n\n## Step 5: Write the problem statement\n\nUse the Laplace transform to solve the initial value problem $y'' + 4y = \\sin(2t)$, where $y(0) = 0$ and $y'(0) = 0$.\n\n## Step 6: Provide the solution\nTo solve the given IVP using the Laplace transform, we first apply the Laplace transform to both sides of the differential equation.\n\n## Step 7: Apply the Laplace transform to the differential equation\n$\\mathcal{L}\\{y'' + 4y\\} = \\mathcal{L}\\{\\sin(2t)\\}$. Using linearity, we get $\\mathcal{L}\\{y''\\} + 4\\mathcal{L}\\{y\\} = \\mathcal{L}\\{\\sin(2t)\\}$.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluate the Laplace transforms\n$\\mathcal{L}\\{y''\\} = s^2Y(s) - sy(0) - y'(0)$ and $\\mathcal{L}\\{y\\} = Y(s)$, where $Y(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{y(t)\\}$. Given $y(0) = 0$ and $y'(0) = 0$, $\\mathcal{L}\\{y''\\} = s^2Y(s)$. $\\mathcal{L}\\{\\sin(2t)\\} = \\frac{2}{s^2 + 4}$.\n\n## Step 9: Substitute the known values and simplify\n$s^2Y(s) + 4Y(s) = \\frac{2}{s^2 + 4}$. Thus, $Y(s)(s^2 + 4) = \\frac{2}{s^2 + 4}$, which simplifies to $Y(s) = \\frac{2}{(s^2 + 4)^2}$.\n\n## Step 10: Find the inverse Laplace transform of $Y(s)$\nTo find $y(t)$, we need $\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{Y(s)\\} = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{2}{(s^2 + 4)^2}\\right\\}$. Recall that $\\mathcal{L}\\{\\sin(at)\\} = \\frac{a}{s^2 + a^2}$, and use the property that $\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{F(s)\\} = f(t)$ implies $\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{d}{ds}F(s)\\right\\} = -tf(t)$, or more directly, utilize the convolution or known transforms.\n\n## Step 11: Evaluate the inverse Laplace transform\nUsing the formula for $\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{2a^3}{(s^2 + a^2)^2}\\right\\} = \\sin(at) - at\\cos(at)$ with $a = 2$, we adjust for our case: $\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{2}{(s^2 + 4)^2}\\right\\} = \\frac{1}{4}\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{2 \\cdot 2^3}{(s^2 + 2^2)^2}\\right\\} = \\frac{1}{4}(\\sin(2t) - 2t\\cos(2t))$.\n\n## Step 12: Write the complete solution",

    "question": "## Step 1: Understand the task and the domain\nThe task is to generate a challenging but solvable mathematics problem in the domain of integral equations, along with a complete and verifiable solution. The problem should be well-posed, clear, non-trivial, and solvable with established mathematical methods.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the specific domain within integral equations\nIntegral equations involve equations where the unknown function appears under an integral sign. A common type is the Fredholm integral equation of the second kind, given by $f(x) = g(x) + \\lambda \\int_{a}^{b} K(x, t)f(t)dt$, where $f(x)$ is the unknown function, $g(x)$ and $K(x, t)$ are known functions, and $\\lambda$ is a parameter.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a challenging problem\nTo create a challenging problem, we can consider a specific case of the Fredholm integral equation of the second kind with a given kernel $K(x, t)$ and a function $g(x)$, and ask to solve for $f(x)$.\n\n## Step 4: Specify the problem\nLet's consider the integral equation $f(x) = x + \\int_{0}^{1} (xt + x + t)f(t)dt$. This is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. We need to find $f(x)$.\n\n## Step 5: Provide the solution\nTo solve $f(x) = x + \\int_{0}^{1} (xt + x + t)f(t)dt$, let's first simplify the integral.\n$f(x) = x + x\\int_{0}^{1} tf(t)dt + x\\int_{0}^{1} f(t)dt + \\int_{0}^{1} tf(t)dt$.\nLet $A = \\int_{0}^{1} f(t)dt$ and $B = \\int_{0}^{1} tf(t)dt$. Then, $f(x) = x + xB + xA + B = x(1 + A + B) + B$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate A and B using the definitions\nSubstitute $f(x)$ from Step 5 into the definitions of $A$ and $B$.\n$A = \\int_{0}^{1} [t(1 + A + B) + B]dt = \\left[\\frac{t^2}{2}(1 + A + B) + Bt\\right]_{0}^{1} = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + A + B) + B$.\n$B = \\int_{0}^{1} t[t(1 + A + B) + B]dt = \\left[\\frac{t^3}{3}(1 + A + B) + \\frac{Bt^2}{2}\\right]_{0}^{1} = \\frac{1}{3}(1 + A + B) + \\frac{B}{2}$.\n\n## Step 7: Solve for A and B\nFrom Step 6, we have:\n1. $A = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + A + B) + B$\n2. $B = \\frac{1}{3}(1 + A + B) + \\frac{B}{2}$.\n\nSimplifying these equations:\n1. $A = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{A}{2} + \\frac{B}{2} + B$ implies $\\frac{A}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{3B}{2}$, so $A = 1 + 3B$.\n2. $B = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{A}{3} + \\frac{B}{3} + \\frac{B}{2}$ implies $B - \\frac{B}{2} - \\frac{B}{3} = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{A}{3}$, so $\\frac{B}{6} = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{A}{3}$.\n\n## Step 8: Continue solving for A and B\nFrom equation 2 in Step 7: $\\frac{B}{6} = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{A}{3}$, we get $B = 2 + 2A$.\nSubstitute $A = 1 + 3B$ from Step 7 into $B = 2 + 2A$:\n$B = 2 + 2(1 + 3B)$, so $B = 2 + 2 + 6B$, which simplifies to $B = 4 + 6B$, hence $-5B = 4$, and $B = -\\frac{4}{5}$.\n\n## Step 9: Find A using B\nSubstitute $B = -\\frac{4}{5}$ into $A = 1 + 3B$:\n$A = 1 + 3(-\\frac{4}{5}) = 1 - \\frac{12}{5} = -\\frac{7}{5}$.\n\n## Step 10: Substitute A and B back into f(x)\n$f(x) = x(1 + A + B) + B = x(1 - \\frac{7}{5} - \\frac{4}{5}) - \\frac{4}{5}$.\n$f(x) = x(1 - \\frac{11}{5}) - \\frac{4}{5} = x(-\\frac{6}{5}) - \\frac{4}{5}$.\n$f(x) = -\\frac{6}{5}x - \\frac{4}{5}$.\n\nThe final answer is: \n\nSolve the integral equation $f(x) = x + \\int_{0}^{1} (xt + x + t)f(t)dt$ for $f(x)$.",

Find the length of $AD$.\"\n\n## Step 5: Verify the problem meets the criteria\n- **Well-Posedness and Completeness**: The triangle $ABC$ is well-defined by its side lengths (5, 6, 7), and $D$ is defined as the point on $BC$ where $AD$ bisects $\\angle BAC$. The circumcircle and its center $O$ are also well-defined.\n- **Clarity**: The problem statement is clear and unambiguous.\n- **Non-Triviality**: The problem requires applying geometric principles, such as the Angle Bisector Theorem and possibly properties of the circumcircle.\n- **Solvability and Verification**: The problem is solvable using established geometric methods.\n\n## Step 6: Solve the problem\nTo solve this, we can use the Angle Bisector Theorem to find $BD$ and $DC$, and then apply the Stewart's Theorem to find $AD$.\n\n### Step 6.1: Apply the Angle Bisector Theorem\nThe Angle Bisector Theorem states that $\\frac{BD}{DC} = \\frac{AB}{AC}$. So, $\\frac{BD}{DC} = \\frac{5}{6}$.\n\n### Step 6.2: Calculate $BD$ and $DC$\nGiven $BC = 7$, we have $BD + DC = 7$. From the Angle Bisector Theorem, we can write $BD = \\frac{5}{11} \\times 7$ and $DC = \\frac{6}{11} \\times 7$. Thus, $BD = \\frac{35}{11}$ and $DC = \\frac{42}{11}$.\n\n### Step 6.3: Apply Stewart's Theorem to find $AD$\nStewart's Theorem states that $b^2n + c^2m = a(d^2 + m*n)$, where $a = BC = 7$, $b = AC = 6$, $c = AB = 5$, $d = AD$, $m = BD = \\frac{35}{11}$, and $n = DC = \\frac{42}{11}$. Substituting these values gives us an equation to solve for $d = AD$.\n\n## Step 7: Perform Stewart's Theorem calculation\nLet's substitute the given values into Stewart's Theorem:\n$6^2(\\frac{35}{11}) + 5^2(\\frac{42}{11}) = 7(AD^2 + \\frac{35}{11}*\\frac{42}{11})$.\nSimplifying yields:\n$36(\\frac{35}{11}) + 25(\\frac{42}{11}) = 7(AD^2 + \\frac{1470}{121})$.\nThis simplifies to:\n$\\frac{1260}{11} + \\frac{1050}{11} = 7AD^2 + \\frac{7*1470}{121}$.\nFurther simplification gives:\n$\\frac{2310}{11} = 7AD^2 + \\frac{10290}{121}$.\nConverting to a common denominator:\n$\\frac{2310*11}{121} = 7AD^2 + \\frac{10290}{121}$,\n$\\frac{25410}{121} = 7AD^2 + \\frac{10290}{121}$.\nSimplifying:\n$7AD^2 = \\frac{25410 - 10290}{121}$,\n$7AD^2 = \\frac{15120}{121}$,\n$AD^2 = \\frac{15120}{7*121}$,\n$AD^2 = \\frac{2160}{121}$,\n$AD = \\sqrt{\\frac{2160}{121}}$.\n\n## Step 8: Simplify $AD$\n$AD = \\sqrt{\\frac{2160}{121}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{16*135}{121}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{16*9*15}{121}} = \\frac{4*3}{11}\\sqrt{15} = \\frac{12\\sqrt{15}}{11}$.\n\nThe final answer is: \n\nLet $ABC$ be a triangle with $AB = 5$, $AC = 6$, and $BC = 7$. The circumcircle of triangle $ABC$ has center $O$. Let $D$ be the point on $BC$ such that $AD$ is the angle bisector of $\\angle BAC$. Find the length of $AD$.",

The problem should be well-posed, clear, non-trivial, and solvable with established mathematical methods.\n\n## Step 2: Identify a suitable topic within differential geometry\nDifferential geometry is a broad field that includes the study of curves and surfaces, Riemannian geometry, and more. A suitable topic could involve the properties of curves or surfaces, such as curvature, geodesics, or the application of differential geometry to other areas like physics.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a specific problem\nLet's consider a problem involving the curvature of a surface. A classic result in differential geometry is the Theorema Egregium of Gauss, which states that the Gaussian curvature of a surface is invariant under isometric deformations. A challenging problem could involve calculating or utilizing this curvature.\n\n## Step 4: Construct the problem statement\nTo create a problem, let's consider a specific surface and ask a question about its geometric properties. For example, we could examine the surface given by $z = x^2 + y^2$ and ask to compute its Gaussian curvature at a given point.\n\n## Step 5: Write the problem statement\nLet's define the problem: \"Let $S$ be the surface given by $z = x^2 + y^2$. Compute the Gaussian curvature $K$ of $S$ at the point $(1,1,2)$.\"\n\n## Step 6: Provide the solution\nTo solve this, we first need to parameterize the surface. The surface $S$ can be parameterized by $\\vec{r}(x,y) = (x, y, x^2 + y^2)$. The Gaussian curvature $K$ can be found using the formula $K = \\frac{LN - M^2}{EG - F^2}$, where $E, F, G$ are coefficients of the first fundamental form, and $L, M, N$ are coefficients of the second fundamental form.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the first and second fundamental forms\nFirst, compute $\\vec{r}_x = (1, 0, 2x)$ and $\\vec{r}_y = (0, 1, 2y)$. Then, $E = \\vec{r}_x \\cdot \\vec{r}_x = 1 + 4x^2$, $F = \\vec{r}_x \\cdot \\vec{r}_y = 4xy$, and $G = \\vec{r}_y \\cdot \\vec{r}_y = 1 + 4y^2$. The normal vector $\\vec{n} = \\frac{\\vec{r}_x \\times \\vec{r}_y}{\\|\\vec{r}_x \\times \\vec{r}_y\\|}$, and $\\vec{r}_x \\times \\vec{r}_y = (-2x, -2y, 1)$, so $\\|\\vec{r}_x \\times \\vec{r}_y\\| = \\sqrt{4x^2 + 4y^2 + 1}$. Thus, $\\vec{n} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4x^2 + 4y^2 + 1}}(-2x, -2y, 1)$.\n\n## Step 8: Continue with the calculation of $L, M, N$\n$L = \\vec{r}_{xx} \\cdot \\vec{n}$, $M = \\vec{r}_{xy} \\cdot \\vec{n}$, and $N = \\vec{r}_{yy} \\cdot \\vec{n}$. We have $\\vec{r}_{xx} = (0, 0, 2)$, $\\vec{r}_{xy} = (0, 0, 0)$, and $\\vec{r}_{yy} = (0, 0, 2)$. So, $L = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{4x^2 + 4y^2 + 1}}$, $M = 0$, and $N = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{4x^2 + 4y^2 + 1}}$.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate $K$ at $(1,1,2)$\nAt $(1,1,2)$, $x = 1$, $y = 1$, so $E = 5$, $F = 4$, $G = 5$, $L = \\frac{2}{3}$, $M = 0$, and $N = \\frac{2}{3}$. Thus, $EG - F^2 = 25 - 16 = 9$ and $LN - M^2 = \\frac{4}{9}$.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate $K$\n$K = \\frac{LN - M^2}{EG - F^2} = \\frac{\\frac{4}{9}}{9} = \\frac{4}{81}$.\n\nThe final answer is: \n\nLet $S$ be the surface given by $z = x^2 + y^2$.

    "question": "## Step 1: Understand the task and the domain\nThe task is to generate a challenging but solvable mathematics problem in the domain of \"Global analysis, analysis on manifolds\" along with a complete and verifiable solution. The problem should be well-posed, clear, non-trivial, and solvable with established mathematical methods.\n\n## Step 2: Identify key concepts in the domain\nGlobal analysis and analysis on manifolds involve the study of geometric and topological properties of manifolds using analytical techniques. Key concepts include differential forms, integration on manifolds, Stokes' theorem, and the study of differential equations on manifolds.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a problem\nTo create a problem, we need to identify a specific concept or technique within global analysis or analysis on manifolds that can be used to formulate a challenging yet solvable question. One such concept is the application of Stokes' theorem, which relates the integral of a differential form over a manifold to the integral of its exterior derivative over the boundary of the manifold.\n\n## Step 4: Construct the problem\nLet's consider a specific manifold and a differential form. A common example is the unit sphere $S^2$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. We can formulate a problem involving the integration of a differential form over $S^2$ and applying Stokes' theorem.\n\n## Step 5: Specify the problem\nLet $\\omega = y \\, dx \\wedge dz$ be a 2-form on $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Consider the unit sphere $S^2 = \\{ (x, y, z) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 : x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1 \\}$ oriented with the outward unit normal. Evaluate $\\int_{S^2} \\omega$.\n\n## Step 6: Provide the solution\nTo solve this, we can directly integrate $\\omega$ over $S^2$ or apply Stokes' theorem. Stokes' theorem states that $\\int_M d\\omega = \\int_{\\partial M} \\omega$, where $M$ is a manifold with boundary $\\partial M$. Here, we can consider $M = B^3 = \\{ (x, y, z) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 : x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\leq 1 \\}$, so $\\partial M = S^2$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate $d\\omega$\n$d\\omega = d(y \\, dx \\wedge dz) = dy \\wedge dx \\wedge dz = -dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz$ because $d(y) = dy$, $d(dx) = 0$, and $d(dz) = 0$. So, $d\\omega = -dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz$.\n\n## Step 8: Apply Stokes' theorem\n$\\int_{S^2} \\omega = \\int_{B^3} d\\omega = \\int_{B^3} -dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz = -\\int_{B^3} dV$, where $dV = dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz$ is the volume form on $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Thus, $\\int_{S^2} \\omega = -\\text{Vol}(B^3)$.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the volume of $B^3$\nThe volume of the unit ball $B^3$ is given by $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(1)^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi$.\n\n## Step 10: Conclude the solution\n$\\int_{S^2} \\omega = -\\frac{4}{3}\\pi$.\n\nThe final answer is: \n\nLet $\\omega = y \\, dx \\wedge dz$ be a 2-form on $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Consider the unit sphere $S^2 = \\{ (x, y, z) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 : x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1 \\}$ oriented with the outward unit normal. Evaluate $\\int_{S^2} \\omega$.",
