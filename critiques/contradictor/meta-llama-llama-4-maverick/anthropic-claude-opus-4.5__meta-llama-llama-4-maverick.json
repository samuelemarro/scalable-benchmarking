    "question": "Let's consider a combinatorial problem involving a specific type of lattice path. We are given a grid where we can move either right (R) or up (U). The task is to count the number of paths from the origin (0,0) to the point (n,n) that stay within the region bounded by the lines $y = x - k$ and $y = x + k$ for a given $k$, where $n$ and $k$ are positive integers and $n \\geq k$. The paths must consist of $n$ steps to the right and $n$ steps up, and they must not cross the given boundaries.\n\n## Step 1: Understand the constraints\nThe problem asks us to count the number of lattice paths from (0,0) to (n,n) that stay within the boundaries defined by $y = x - k$ and $y = x + k$. This means that at any point (x, y) on the path, the condition $x - k \\leq y \\leq x + k$ must be satisfied.\n\n## Step 2: Recognize the problem as a combinatorial paths problem with restrictions\nThe total number of paths from (0,0) to (n,n) without any restrictions is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{2n}{n}$, as each path consists of $n$ right moves and $n$ up moves.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the reflection principle for the boundaries\nTo count paths that stay within the given boundaries, we can use the reflection principle. This principle states that the number of paths that cross a certain boundary can be counted by reflecting the paths at the boundary and counting the paths from the reflected starting point to the original endpoint.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of paths that violate the boundaries\nFor a path to be valid, it must not cross $y = x + k$ or $y = x - k$. Let's first consider the boundary $y = x + k$. A path crosses this boundary if it reaches a point $(x, x+k+1)$ for some $x$. Using the reflection principle, we reflect such paths at $y = x + k$ to count them. The number of paths from (0,0) to (n,n) that cross $y = x + k$ can be related to paths from $(-k-1, k+1)$ to $(n,n)$, which is $\\binom{2n}{n-k-1}$.\n\n## Step 5: Similarly, calculate the number of paths that cross the lower boundary $y = x - k$\nFor the boundary $y = x - k$, a path crosses it if it reaches $(x, x-k-1)$. Reflecting at $y = x - k$, we count paths from $(k+1, -k-1)$ to $(n,n)$, giving $\\binom{2n}{n-k-1}$ paths.\n\n## Step 6: Consider paths that cross both boundaries\nPaths that cross both $y = x + k$ and $y = x - k$ need to be considered to avoid double-counting when applying the principle of inclusion-exclusion. A path that crosses both boundaries can be reflected twice. For instance, reflecting first at $y = x + k$ and then at $y = x - k$ (or vice versa), we can count such paths. The first reflection takes a path from (0,0) to a point that crosses $y = x + k$, say to $(x, x+k+1)$, and reflects it to $(-k-1, k+1)$. A subsequent crossing of $y = x - k$ and reflection would relate to paths from $(-k-1 + (k+1), k+1 - (k+1) -1)$ = $(0, -1)$ to $(n,n)$ after the first reflection, but we actually need to consider the effective reflection for paths crossing both boundaries. For a path crossing both, after the first reflection (say at $y = x + k$), it goes from $(-k-1, k+1)$ to a point where it crosses $y = x - k$, which after reflection gives a path from $(-k-1 + (2k+1), k+1 - (2k+1)) = (k, -k)$ to $(n,n)$, resulting in $\\binom{2n}{n-k}$.\n\n## Step 7: Apply the principle of inclusion-exclusion\nThe total number of paths that stay within the boundaries is the total number of paths minus the paths that cross the upper boundary minus the paths that cross the lower boundary, plus the paths that cross both (to correct for double subtraction). So, the formula becomes: $\\binom{2n}{n} - 2\\binom{2n}{n-k-1} + \\binom{2n}{n-k}$.\n\nThe final answer is:",

    "question": "Let $p$ be a prime number greater than $3$. Prove that the sum of the reciprocals of the quadratic residues modulo $p$ that are less than $p$ is congruent to $0$ modulo $p$ if $p \\equiv 1 \\mod 4$, and is congruent to a non-zero value modulo $p$ if $p \\equiv 3 \\mod 4$. Specifically, for $p \\equiv 3 \\mod 4$, find the non-zero value modulo $p$ that the sum is congruent to.\n\n## Step 1: Understand the problem statement\nThe problem asks us to prove a statement about the sum of the reciprocals of the quadratic residues modulo a prime $p > 3$. We need to show that this sum is congruent to $0$ modulo $p$ if $p \\equiv 1 \\mod 4$ and to a non-zero value modulo $p$ if $p \\equiv 3 \\mod 4$, and specifically identify this non-zero value for $p \\equiv 3 \\mod 4$.\n\n## Step 2: Identify quadratic residues modulo $p$\nQuadratic residues modulo $p$ are numbers $a$ such that $a \\equiv x^2 \\mod p$ for some $x$. For a prime $p$, there are $\\frac{p-1}{2}$ quadratic residues and $\\frac{p-1}{2}$ non-residues modulo $p$.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the sum of reciprocals of quadratic residues\nLet's denote the sum of the reciprocals of the quadratic residues modulo $p$ as $S = \\sum_{a \\in QR} \\frac{1}{a}$, where $QR$ denotes the set of quadratic residues less than $p$. We need to evaluate $S \\mod p$.\n\n## Step 4: Use properties of quadratic residues to simplify $S$\nFor $p \\equiv 1 \\mod 4$, $-1$ is a quadratic residue. This implies that for every $a$ that is a quadratic residue, $-a$ is also a quadratic residue, and their reciprocals sum to $\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{-a} = \\frac{1}{a} - \\frac{1}{a} = 0 \\mod p$ if we were considering their sum directly. However, we need to directly examine the sum $S$.\n\n## Step 5: Examine $S$ using the definition of quadratic residues\nSince $a$ is a quadratic residue if and only if $a \\equiv x^2 \\mod p$ for some $x$, we can rewrite $S$ as $S = \\sum_{x=1}^{p-1} \\frac{1}{x^2} \\mod p$, but we must be cautious about double counting and the fact that $x=0$ is not included.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the expression for $S$ further\nNotice that $\\sum_{x=1}^{p-1} x^2 = \\frac{(p-1)p(2p-1)}{6}$, and we are interested in the sum of $\\frac{1}{x^2}$. However, directly using this is not straightforward. Instead, consider that for every $x$, there exists a unique $x'$ such that $xx' \\equiv 1 \\mod p$, and thus $\\frac{1}{x^2} \\equiv (x')^2 \\mod p$. The sum of $\\frac{1}{x^2}$ over all $x$ from $1$ to $p-1$ can be related to the sum of $x^2$ over the same range due to the properties of modular inverses.\n\n## Step 7: Evaluate the condition for $p \\equiv 1 \\mod 4$ and $p \\equiv 3 \\mod 4$\nFor $p \\equiv 1 \\mod 4$, the sum $S$ can be shown to be $0 \\mod p$ by considering the pairing of residues and their negatives, but a more direct approach involves understanding that the set of quadratic residues is invariant under multiplication by a quadratic residue. For $p \\equiv 3 \\mod 4$, $-1$ is not a quadratic residue, and the analysis involves understanding the properties of the Legendre symbol and the distribution of quadratic residues.\n\n## Step 8: Directly compute $S$ for $p \\equiv 3 \\mod 4$\nTo find the non-zero value modulo $p$ that $S$ is congruent to when $p \\equiv 3 \\mod 4$, consider that $S = \\sum_{a \\in QR} \\frac{1}{a}$. By using the fact that the product of all non-zero residues modulo $p$ is $(p-1)!$, and relating the sum of reciprocals of quadratic residues to the properties of $p$, we can derive the congruence.\n\n## Step 9: Simplify using Euler's criterion and properties of quadratic residues\nFor $p \\equiv 3 \\mod 4$, we know that $\\left(\\frac{-1}{p}\\right) = -1$. The sum of the reciprocals of the quadratic residues can be related to the sum of all reciprocals and the properties of the Legendre symbol.\n\n## Step 10: Derive the specific non-zero congruence for $p \\equiv 3 \\mod 4$\nUsing the fact that $\\sum_{x=1}^{p-1} \\frac{1}{x} \\equiv 0 \\mod p$ because the terms can be paired as $x$ and $p-x$, and considering the distribution of quadratic residues, we can derive that $S \\equiv 0 \\mod p$ for $p \\equiv 1 \\mod 4$. For $p \\equiv 3 \\mod 4$, leveraging the fact that the quadratic residues are related to the Legendre symbol, we find that the sum is related to $0$ but needs a specific derivation.\n\nThe final step to directly solve for $S$ when $p \\equiv 3 \\mod 4$ involves complex number theory principles. Specifically, it is known that for $p \\equiv 3 \\mod 4$, the sum of the reciprocals of the quadratic residues modulo $p$ is congruent to $0$ if we consider the sum over all residues and apply appropriate modular arithmetic principles.",
