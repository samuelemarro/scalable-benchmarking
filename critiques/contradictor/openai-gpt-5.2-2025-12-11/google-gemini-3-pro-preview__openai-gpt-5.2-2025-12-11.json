    "question": "Assume the **Compactness Theorem for first-order logic**: if a set $T$ of first-order sentences has the property that every finite subset of $T$ has a model, then $T$ has a model.\n\nProve that there exists a **nonprincipal ultrafilter** $\\mathcal U$ on $\\omega=\\{0,1,2,\\dots\\}$. Concretely, show that there is a family $\\mathcal U\\subseteq\\mathcal P(\\omega)$ such that:\n\n1. (Filter) $\\omega\\in\\mathcal U$; if $A\\in\\mathcal U$ and $A\\subseteq B\\subseteq\\omega$ then $B\\in\\mathcal U$; and if $A,B\\in\\mathcal U$ then $A\\cap B\\in\\mathcal U$.\n2. (Ultra) For every $A\\subseteq\\omega$, exactly one of $A$ or $\\omega\\setminus A$ lies in $\\mathcal U$.\n3. (Nonprincipal) For every $n\\in\\omega$, $\\{n\\}\\notin\\mathcal U$.\n\nYou must construct $\\mathcal U$ from a model whose existence is obtained by compactness, and then verify (1)\u2013(3).\n\n---",
