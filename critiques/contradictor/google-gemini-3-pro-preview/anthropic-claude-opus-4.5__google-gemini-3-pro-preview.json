This problem requires synthesizing knowledge of splitting fields, degree calculations, group structure identification, and the Galois correspondence to perform a counting task. It is non-trivial, well-posed, and has a verifiable integer solution.\n\n\nLet $f(x) = x^5 - 2 \\in \\mathbb{Q}[x]$. Let $K \\subseteq \\mathbb{C}$ be the splitting field of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n1. Determine the degree of the field extension $[K : \\mathbb{Q}]$.\n2. Identify the Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ up to isomorphism.\n3. Using the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, calculate the number of strict intermediate fields of the extension. That is, determine the number of fields $F$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq F \\subsetneq K$.",

The Laplace transform approach is correctly applied: the convolution structure is properly identified, and $\\mathcal{L}\\{t^{-1/2}\\} = \\sqrt{\\pi/s}$ is correct. The partial fraction decomposition with substitution $u = \\sqrt{s}$ is verified: setting $u=-1$ gives $A=-1/2$, and coefficient matching correctly yields $B=C=1/2$. All inverse Laplace transforms are accurate: (1) $\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{1/(\\sqrt{s}+1)\\} = 1/\\sqrt{\\pi t} - e^t\\operatorname{erfc}(\\sqrt{t})$ follows from the standard transform pair involving $\\mathcal{L}\\{e^{a^2t}\\operatorname{erfc}(a\\sqrt{t})\\}$; (2) $\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{1/(\\sqrt{s}(s+1))\\} = e^{-t}\\operatorname{erfi}(\\sqrt{t})$ is verified via convolution (substituting $u=\\sqrt{\\tau}$ gives the integral $\\frac{2e^{-t}}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\int_0^{\\sqrt{t}} e^{u^2}du = e^{-t}\\operatorname{erfi}(\\sqrt{t})$). The cancellation of $1/\\sqrt{\\pi t}$ terms is correct, and the final simplification to $y(t) = \\frac{1}{2}[e^t\\operatorname{erfc}(\\sqrt{t}) + e^{-t}(1-\\operatorname{erfi}(\\sqrt{t}))]$ follows correctly. The solution also passes a consistency check at $t=0$: $y(0) = \\frac{1}{2}[1\\cdot 1 + 1\\cdot(1-0)] = 1 = e^0$, matching the original equation.",
