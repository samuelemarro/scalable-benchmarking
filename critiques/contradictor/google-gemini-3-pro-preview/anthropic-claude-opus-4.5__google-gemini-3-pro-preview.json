The boundary term vanishes since $\\sin(n\\pi) = 0$.\n\n4. **Summation:** Only odd $n$ contribute, yielding $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{J_n}{n} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(2k+1)^3} = -\\frac{7}{16}\\zeta(3)$. The identity $\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(2k+1)^3} = \\frac{7}{8}\\zeta(3)$ is correctly derived.\n\n5. **Final assembly:** $A = -\\frac{\\pi^2}{8}\\ln 2 + \\frac{7}{16}\\zeta(3)$ combines correctly to give $I = 2A + \\frac{\\pi^2}{4}\\ln 2 = \\frac{7}{8}\\zeta(3)$ after the logarithmic terms cancel.\n\nThe interchange of summation and integration is justified by the uniform convergence of the Fourier series on compact subsets and the integrability of the integrand.",

However, the problem explicitly asks to 'Prove that $T_F$ is a trace class operator,' and the answer only states 'Integral operators with Schwartz kernels on $\\mathbb{R}$ are known to be trace class' without justification. This assertion, while true in this context, is not a proof\u2014it's an appeal to an unstated theorem. A rigorous verification would need to show, for example, that the kernel admits a decomposition $K(t,u) = \\sum_n \\lambda_n f_n(t) g_n(u)$ with $\\sum|\\lambda_n| < \\infty$, or use the factorization structure of the kernel to establish the trace class property.",
        "suggestions": "To complete the proof, show that the kernel factors appropriately or use the Hermite function expansion. For instance, note that $K(t,u) = f(t) \\cdot g(u-t)$ where $f \\in L^2(\\mathbb{R})$ and $g \\in L^1(\\mathbb{R}) \\cap L^2(\\mathbb{R})$, and argue that the composition $M_f \\circ C_g$ (multiplication by $f$ composed with convolution by $g$) is trace class via the ideal property, or expand the kernel using the Mehler formula for Gaussian kernels in terms of Hermite functions to explicitly verify the trace class condition.",

The identified gap\u2014that the trace class property is asserted rather than proven\u2014is a legitimate concern since the problem explicitly asks to 'Prove that $T_F$ is a trace class operator.' The verdict of 'insufficient' is appropriate: the computation is correct with no errors, but the proof is incomplete because the trace class claim relies on an unstated theorem without verification of hypotheses.

(4) Substituting into the eigenvector condition yields $\\lambda^2 + 2\\lambda - 1 = 0$ with roots $\\lambda = -1 \\pm \\sqrt{2}$. (5) The decay condition $|\\mu| < 1$ is correctly verified: for $\\lambda = -1 - \\sqrt{2}$, $\\mu = \\sqrt{2} - 1 < 1$ (decaying), while for $\\lambda = -1 + \\sqrt{2}$, $|\\mu| = 1 + \\sqrt{2} > 1$ (growing). The self-adjointness of $T$ (verifiable from the symmetric matrix representation) justifies restricting to real eigenvalues.
