    "question": "The following problem addresses the intersection of Model Theory and Computability Theory, specifically concerning the properties of models of Peano Arithmetic.\n\n\n**Problem Statement**\n\nLet $\\mathcal{L} = \\{+, \\times, <, 0, 1\\}$ be the language of arithmetic. Let $PA$ denote the first-order theory of Peano Arithmetic.\n\nA structure $\\mathcal{M} = (D, +^\\mathcal{M}, \\times^\\mathcal{M}, <^\\mathcal{M}, 0^\\mathcal{M}, 1^\\mathcal{M})$ is defined to be a **computable model** if:\n1. The domain $D$ is the set of natural numbers $\\mathbb{N}$.\n2. The operations $+^\\mathcal{M}: \\mathbb{N} \\times \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}$ and $\\times^\\mathcal{M}: \\mathbb{N} \\times \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}$ are computable (recursive) functions.\n3. The relation $<^\\mathcal{M} \\subseteq \\mathbb{N} \\times \\mathbb{N}$ is a computable (recursive) relation.\n\nProve that there are no computable non-standard models of $PA$. In other words, show that if $\\mathcal{M}$ is a computable model of $PA$, then $\\mathcal{M}$ is isomorphic to the standard model $\\mathcal{N} = (\\mathbb{N}, +, \\times, <, 0, 1)$.\n\n*Note: You may assume standard results from computability theory, such as the existence of recursively enumerable sets that are recursively inseparable, provided they are clearly stated.*",
