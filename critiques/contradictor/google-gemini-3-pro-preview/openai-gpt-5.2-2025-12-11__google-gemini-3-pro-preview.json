          "improvements": "Optionally, tighten one minor point in the critique: under the common splitting $A=D-L-U$, the Jacobi matrix is $B_J=D^{-1}(L+U)$ (not $-D^{-1}(L+U)$), though the critique already notes this is a sign-convention issue and the spectral radius is unaffected. You could also explicitly note why Young\u2019s SOR optimal-parameter formula applies here (e.g., $A$ is SPD for $|\\alpha|<\\sec(\\pi/(n+1))$ and the ordering is consistent for a tridiagonal matrix), but this does not affect the correctness of the critique."
