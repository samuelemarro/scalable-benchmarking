Correct approach (for primes p>3): write p^2-1=(p-1)(p+1). Since p is odd, p-1 and p+1 are two consecutive even integers: one is divisible by 4 and the other by 2, so their product is divisible by 8. Also any prime p>3 satisfies p\u2261\u00b11 (mod 3), so p^2\u22611 (mod 3) and hence p^2-1 is divisible by 3. Combining these, p^2-1 is divisible by lcm(8,3)=24.
