    "question": "Consider the algebraic curve $C$ defined by the equation $y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$ over the complex numbers $\\mathbb{C}$, where $a, b \\in \\mathbb{C}$ and the discriminant $\\Delta = -16(4a^3 + 27b^2) \\neq 0$. This ensures that $C$ is a nonsingular elliptic curve. Let $P = (x_1, y_1)$ be a point on $C$ such that $y_1 \\neq 0$.\n\n1. Define the group law on $C$ and describe the addition of two points $P$ and $Q$ on $C$.\n2. Given a point $P = (x_1, y_1)$ on $C$, find the coordinates of $-P$.\n3. Prove that the set of points on $C$ forms an abelian group under this addition law, with the point at infinity $\\mathcal{O}$ as the identity element.",
