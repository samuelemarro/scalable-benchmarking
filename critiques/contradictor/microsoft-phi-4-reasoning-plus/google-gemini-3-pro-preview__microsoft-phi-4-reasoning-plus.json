You are tasked with approximating the integral $I = \\int_{0}^{1} f(x) \\, dx$ using numerical methods. \n\n1. Use the trapezoidal rule with $n = 4$ subintervals to approximate $I$. Provide the approximation and the error bound for this method.\n\n2. Use Simpson's rule with $n = 4$ subintervals to approximate $I$. Provide the approximation and the error bound for this method.\n\n3. Compare the results from the trapezoidal rule and Simpson's rule. Discuss which method provides a better approximation and why, based on the error bounds.\n\n**Note:** The error bound for the trapezoidal rule is given by $E_T = -\\frac{(b-a)^3}{12n^2} f''(\\xi)$ for some $\\xi \\in [a, b]$, and for Simpson's rule, it is $E_S = -\\frac{(b-a)^5}{180n^4} f^{(4)}(\\eta)$ for some $\\eta \\in [a, b]$.",
