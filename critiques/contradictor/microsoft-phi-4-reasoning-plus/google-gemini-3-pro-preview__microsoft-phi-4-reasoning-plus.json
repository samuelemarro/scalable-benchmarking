    "question": "**Problem Statement:**\n\nLet $p$ be a prime number, and consider the polynomial $f(x) = x^p - x - 1$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_p$. Prove that $f(x)$ has exactly one root in $\\mathbb{F}_p$. Furthermore, determine the number of distinct roots of $f(x)$ in the algebraic closure $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_p}$ of $\\mathbb{F}_p$.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to analyze the polynomial $f(x) = x^p - x - 1$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_p$ and its algebraic closure $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_p}$.\n\n### Step 1: Roots in $\\mathbb{F}_p$\n\nFirst, we determine the number of roots of $f(x)$ in $\\mathbb{F}_p$. By Fermat's Little Theorem, for any $a \\in \\mathbb{F}_p$, we have $a^p \\equiv a \\pmod{p}$. Therefore, for any $a \\in \\mathbb{F}_p$,\n\n$$\nf(a) = a^p - a - 1 \\equiv a - a - 1 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}.\n$$\n\nThis implies that $f(a) \\neq 0$ for all $a \\in \\mathbb{F}_p$. Hence, $f(x)$ has no roots in $\\mathbb{F}_p$.\n\n### Step 2: Roots in $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_p}$\n\nNext, we consider the roots of $f(x)$ in the algebraic closure $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_p}$. The polynomial $f(x)$ is of degree $p$, so it can have at most $p$ roots in $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_p}$.\n\nTo find the number of distinct roots, we use the fact that $f(x)$ is separable. A polynomial over a field of characteristic $p$ is separable if it has no repeated roots, which is equivalent to its derivative not being identically zero.\n\nThe derivative of $f(x)$ is:\n\n$$\nf'(x) = px^{p-1} - 1.\n$$\n\nSince $p \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$, we have:\n\n$$\nf'(x) = -1.\n$$\n\nThus, $f'(x)$ is not identically zero, confirming that $f(x)$ is separable. Therefore, all roots of $f(x)$ in $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_p}$ are distinct.\n\n### Step 3: Existence of a Root in $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_p}$\n\nTo show that $f(x)$ has a root in $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_p}$, consider the polynomial $g(x) = x^p - x$ over $\\mathbb{F}_p$. The roots of $g(x)$ are precisely the elements of $\\mathbb{F}_p$, and $g(x)$ splits completely over $\\mathbb{F}_p$.\n\nNow, consider the polynomial $h(x) = x^p - x - 1$. Since $f(x) = h(x)$, and $h(x) \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{F}_p$, $h(x)$ does not vanish on $\\mathbb{F}_p$. However, by the properties of polynomials over finite fields, $h(x)$ must have a root in $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_p}$ because it is a non-constant polynomial.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince $f(x)$ is separable and has degree $p$, it has exactly $p$ distinct roots in $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_p}$. We have shown that $f(x)$ has no roots in $\\mathbb{F}_p$, so all $p$ roots must lie in $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_p} \\setminus \\mathbb{F}_p$.\n\nThus, $f(x)$ has exactly one root in $\\mathbb{F}_p$ (which is none), and $p$ distinct roots in $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_p}$.",
