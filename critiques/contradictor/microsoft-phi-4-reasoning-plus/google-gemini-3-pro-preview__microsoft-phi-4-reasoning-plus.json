        "notes": "The answer contains calculation errors that lead to an incorrect result. Specifically, in Step 2, the characteristic polynomial is correctly determined to be $-\\lambda^3 - 7\\lambda^2 - 12\\lambda$, but the roots are incorrectly identified as $0, -1, -4$. The correct roots (eigenvalues) are $0, -3, -4$ since $\\lambda^2 + 7\\lambda + 12 = (\\lambda+3)(\\lambda+4)$. Consequently, the computed matrix exponential $e^Q$ is incorrect; notably, the resulting matrix is not stochastic (the rows do not sum to 1), which is a necessary property of a transition matrix. For example, the first row sums to $5/6 + 1/3 + 1/6 = 8/6 \\neq 1$.",
        "suggestions": "Recalculate the eigenvalues of $Q$ using the correct factorization of the characteristic polynomial. Then, recompute the matrix exponential $e^{Qt}$ (or specifically the required entry) using the correct eigenvalues ($0, -3, -4$) and associated eigenvectors. Ensure the final transition matrix is stochastic.",
