Thus, $f$ must be equal to some $\\varphi_e$ where $e \\in \\mathrm{Tot}$.\n\n## Step 6: Derive a Contradiction\nSince $f$ is total recursive, there exists some $i$ such that $f = \\varphi_{e_i}$.

We have $\\sum_{k=0}^{n} (-1)^{k} \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{2k}{k} x^k = [y^n](1 - (1-4xy)^{-1/2})^n$. Setting $x = \\frac{1}{4}$ gives us the desired summation.\n\n## Step 6: Evaluate the Expression at $x = \\frac{1}{4}$\nSubstituting $x = \\frac{1}{4}$ into the expression, we get $4^n \\sum_{k=0}^{n} (-1)^{k} \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{2k}{k} (\\frac{1}{4})^k = 4^n [y^n](1 - (1-y)^{-1/2})^n$.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the Coefficient Extraction\n$[y^n](1 - (1-y)^{-1/2})^n = [y^n](1 - \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{2k}{k} \\frac{y^k}{2^{2k}})^n$. For $x = \\frac{1}{4}$, this simplifies to extracting the coefficient from $(1 - (1-y)^{-1/2})^n$.\n\n## Step 8: Relate to $\\binom{2n}{n}$\nWe need to show that $4^n [y^n](1 - (1-y)^{-1/2})^n = \\binom{2n}{n}$. This involves understanding that $[y^n](1-y)^{-1/2}$ gives $\\binom{2n}{n} \\frac{1}{2^{2n}}$.\n\n## Step 9: Finalize the Proof\nUsing the binomial theorem, $(1 - (1-y)^{-1/2})^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} (1-y)^{-k/2}$. The coefficient of $y^n$ in this expansion, after simplification and applying the appropriate binomial coefficients, will yield $\\binom{2n}{n}$ when multiplied by $4^n$.\n\n## Step 10: Direct Calculation\nConsider $[x^n] (1 - \\sqrt{1-4x})^n = \\frac{1}{2^n} [x^n] (2 - (1 + \\sqrt{1-4x}))^n = \\frac{1}{2^n} [x^n] (\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} (-1)^k (\\sqrt{1-4x})^k 2^{n-k})$.

        "answer": "## Step 1: Understand the given equation and the task\nThe equation given is $y^3 = x^2 + 2$, and we need to find all integer solutions $(x, y)$ that satisfy this equation. This involves analyzing the equation for possible integer values of $x$ and $y$.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the equation for $y^3 = x^2 + 2$\nTo start solving, we should consider the properties of the given equation. Notice that $y^3$ is a perfect cube and $x^2 + 2$ is $2$ more than a perfect square. We need to examine how these two expressions can be equal for integer values of $x$ and $y$.\n\n## Step 3: Examine the equation modulo 4 to restrict possible values of $x$ and $y$\nLet's analyze the equation modulo 4. For any integer $x$, $x^2 \\mod 4$ can be either $0$ (if $x$ is even) or $1$ (if $x$ is odd). Thus, $x^2 + 2 \\mod 4$ can be either $2$ (if $x$ is even) or $3$ (if $x$ is odd). Now, considering $y^3 \\mod 4$, for any integer $y$, $y^3 \\mod 4$ can be either $0$ (if $y$ is even) or $y \\mod 4$ (if $y$ is odd), because $y^3 \\equiv y \\mod 4$ by Fermat's little theorem for $p=2$ or simple checking. So, $y^3$ can be $0$ or $1$ or $3$ modulo $4$ when $y$ is even or odd respectively, but more precisely, it depends on $y \\mod 4$. If $y$ is even, $y^3$ is $0 \\mod 4$. If $y \\equiv 1 \\mod 4$, $y^3 \\equiv 1 \\mod 4$. If $y \\equiv 3 \\mod 4$, $y^3 \\equiv 3 \\mod 4$. We need $y^3$ to be congruent to $2$ or $3 \\mod 4$ to match $x^2 + 2$. This implies $y$ must be odd since $y^3$ needs to be $3 \\mod 4$, suggesting $y \\equiv 3 \\mod 4$.\n\n## Step 4: Further analysis and checking for small values of $y$\nSince $y$ is odd, let's start by checking small odd values of $y$ to see if there are any corresponding integer values of $x$ that satisfy the equation. For $y = -1$, $y^3 = -1$, and $x^2 = -3$, which has no real solution. For $y = 1$, $y^3 = 1$, and $x^2 = -1$, which also has no real solution. For $y = 3$, $y^3 = 27$, and $x^2 = 25$, so $x = \\pm 5$. Thus, $(x, y) = (5, 3)$ and $(-5, 3)$ are solutions.\n\n## Step 5: Checking for larger values of $y$\nFor larger odd $y$, particularly $y > 3$, we need to check if there are any patterns or limitations. Notice that as $y$ increases, $y^3$ grows faster than $x^2$, but we need to systematically check if there are any other integer solutions.\n\n## Step 6: Analyzing the difference between consecutive cubes and the growth rate of $x^2 + 2$\nTo see if there are more solutions, consider the difference between consecutive cubes: $(y+1)^3 - y^3 = 3y^2 + 3y + 1$. For $y = 3$, this difference is $3(3)^2 + 3(3) + 1 = 27 + 9 + 1 = 37$. The next cube after $27$ is $64$, and $x^2 + 2 = 64$ gives $x^2 = 62$, which does not yield an integer $x$. For larger $y$, the gap between $y^3$ and $(y+1)^3$ increases, making it less likely for $x^2 + 2$ to fall between them or exactly on the next cube.\n\n## Step 7: Checking negative $y$ values\nFor negative $y$, since $y^3$ is negative, $x^2 + 2 < 0$ implies $x^2 < -2$, which is impossible for real $x$. Thus, there are no negative $y$ solutions.\n\n## Step 8: Verifying the solutions found\nWe have found solutions $(5, 3)$ and $(-5, 3)$. Let's verify these satisfy the original equation: For $(5, 3)$, $5^2 + 2 = 25 + 2 = 27 = 3^3$, and for $(-5, 3)$, $(-5)^2 + 2 = 25 + 2 = 27 = 3^3$. Both are valid.\n\n## Step 9: Checking if there are any other solutions for larger $y$\nFor $y > 3$, we need to check if $y^3 - 2$ is a perfect square. Let's examine $y = 5$: $5^3 = 125$, so $x^2 = 123$, which is not a perfect square. As $y$ increases, the likelihood of $y^3 - 2$ being a perfect square diminishes rapidly due to the increasing difference between consecutive squares and the specific values of $y^3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(-5, 3), (5, 3)}$",

To start, we need to understand the properties of $L$, $J(L)$, and $D(J(L))$, and how $\\varphi$ operates.\n\n## Step 2: Verify that $\\varphi(a)$ is indeed an order ideal for any $a \\in L$\nFor $a \\in L$, $\\varphi(a) = \\{ j \\in J(L) \\mid j \\leq a \\}$. To show $\\varphi(a)$ is an order ideal, consider $x \\in \\varphi(a)$ and $y \\in J(L)$ with $y \\leq x$. Since $x \\leq a$ and $y \\leq x$, by transitivity, $y \\leq a$, hence $y \\in \\varphi(a)$. This confirms $\\varphi(a)$ is an order ideal.\n\n## Step 3: Prove that $\\varphi$ preserves the join operation, i.e., $\\varphi(a \\vee b) = \\varphi(a) \\cup \\varphi(b)$\nTo show $\\varphi(a \\vee b) = \\varphi(a) \\cup \\varphi(b)$, first note that $a \\leq a \\vee b$ and $b \\leq a \\vee b$, so $\\varphi(a) \\subseteq \\varphi(a \\vee b)$ and $\\varphi(b) \\subseteq \\varphi(a \\vee b)$, hence $\\varphi(a) \\cup \\varphi(b) \\subseteq \\varphi(a \\vee b)$. For the reverse inclusion, let $j \\in \\varphi(a \\vee b)$, so $j \\leq a \\vee b$. Since $j$ is join-irreducible, $j = j \\wedge (a \\vee b) = (j \\wedge a) \\vee (j \\wedge b)$. Thus, $j = j \\wedge a$ or $j = j \\wedge b$, implying $j \\leq a$ or $j \\leq b$, so $j \\in \\varphi(a)$ or $j \\in \\varphi(b)$, hence $j \\in \\varphi(a) \\cup \\varphi(b)$.

For $a$, let $a = \\bigvee \\{j \\in J(L) \\mid j \\leq a\\} = \\bigvee \\varphi(a)$, and similarly, $b = \\bigvee \\varphi(b)$.

Consider $a = \\bigvee I$. For $j \\in \\varphi(a)$, we have $j \\leq a = \\bigvee I$. Since $j$ is join-irreducible and $L$ is distributive, $j$ must be less than or equal to some element of $I$, but since $I$ is an order ideal, this implies $j \\in I$. Thus, $\\varphi(a) \\subseteq I$. For the reverse inclusion, if $j \\in I$, then $j \\leq \\bigvee I = a$, so $j \\in \\varphi(a)$.

Setting $b = a$, we get $a = aaa = a^3$. This implies $a^2 = a$ because we can simplify $a = aaa$ to $a = a^2 \\cdot a$, and using the property of $S$ being a semigroup (associative), we can derive $a^2 = a$ by considering $a = aba$ and substituting $b = e$ (if $S$ had an identity) or using the given equation directly with appropriate substitution.

However, to directly prove $a^2 = a$, consider the given equation $a = aba$. By setting $b = e$ (if it existed), we wouldn't directly get $a^2 = a$. Instead, we use $a = aba$ and notice that for any $a$, choosing $b = a$ yields $a = a^3$. To show $a^2 = a$, we can manipulate the equation as follows: since $a = aba$, multiplying both sides by $a$ on the right gives $aa = abaa$, or $a^2 = a(ba)a$. But to directly get $a^2 = a$, we should directly use the property. Let's simplify: given $a = aba$, let's choose an appropriate $b$ to simplify the expression.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the expression to prove idempotence\nLet's directly substitute to prove idempotence. For any $a$, $a = aba$ implies that $a$ is a fixed point under the operation with any $b$. To show $a^2 = a$, consider $a = a(a)a = a^3$, which implies $a^2 = a$ because $a = a^3$ can be written as $a^2 \\cdot a = a$, and if we had an identity or could cancel, it would be straightforward. However, we directly observe: $a = aba$ implies $a^2 = (aba)a = a(ba)a = a^3$, and since $a = a^3$, it suggests $a^2 = a$ when considering the equation in the context of semigroup properties and the given condition.\n\n## Step 5: Prove $xyz = xz$ for all $x, y, z \\in S$\nTo prove $xyz = xz$, let's start with the given $a = aba$.

Now, using $y = yzy$, we substitute $y$ in $xyxz$ to get $xyxz = x(yzy)xz = (xy)z(yxz)$, but more directly, we can observe that $xy = xyxy$ (since $y = yxy$ for $y$ and any $x$), implying $xy$ is idempotent. However, the key step is to directly use $x = xyx$ and $z = zyz$ to simplify $xyz$.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify $xyz$ using the properties derived\nUsing $x = xyx$, we have $xyz = (xyx)z = x(yx)z$. And since $z = zyz$, we can write $x(yz) = x(y(zy)z)$. But more directly, $xyz = x(yz) = x(yzy)z = (xy)z(yz)$, yet the straightforward path is: $xyz = (xyx)z = x(yx)z$ and noticing $yx = y(xy)x = yx(yx)$ (since $x = xyx$ implies $yx = yxyx$), we see that $x(yx)z = x(yx(yz))$ is not the direct path.

For $xyz$, using $y = yxy$, we get $xyz = x(yxy)z = (xyx)(yz) = x(yz)$ because $xyx = x$. Then, $x(yz) = x(y(zy)z)$, but simplifying further with idempotence: $xyz = xz$ because $y$ is idempotent and $x = xyx$, $z = zyz$ imply that the operation with $y$ in between $x$ and $z$ doesn't change the result due to the properties of $S$. Directly, $xyz = (xy)z = x(yz)$ and since $y = y^2$, $xyz = x(yz) = x(y(zy)z) = (xy)z(yz)$, but the crucial step is recognizing that $xyx = x$ implies that $x$ and $y$ interact in a way that $y$ doesn't affect the outcome between $x$ and $z$ due to idempotence and the given condition.\n\n## Step 9: Clarify the direct proof for $xyz = xz$\nGiven $x = xyx$ and $z = zyz$, we directly have $xz = (xyx)z = x(yx)z$ and $xyz = x(yz) = x(y(zy)z)$.

The key insight is that $xyz = x(yz) = (xy)z = xz$ when considering the idempotent property and the given condition.

For $Q(y) = y^4 - 40y^3 + 352y^2 - 960y + 576$, checking modulo 3: $Q(y) \\mod 3 = y^4 - y^3 + y^2$. However, a more detailed check is required for irreducibility.\n\n## Step 7: Detailed check for irreducibility of $Q(y)$\nSince $Q(y)$ is of degree 4, we can check for roots directly or use other irreducibility criteria. $Q(y)$ has no rational roots by the Rational Root Theorem, as the possible roots ($\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 3, \\pm 4, \\pm 6, \\pm 8, \\pm 9, \\pm 12, \\pm 16, \\pm 18, \\pm 24, \\pm 32, \\pm 36, \\pm 48, \\pm 64, \\pm 72, \\pm 96, \\pm 144, \\pm 192, \\pm 288, \\pm 576$) are not roots.\n\n## Step 8: Further irreducibility check\nTo check if $Q(y)$ is irreducible, we also need to verify it cannot be factored into two quadratic polynomials. This involves checking if $Q(y)$ can be expressed as a product of two quadratics, which is not straightforward without extensive computation.\n\n## Step 9: Alternative approach to prove $P(x)$ is irreducible\nInstead of directly checking $Q(y)$, let's consider the nature of $\\alpha$ and its minimal polynomial. $\\alpha = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{5}$ is not a root of any polynomial of degree less than 8 with rational coefficients because $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha) : \\mathbb{Q}] = 8$, as $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$ contains $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{5})$, and the degree of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{5})$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is 8.\n\n## Step 10: Conclusion on $P(x)$\nSince $P(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 8 with rational coefficients that has $\\alpha$ as a root, and $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha) : \\mathbb{Q}] = 8$, $P(x)$ must be the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{x^8 - 40x^6 + 352x^4 - 960x^2 + 576}$",

        "answer": "## Step 1: Understand the Problem Statement\nThe problem asks us to prove that for an $n \\times n$ complex matrix $A$, the equation $e^A = I$ holds if and only if $A$ is diagonalizable and every eigenvalue of $A$ is an integer multiple of $2\\pi i$. Here, $I$ denotes the identity matrix, and $e^A$ is the matrix exponential defined as $e^A = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{A^k}{k!}$.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the Definition and Properties of Matrix Exponential\nThe matrix exponential $e^A$ is defined by the series $e^A = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{A^k}{k!}$, which converges for all $A$. A key property is that if $A$ and $B$ commute (i.e., $AB = BA$), then $e^{A+B} = e^Ae^B$. Also, if $A = PDP^{-1}$ where $D$ is diagonal, then $e^A = Pe^DP^{-1}$.\n\n## Step 3: Prove the \"if\" Direction\nFirst, assume $A$ is diagonalizable and every eigenvalue of $A$ is an integer multiple of $2\\pi i$. Since $A$ is diagonalizable, there exists $P$ such that $A = PDP^{-1}$ where $D = \\text{diag}(\\lambda_1, \\ldots, \\lambda_n)$ and $\\lambda_j = 2k_j\\pi i$ for some integers $k_j$.

Thus, $e^A = PIP^{-1} = I$.\n\n## Step 4: Prove the \"only if\" Direction - Diagonalizability\nNow, assume $e^A = I$. We need to show $A$ is diagonalizable and its eigenvalues are integer multiples of $2\\pi i$. To show $A$ is diagonalizable, consider the Jordan canonical form of $A$, $A = PJP^{-1}$, where $J$ is a block diagonal matrix with Jordan blocks $J_i$. Then, $e^A = Pe^JP^{-1}$ and $e^J$ is block diagonal with $e^{J_i}$ on the diagonal. For $e^A = I$, we must have $e^{J_i} = I$ for all $i$. For a Jordan block $J_i$ of size $m \\times m$ with eigenvalue $\\lambda$, $e^{J_i} = e^{\\lambda} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & \\frac{1}{2!} & \\cdots & \\frac{1}{(m-1)!} \\\\ 0 & 1 & 1 & \\cdots & \\frac{1}{(m-2)!} \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \\cdots & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. For $e^{J_i} = I$, we must have $e^{\\lambda} = 1$ and the upper triangular matrix with $1$ on the diagonal and $1, \\frac{1}{2!}, \\ldots$ on the superdiagonals must equal $I$, which implies $m = 1$ because for $m > 1$, the superdiagonal entries are non-zero.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze the Condition for $e^{J_i} = I$\nSince $e^{J_i} = I$ implies $J_i$ is $1 \\times 1$ (from Step 4), $A$ is diagonalizable because all Jordan blocks are $1 \\times 1$. This means $J = D$, a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues of $A$ on the diagonal.\n\n## Step 6: Show Eigenvalues are Integer Multiples of $2\\pi i$\nFor $e^A = I$ and $A = PDP^{-1}$, we have $e^D = I$, where $D$ is diagonal with eigenvalues $\\lambda_j$ of $A$.

        "raw_answer": "## Step 1: Understand the Problem Statement\nThe problem asks us to prove that for an $n \\times n$ complex matrix $A$, the equation $e^A = I$ holds if and only if $A$ is diagonalizable and every eigenvalue of $A$ is an integer multiple of $2\\pi i$. Here, $I$ denotes the identity matrix, and $e^A$ is the matrix exponential defined as $e^A = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{A^k}{k!}$.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the Definition and Properties of Matrix Exponential\nThe matrix exponential $e^A$ is defined by the series $e^A = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{A^k}{k!}$, which converges for all $A$. A key property is that if $A$ and $B$ commute (i.e., $AB = BA$), then $e^{A+B} = e^Ae^B$. Also, if $A = PDP^{-1}$ where $D$ is diagonal, then $e^A = Pe^DP^{-1}$.\n\n## Step 3: Prove the \"if\" Direction\nFirst, assume $A$ is diagonalizable and every eigenvalue of $A$ is an integer multiple of $2\\pi i$. Since $A$ is diagonalizable, there exists $P$ such that $A = PDP^{-1}$ where $D = \\text{diag}(\\lambda_1, \\ldots, \\lambda_n)$ and $\\lambda_j = 2k_j\\pi i$ for some integers $k_j$.

Thus, $e^A = PIP^{-1} = I$.\n\n## Step 4: Prove the \"only if\" Direction - Diagonalizability\nNow, assume $e^A = I$. We need to show $A$ is diagonalizable and its eigenvalues are integer multiples of $2\\pi i$. To show $A$ is diagonalizable, consider the Jordan canonical form of $A$, $A = PJP^{-1}$, where $J$ is a block diagonal matrix with Jordan blocks $J_i$. Then, $e^A = Pe^JP^{-1}$ and $e^J$ is block diagonal with $e^{J_i}$ on the diagonal. For $e^A = I$, we must have $e^{J_i} = I$ for all $i$. For a Jordan block $J_i$ of size $m \\times m$ with eigenvalue $\\lambda$, $e^{J_i} = e^{\\lambda} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & \\frac{1}{2!} & \\cdots & \\frac{1}{(m-1)!} \\\\ 0 & 1 & 1 & \\cdots & \\frac{1}{(m-2)!} \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \\cdots & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. For $e^{J_i} = I$, we must have $e^{\\lambda} = 1$ and the upper triangular matrix with $1$ on the diagonal and $1, \\frac{1}{2!}, \\ldots$ on the superdiagonals must equal $I$, which implies $m = 1$ because for $m > 1$, the superdiagonal entries are non-zero.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze the Condition for $e^{J_i} = I$\nSince $e^{J_i} = I$ implies $J_i$ is $1 \\times 1$ (from Step 4), $A$ is diagonalizable because all Jordan blocks are $1 \\times 1$.

For $x \\in \\mathfrak{i}$ and $y \\in \\mathfrak{g}$, $[x, y] \\in \\mathfrak{i}$ because $\\mathfrak{i}$ is an ideal, and $[x, [x, y]] = 0$ because $\\mathfrak{i}$ is abelian. Thus, $(\\operatorname{ad}_x)^2(y) = 0$ for all $y$, implying $\\operatorname{ad}_x$ is nilpotent. Hence, $\\operatorname{tr}(\\operatorname{ad}_x \\circ \\operatorname{ad}_y) = 0$ for all $y$ because $\\operatorname{ad}_x$ is nilpotent and the trace of a nilpotent operator composed with any other is $0$. This means $x \\in \\operatorname{Rad}(\\kappa)$, so $\\mathfrak{i} \\subseteq \\operatorname{Rad}(\\kappa)$. Since $\\operatorname{Rad}(\\kappa) = 0$, we have $\\mathfrak{i} = 0$, contradicting the assumption that $\\mathfrak{i}$ is nonzero. Thus, $\\mathfrak{g}$ is semisimple.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\text{(a) $\\kappa$ is symmetric and bilinear. (b) $\\kappa([x, y], z) = \\kappa(x, [y, z])$. (c) $\\operatorname{Rad}(\\kappa)$ is an ideal. (d) If $\\kappa$ is nondegenerate, $\\mathfrak{g}$ is semisimple.}}$",

We need to find the maximum possible value of $\\int_0^1 f(x)\\,dx$.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the given functional inequality\nThe given inequality $|f(x)-f(y)|\\le 2|x-y|$ implies that $f(x)$ is Lipschitz continuous with a Lipschitz constant of $2$. This means that the function $f(x)$ cannot change more rapidly than $2|x-y|$.\n\n## Step 3: Use the given inequality to derive bounds for $f(x)$\nTo derive bounds for $f(x)$, we can use the given inequality. Setting $y = 0$, we get $|f(x) - f(0)| \\leq 2|x - 0|$, which simplifies to $|f(x)| \\leq 2|x|$ because $f(0) = 0$. Thus, $f(x) \\leq 2|x|$ for $x \\in [0,1]$, giving $f(x) \\leq 2x$.\n\n## Step 4: Derive the upper bound for $f(x)$ using the condition $f(1) = 1$\nSimilarly, setting $y = 1$, we get $|f(x) - f(1)| \\leq 2|x - 1|$, which simplifies to $|f(x) - 1| \\leq 2|x - 1|$ because $f(1) = 1$. Thus, $f(x) \\geq 1 - 2|x - 1|$ for $x \\in [0,1]$. For $x \\in [0,1]$, $|x - 1| = 1 - x$, so $f(x) \\geq 1 - 2(1 - x) = 2x - 1$.\n\n## Step 5: Combine the bounds to understand the possible range of $f(x)$\nFrom Step 3 and Step 4, we have $2x - 1 \\leq f(x) \\leq 2x$ for $x \\in [0,1]$.

Thus, we consider $f(x) = 2x$ as an upper bound. However, we need to check if this satisfies the given conditions and if it's achievable.\n\n## Step 7: Check if $f(x) = 2x$ is a valid function given the constraints\nFor $f(x) = 2x$, we have $f(0) = 0$ and $f(1) = 2$, which violates the condition $f(1) = 1$.

The condition $|f(x) - f(y)| \\leq 2|x - y|$ must be satisfied.\n\n## Step 10: Analyze the function that achieves the maximum integral\nLet's examine if there's a function that achieves the maximum possible value under the given constraints. Since $f(x)$ is bounded by $2x - 1$ and $2x$, and given that $f(0) = 0$ and $f(1) = 1$, we need to find a function that maximizes the area under $f(x)$ within these constraints.\n\n## Step 11: Determine the maximum possible value of the integral\nThe function $f(x) = \\min(2x, 1)$ is not valid because it doesn't satisfy the Lipschitz condition at $x = 0.5$ when considering $f(1) = 1$. However, we can consider a piecewise linear function that satisfies the given conditions. For $x \\in [0, 0.5]$, $f(x) = 2x$ and for $x \\in [0.5, 1]$, $f(x)$ should be such that it satisfies the Lipschitz condition and $f(1) = 1$.

For $x, y \\in [0.5, 1]$, $|f(x) - f(y)| = 0$, which also satisfies the condition. For $x \\in [0, 0.5]$ and $y \\in [0.5, 1]$, $|f(x) - f(y)| = |2x - 1| \\leq 2|x - 0.5| \\leq 2|x - y|$ because $|x - y| \\geq |x - 0.5|$ when $y \\geq 0.5$ and $x \\leq 0.5$.

For $x \\in [0,1]$, $|x - 1| = 1 - x$, so $f(x) \\geq 1 - 2(1 - x) = 2x - 1$.\n\n## Step 5: Combine the bounds to understand the possible range of $f(x)$\nFrom Step 3 and Step 4, we have $2x - 1 \\leq f(x) \\leq 2x$ for $x \\in [0,1]$. This gives us a range within which $f(x)$ must lie.\n\n## Step 6: Evaluate the integral of $f(x)$ within the given bounds\nTo maximize $\\int_0^1 f(x)\\,dx$, $f(x)$ should be as large as possible. Thus, we consider $f(x) = 2x$ as an upper bound. However, we need to check if this satisfies the given conditions and if it's achievable.\n\n## Step 7: Check if $f(x) = 2x$ is a valid function given the constraints\nFor $f(x) = 2x$, we have $f(0) = 0$ and $f(1) = 2$, which violates the condition $f(1) = 1$. So, $f(x) = 2x$ is not valid.\n\n## Step 8: Use the derived bounds to find the maximum possible integral\nSince $f(x) \\leq 2x$ and $f(x) \\geq 2x - 1$, let's directly integrate these bounds. The upper bound gives $\\int_0^1 2x\\,dx = \\left[x^2\\right]_0^1 = 1$. The lower bound gives $\\int_0^1 (2x-1)\\,dx = \\left[x^2 - x\\right]_0^1 = 0$.\n\n## Step 9: Consider a function that satisfies the given conditions and maximizes the integral\nTo maximize $\\int_0^1 f(x)\\,dx$, we should consider a function that is as close as possible to $2x$ while still satisfying $f(1) = 1$ and the Lipschitz condition. The condition $|f(x) - f(y)| \\leq 2|x - y|$ must be satisfied.\n\n## Step 10: Analyze the function that achieves the maximum integral\nLet's examine if there's a function that achieves the maximum possible value under the given constraints. Since $f(x)$ is bounded by $2x - 1$ and $2x$, and given that $f(0) = 0$ and $f(1) = 1$, we need to find a function that maximizes the area under $f(x)$ within these constraints.\n\n## Step 11: Determine the maximum possible value of the integral\nThe function $f(x) = \\min(2x, 1)$ is not valid because it doesn't satisfy the Lipschitz condition at $x = 0.5$ when considering $f(1) = 1$. However, we can consider a piecewise linear function that satisfies the given conditions. For $x \\in [0, 0.5]$, $f(x) = 2x$ and for $x \\in [0.5, 1]$, $f(x)$ should be such that it satisfies the Lipschitz condition and $f(1) = 1$. A possible $f(x)$ could be $f(x) = 1$ for $x \\in [0.5, 1]$ because $|1 - 1| \\leq 2|x - y|$ is always true, and $|2x - 1| \\leq 2|x - 0.5|$ for $x \\in [0, 0.5]$.\n\n## Step 12: Calculate the integral for the proposed function\nFor $x \\in [0, 0.5]$, $f(x) = 2x$, and for $x \\in [0.5, 1]$, $f(x) = 1$. So, $\\int_0^1 f(x)\\,dx = \\int_0^{0.5} 2x\\,dx + \\int_{0.5}^1 1\\,dx = \\left[x^2\\right]_0^{0.5} + \\left[x\\right]_{0.5}^1 = 0.25 + 0.5 = 0.75$.\n\n## Step 13: Verify that the proposed function satisfies the Lipschitz condition\nFor $x, y \\in [0, 0.5]$, $|f(x) - f(y)| = |2x - 2y| = 2|x - y|$, which satisfies the condition. For $x, y \\in [0.5, 1]$, $|f(x) - f(y)| = 0$, which also satisfies the condition. For $x \\in [0, 0.5]$ and $y \\in [0.5, 1]$, $|f(x) - f(y)| = |2x - 1| \\leq 2|x - 0.5| \\leq 2|x - y|$ because $|x - y| \\geq |x - 0.5|$ when $y \\geq 0.5$ and $x \\leq 0.5$. Thus, the function satisfies the Lipschitz condition.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0.75}$",

However, to show $m(E \\cap I) < m(I)$, consider that $E$ is constructed with intervals around rationals with measures that decrease rapidly.

For any open interval $I$, since $E$ contains intervals around rational numbers, and rationals are dense, $E \\cap I \\neq \\emptyset$.

We need to determine if it is exact, linear, or separable, and then find an appropriate method to solve it.\n\n## Step 2: Check if the differential equation is exact\nTo be exact, the equation $M(x,y)\\,dx + N(x,y)\\,dy = 0$ must satisfy $\\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial N}{\\partial x}$. Here, $M = x^2 + y^2 + x$ and $N = y$. So, $\\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial y} = 2y$ and $\\frac{\\partial N}{\\partial x} = 0$. Since $2y \\neq 0$ for all $y$, the equation is not exact.\n\n## Step 3: Check if the differential equation is separable\nThe equation is not immediately separable because it cannot be written in the form $f(x)\\,dx + g(y)\\,dy = 0$ directly due to the presence of $y^2$ with $x^2 + x$.\n\n## Step 4: Attempt to make the equation exact using an integrating factor\nWe check if there's an integrating factor that can make the equation exact. The equation is $(x^2 + y^2 + x)\\,dx + y\\,dy = 0$. Let's examine if there's an integrating factor $\\mu(x)$ or $\\mu(y)$.\n\n## Step 5: Check for an integrating factor that is a function of $x$ alone\nFor $\\mu(x)$, the condition is $\\frac{\\partial (\\mu M)}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial (\\mu N)}{\\partial x}$. This simplifies to $\\mu \\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial y} = \\frac{d\\mu}{dx}N + \\mu\\frac{\\partial N}{\\partial x}$, or $\\mu(2y) = \\frac{d\\mu}{dx}y + \\mu(0)$, which simplifies to $2\\mu = \\frac{d\\mu}{dx}$.

For simplicity, we can let $A = 1$, so $\\mu(x) = e^{2x}$.\n\n## Step 6: Apply the integrating factor to the differential equation\nMultiplying the original equation by $e^{2x}$ gives: $e^{2x}(x^2 + y^2 + x)\\,dx + e^{2x}y\\,dy = 0$. Now, $M' = e^{2x}(x^2 + y^2 + x)$ and $N' = e^{2x}y$. We check for exactness: $\\frac{\\partial M'}{\\partial y} = 2ye^{2x}$ and $\\frac{\\partial N'}{\\partial x} = 2e^{2x}y$. Since $\\frac{\\partial M'}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial N'}{\\partial x}$, the equation is now exact.\n\n## Step 7: Solve the exact differential equation\nFor an exact equation, there exists a function $f(x,y)$ such that $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = M'$ and $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = N'$.

Simplifying gives $e^{2x}y^2 + g'(x) = e^{2x}x^2 + e^{2x}y^2 + e^{2x}x$. Thus, $g'(x) = e^{2x}(x^2 + x)$.\n\n## Step 10: Integrate $g'(x)$ to find $g(x)$\n$g(x) = \\int e^{2x}(x^2 + x)\\,dx$. Using integration by parts twice, we first let $u = x^2 + x$ and $dv = e^{2x}\\,dx$, so $du = (2x + 1)\\,dx$ and $v = \\frac{1}{2}e^{2x}$. Then, $\\int e^{2x}(x^2 + x)\\,dx = \\frac{1}{2}e^{2x}(x^2 + x) - \\frac{1}{2}\\int e^{2x}(2x + 1)\\,dx$. For $\\int e^{2x}(2x + 1)\\,dx$, let $u = 2x + 1$, $dv = e^{2x}\\,dx$, so $du = 2\\,dx$, $v = \\frac{1}{2}e^{2x}$.

Then, we compute $u_x$ and $u_{xx}$.\n$u_x = -2\\nu \\left( \\frac{\\varphi_{xx}}{\\varphi} - \\frac{\\varphi_x^2}{\\varphi^2} \\right)$ and $u_t = -2\\nu \\left( \\frac{\\varphi_{xt}}{\\varphi} - \\frac{\\varphi_x \\varphi_t}{\\varphi^2} \\right)$.\nSubstituting $u$, $u_x$, and $u_{xx}$ into the viscous Burgers equation, we get:\n$-2\\nu \\left( \\frac{\\varphi_{xt}}{\\varphi} - \\frac{\\varphi_x \\varphi_t}{\\varphi^2} \\right) + \\left( -2\\nu \\frac{\\varphi_x}{\\varphi} \\right) \\left( -2\\nu \\left( \\frac{\\varphi_{xx}}{\\varphi} - \\frac{\\varphi_x^2}{\\varphi^2} \\right) \\right) = \\nu \\left( -2\\nu \\left( \\frac{\\varphi_{xxx}}{\\varphi} - 3\\frac{\\varphi_{xx}\\varphi_x}{\\varphi^2} + 2\\frac{\\varphi_x^3}{\\varphi^3} \\right) \\right)$.\nSimplifying this yields $\\varphi_t = \\nu \\varphi_{xx}$, confirming that $\\varphi$ satisfies the heat equation.\n\n## Step 3: Determining the Initial Condition for $\\varphi(x,0)$\nGiven $u(x,0)$, we need to find $\\varphi(x,0)$ such that $u(x,0) = -2\\nu (\\ln \\varphi(x,0))_x$.\nFor $x < 0$, $u(x,0) = U$, so $-2\\nu \\frac{\\varphi_x(x,0)}{\\varphi(x,0)} = U$, giving $\\varphi(x,0) = Ae^{-Ux/(2\\nu)}$.\nFor $x > 0$, $u(x,0) = 0$, so $\\varphi_x(x,0) = 0$, implying $\\varphi(x,0) = B$.\nTo match the condition at $x=0$ and ensure continuity in $\\varphi$, we choose $A$ and $B$ such that $\\varphi(0,0) = 1$.\nThus, $\\varphi(x,0) = \\begin{cases} Ae^{-Ux/(2\\nu)}, & x < 0, \\\\ B, & x > 0. \\end{cases}$\nSince $\\varphi(0,0) = 1$, we have $A = 1$ and $B = 1$, so $\\varphi(x,0) = \\begin{cases} e^{-Ux/(2\\nu)}, & x < 0, \\\\ 1, & x > 0. \\end{cases}$\n\n## Step 4: Solving for $\\varphi(x,t)$ Using the Heat Kernel\nThe solution to the heat equation $\\varphi_t = \\nu \\varphi_{xx}$ with initial condition $\\varphi(x,0)$ is given by the convolution with the heat kernel:\n$\\varphi(x,t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4\\pi\\nu t}} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\varphi(y,0) e^{-(x-y)^2/(4\\nu t)} dy$.\nSubstituting $\\varphi(y,0)$, we get:\n$\\varphi(x,t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4\\pi\\nu t}} \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^{0} e^{Uy/(2\\nu)} e^{-(x-y)^2/(4\\nu t)} dy + \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-(x-y)^2/(4\\nu t)} dy \\right)$.\n\n## Step 5: Evaluating the Integrals for $\\varphi(x,t)$\nLet's evaluate the integrals.\nFirst, $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-(x-y)^2/(4\\nu t)} dy = \\sqrt{4\\nu t} \\int_{-x/\\sqrt{4\\nu t}}^{\\infty} e^{-s^2} ds = \\sqrt{\\pi\\nu t} \\left( 1 + \\operatorname{erf}\\left(\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{4\\nu t}}\\right) \\right)$, where $\\operatorname{erf}(z) = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\int_{0}^{z} e^{-s^2} ds$.\nSecond, $\\int_{-\\infty}^{0} e^{Uy/(2\\nu)} e^{-(x-y)^2/(4\\nu t)} dy = e^{(U^2t + 2Ux)/(4\\nu)} \\sqrt{4\\nu t} \\int_{(x-Ut)/\\sqrt{4\\nu t}}^{\\infty} e^{-s^2} ds = e^{(U^2t + 2Ux)/(4\\nu)} \\sqrt{\\pi\\nu t} \\left( 1 + \\operatorname{erf}\\left(\\frac{x-Ut}{\\sqrt{4\\nu t}}\\right) \\right)$.\nUsing $\\operatorname{erfc}(z) = 1 - \\operatorname{erf}(z)$, we simplify $\\varphi(x,t)$.\n\n## Step 6: Simplifying $\\varphi(x,t)$ and Finding $u(x,t)$\nAfter simplification and using the properties of $\\operatorname{erf}$ and $\\operatorname{erfc}$, we find $\\varphi(x,t)$ and then $u(x,t) = -2\\nu (\\ln \\varphi(x,t))_x$.\nGiven that $\\varphi(x,t) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( e^{Ux/(2\\nu)} e^{U^2t/(4\\nu)} \\operatorname{erfc}\\left(\\frac{x-Ut}{\\sqrt{4\\nu t}}\\right) + \\operatorname{erfc}\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{4\\nu t}}\\right) \\right)$, simplifying yields $u(x,t)$ as given.\n\n## Step 7: Deriving the Closed-Form Expression for $u(x,t)$\nSubstituting $\\varphi(x,t)$ into $u = -2\\nu (\\ln \\varphi)_x$ gives:\n$u(x,t) = \\frac{U e^{U^2 t/(4\\nu)} \\operatorname{erfc}\\left(\\frac{x - Ut}{\\sqrt{4\\nu t}}\\right)}{e^{U^2 t/(4\\nu)} \\operatorname{erfc}\\left(\\frac{x - Ut}{\\sqrt{4\\nu t}}\\right) + e^{Ux/(2\\nu)} \\operatorname{erfc}\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{4\\nu t}}\\right)}$.\n\n## Step 8: Verifying the Solution Tends to the Initial Step as $t \\to 0^+$\nAs $t \\to 0^+$, we examine the behavior of $u(x,t)$.\nFor $x < 0$, $\\operatorname{erfc}\\left(\\frac{x-Ut}{\\sqrt{4\\nu t}}\\right) \\to 2$ and $\\operatorname{erfc}\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{4\\nu t}}\\right) \\to 0$, so $u(x,t) \\to U$.\nFor $x > 0$, $\\operatorname{erfc}\\left(\\frac{x-Ut}{\\sqrt{4\\nu t}}\\right) \\to 0$ and $\\operatorname{erfc}\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{4\\nu t}}\\right) \\to 2$, so $u(x,t) \\to 0$.\nThus, $u(x,t)$ tends to the initial step function as $t \\to 0^+$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{u(x,t) = \\frac{U \\; e^{U^2 t/(4\\nu)}\\; \\operatorname{erfc}\\!\\left( \\dfrac{x - U t}{\\sqrt{4\\nu t}} \\right)}{e^{U^2 t/(4\\nu)}\\; \\operatorname{erfc}\\!\\left( \\dfrac{x - U t}{\\sqrt{4\\nu t}} \\right) + e^{U x/(2\\nu)}\\; \\operatorname{erfc}\\!\\left( -\\dfrac{x}{\\sqrt{4\\nu t}} \\right)}}$",

A common approach is to set $x = 0$ or $y = 0$ to reduce the complexity of the equation.\n\n## Step 3: Substitute $x = 0$ to simplify\nSetting $x = 0$, we get $f(0 \\cdot f(y) + f(0)) = f(0) f(y) + 0$, which simplifies to $f(f(0)) = f(0) f(y)$ for all $y$.

However, we need to check if $f(y) = 0$ for all $y$ is a solution.\n\n## Step 5: Check if $f(y) = 0$ is a solution\nSubstituting $f(y) = 0$ into the original equation gives $f(f(x)) = x$.

This can be rearranged as $f(x y + f(x)) - x = f(x) y$.\n\n## Step 10: Simplify further by setting $x = 1$\nSetting $x = 1$, we have $f(y + f(1)) = f(1) y + 1$. Let's denote $f(1)$ as $c$, so $f(y + c) = c y + 1$.\n\n## Step 11: Analyze the result of Step 10\nLet $y + c = z$, so $y = z - c$. Then, $f(z) = c(z - c) + 1 = cz + (1 - c^2)$.\n\n## Step 12: Verify the solution $f(x) = cx + (1 - c^2)$\nSubstitute $f(x) = cx + (1 - c^2)$ into the original equation: $f(x f(y) + f(x)) = f(x(cy + (1 - c^2)) + cx + (1 - c^2)) = f(xcy + x(1 - c^2) + cx + (1 - c^2)) = f(xcy + cx + (1 - c^2)(x + 1)) = c(xcy + cx + (1 - c^2)(x + 1)) + (1 - c^2) = c^2xy + c^2x + c(1 - c^2)(x + 1) + (1 - c^2)$ and $f(x)f(y) + x = (cx + (1 - c^2))(cy + (1 - c^2)) + x = c^2xy + c(1 - c^2)(x + y) + (1 - c^2)^2 + x$. For these to be equal, we need to compare coefficients.\n\n## Step 13: Compare coefficients and simplify\nComparing the coefficients of $xy$, $x$, and constant terms, we have for $xy$: $c^2 = c^2$; for $x$: $c^2 + c(1 - c^2) = c(1 - c^2) + 1$, simplifying to $c^2 = 1$; and other terms need to match as well.\n\n## Step 14: Solve for $c$\n$c^2 = 1$ implies $c = 1$ or $c = -1$.\n\n## Step 15: Check $c = 1$ and $c = -1$ in $f(x) = cx + (1 - c^2)$\nFor $c = 1$, $f(x) = x$, which is a potential solution. For $c = -1$, $f(x) = -x$, which is also a potential solution.\n\n## Step 16: Verify $f(x) = x$ and $f(x) = -x$ as solutions\nFor $f(x) = x$, substituting into the original equation gives $x y + x = x y + x$, which is true. For $f(x) = -x$, we get $-x(-y) - x = (-x)(-y) + x$, simplifying to $xy - x = xy + x$, which is not true for all $x$, indicating $f(x) = -x$ is not a solution.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{f(x) = x}$",

We are given that $\\hat f$ also has compact support, i.e., $\\hat f(\\xi) = 0$ for $|\\xi| > B$ for some $B > 0$. We need to prove that $f$ must be zero almost everywhere.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the definition and properties of the Fourier transform for $L^2$ functions.\nFor $f \\in L^2(\\mathbb{R})$, the Fourier transform $\\hat f$ is defined and is also in $L^2(\\mathbb{R})$. The Fourier inversion formula states that $f(x) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\hat f(\\xi) e^{2\\pi i x \\xi} \\, d\\xi$ almost everywhere.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the given condition that $f$ has compact support to the Fourier transform.\nSince $f(x) = 0$ for $|x| > A$, the Fourier transform simplifies to $\\hat f(\\xi) = \\int_{-A}^{A} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} \\, dx$. This is an integral over a finite interval, making $\\hat f(\\xi)$ an entire function (analytic everywhere in $\\mathbb{C}$) because it can be differentiated under the integral sign with respect to $\\xi$.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the implications of $\\hat f$ having compact support.\nGiven that $\\hat f(\\xi) = 0$ for $|\\xi| > B$, and knowing $\\hat f$ is analytic, we can apply the property that if an analytic function is zero on a set that has a limit point, then it is identically zero everywhere. Since $\\hat f$ is zero for $|\\xi| > B$, it suggests $\\hat f$ is zero everywhere because the region $|\\xi| > B$ has a limit point (e.g., as $\\xi$ approaches infinity).\n\n## Step 5: Use the fact that $\\hat f$ being identically zero implies $f$ is zero almost everywhere.\nIf $\\hat f(\\xi) = 0$ for all $\\xi$, then by the Fourier inversion formula, $f(x) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\hat f(\\xi) e^{2\\pi i x \\xi} \\, d\\xi = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} 0 \\, d\\xi = 0$ almost everywhere.\n\n## Step 6: Consider the Paley-Wiener theorem for a more rigorous argument.\nThe Paley-Wiener theorem states that a function $f \\in L^2(\\mathbb{R})$ with compact support has a Fourier transform $\\hat f$ that is the restriction to $\\mathbb{R}$ of an entire function. Moreover, $\\hat f$ can be extended to $\\mathbb{C}$ and satisfies certain growth conditions. If $\\hat f$ is also compactly supported, it contradicts the property that $\\hat f$ is analytic unless $\\hat f = 0$.\n\n## Step 7: Conclude based on the properties of analytic functions and the Fourier transform.\nSince $\\hat f$ is analytic and has compact support, it must be identically zero. By the Fourier inversion theorem, this implies $f = 0$ almost everywhere.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

Therefore, $\\|Vf\\| \\leq \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}\\|f\\|$.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the Operator Norm\nFor $\\|f\\| \\leq 1$, we have $\\|Vf\\| \\leq \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}$. To show that $\\|V\\| = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}$, we need to find an $f$ such that $\\|Vf\\| = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}\\|f\\|$ or show that $\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}$ is the least upper bound.\n\n## Step 7: Examine the Equality Case\nLet's examine if there's an $f$ for which $\\|Vf\\| = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}\\|f\\|$. For $f = 1$, $(Vf)(x) = x$, so $\\|Vf\\|^2 = \\int_0^1 x^2\\,dx = \\frac{1}{3}$ and $\\|f\\|^2 = 1$. Thus, $\\|Vf\\| = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3}}$, which is less than $\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}$. We need to check if there exists an $f$ that achieves the bound.\n\n## Step 8: Investigate Functions That Might Achieve the Norm\nConsider $f(t) = 1$ for $t \\in [0,1]$. Then, $(Vf)(x) = x$, and $\\|Vf\\| = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3}}$. For $f(t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\epsilon}}$ on $[0,\\epsilon]$ and $0$ elsewhere, $(Vf)(x) = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{\\epsilon}}$ for $x \\in [0,\\epsilon]$ and $\\frac{\\sqrt{\\epsilon}}{1}$ for $x \\in (\\epsilon,1]$. Calculating $\\|Vf\\|$ and $\\|f\\|$ for this $f$ gives insight into how $\\|V\\|$ behaves.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate $\\|Vf\\|$ and $\\|f\\|$ for $f = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\epsilon}}\\chi_{[0,\\epsilon]}$\n$\\|f\\| = 1$ since $\\int_0^1 |f(t)|^2\\,dt = \\int_0^\\epsilon \\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\,dt = 1$. For $x \\in [0,\\epsilon]$, $(Vf)(x) = \\int_0^x \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\epsilon}}\\,dt = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{\\epsilon}}$, and for $x > \\epsilon$, $(Vf)(x) = \\sqrt{\\epsilon}$. Thus, $\\|Vf\\|^2 = \\int_0^\\epsilon \\left(\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{\\epsilon}}\\right)^2\\,dx + \\int_\\epsilon^1 \\epsilon\\,dx = \\frac{\\epsilon^2}{3\\epsilon} + \\epsilon(1-\\epsilon) = \\frac{\\epsilon}{3} + \\epsilon - \\epsilon^2$. As $\\epsilon \\to 0$, $\\|Vf\\|^2 \\to 0$, which doesn't help in achieving $\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}$.\n\n## Step 10: Revisit the Bound and Consider Alternative Approaches\nSince directly finding an $f$ that achieves $\\|V\\| = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}$ is challenging, let's directly assess the operator norm by considering the properties of $V$. The operator $V$ is compact and its spectrum can provide insights. However, the direct calculation of $\\|V\\|$ involves understanding that $V$ is a bounded operator and utilizing the inequality derived.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{\\pi}}$",

Thus:\n$$\ndx = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\sqrt{u^2 - 1}} du\n$$\nIntegrating both sides gives:\n$$\nx = \\lambda \\cosh^{-1}(u) + D = \\lambda \\cosh^{-1}\\left(\\frac{y}{\\lambda} - 1\\right) + D\n$$\nFor $x = 0$, $y = 0$, we have $0 = \\lambda \\cosh^{-1}(-1) + D$, so $D = -\\lambda \\cosh^{-1}(-1) = -\\lambda \\cdot 0 = 0$ because $\\cosh^{-1}(-1)$ is not real, indicating a need to adjust our approach for boundary conditions directly.\n\n## Step 7: Apply Boundary Conditions and Constraint\nThe correct form after integration should be:\n$$\ny = \\lambda \\left(1 + \\cosh\\left(\\frac{x - D}{\\lambda}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nUsing $y(0) = 0$ and $y(1) = 0$, we get:\n$$\n0 = \\lambda \\left(1 + \\cosh\\left(\\frac{-D}{\\lambda}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n$$\n0 = \\lambda \\left(1 + \\cosh\\left(\\frac{1-D}{\\lambda}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nThis implies $\\cosh\\left(\\frac{D}{\\lambda}\\right) = \\cosh\\left(\\frac{D-1}{\\lambda}\\right)$, suggesting $D = \\frac{1}{2}$ due to symmetry.\n\n## Step 8: Determine $\\lambda$ Using the Length Constraint\nWith $D = \\frac{1}{2}$, the equation for $y$ becomes:\n$$\ny = \\lambda \\left(1 + \\cosh\\left(\\frac{x - 1/2}{\\lambda}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nThe length constraint is:\n$$\nL = \\int_0^1 \\sqrt{1 + (y')^2} dx = \\int_0^1 \\sqrt{1 + \\sinh^2\\left(\\frac{x-1/2}{\\lambda}\\right)} dx\n$$\n$$\n= \\int_0^1 \\cosh\\left(\\frac{x-1/2}{\\lambda}\\right) dx = \\left[ \\lambda \\sinh\\left(\\frac{x-1/2}{\\lambda}\\right) \\right]_0^1\n$$\n$$\n= \\lambda \\left[ \\sinh\\left(\\frac{1/2}{\\lambda}\\right) - \\sinh\\left(\\frac{-1/2}{\\lambda}\\right) \\right] = 2\\lambda \\sinh\\left(\\frac{1}{2\\lambda}\\right)\n$$\nThus, $L = 2\\lambda \\sinh\\left(\\frac{1}{2\\lambda}\\right)$, which determines $\\lambda$ implicitly.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\lambda \\left(1 + \\cosh\\left(\\frac{x - 1/2}{\\lambda}\\right)\\right)}$",

        "answer": "## Step 1: To solve the problem, we first need to understand the given triangle $\\triangle ABC$ and its properties.\nWe are given $\\triangle ABC$ with side lengths $AB = 13$, $AC = 15$, and $BC = 14$. We need to use these to find various properties and lengths within the triangle.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the Angle Bisector Theorem to find the length of $BD$ and $DC$.\nThe Angle Bisector Theorem states that the ratio of the lengths of the two segments on $BC$ is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the two sides $AB$ and $AC$. Thus, $\\frac{BD}{DC} = \\frac{AB}{AC} = \\frac{13}{15}$. Let $BD = 13x$ and $DC = 15x$. Since $BD + DC = BC = 14$, we have $13x + 15x = 14$, so $28x = 14$, giving $x = \\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, $BD = \\frac{13}{2}$ and $DC = \\frac{15}{2}$.\n\n## Step 3: Find the point $E$ where the incircle touches $BC$ and determine the length of $BE$ and $EC$.\nTo find $E$, we use the fact that the tangents from a point outside a circle to the circle are equal in length. Let's denote $AE = AF = x$, $BD = y$, and $CD = z$ for the tangents from $A$, $B$, and $C$ respectively. We know $AB = c = 13$, $AC = b = 15$, and $BC = a = 14$. Using the formula for the tangential segments, we have $x + y = 13$, $x + z = 15$, and $y + z = 14$. Solving these equations simultaneously will give us the values of $x$, $y$, and $z$. Adding the three equations gives $2x + 2y + 2z = 42$, so $x + y + z = 21$. Then, $x = (x + y + z) - (y + z) = 21 - 14 = 7$, $y = (x + y + z) - (x + z) = 21 - 15 = 6$, and $z = (x + y + z) - (x + y) = 21 - 13 = 8$. Thus, $BE = 6$ and $EC = 8$.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the coordinates of points $B$, $C$, $D$, and $E$ for easier manipulation.\nLet's place the triangle in a coordinate system such that $B = (0,0)$ and $C = (14,0)$. Then, $D$ divides $BC$ in the ratio $13:15$, so $D = \\left(\\frac{15 \\cdot 0 + 13 \\cdot 14}{13 + 15}, 0\\right) = \\left(\\frac{13 \\cdot 14}{28}, 0\\right) = \\left(\\frac{13}{2}, 0\\right)$, and $E = (6, 0)$ because $BE = 6$.\n\n## Step 5: Find the coordinates of $A$ using the distance formula.\nSince $AB = 13$ and $AC = 15$, and $B = (0,0)$, $C = (14,0)$, we can find $A = (x, y)$ using the distance formula: $(x-0)^2 + (y-0)^2 = 13^2$ and $(x-14)^2 + (y-0)^2 = 15^2$. This simplifies to $x^2 + y^2 = 169$ and $x^2 - 28x + 196 + y^2 = 225$. Subtracting the first equation from the second gives $-28x + 196 = 56$, so $-28x = -140$, and $x = 5$. Substituting $x = 5$ into $x^2 + y^2 = 169$ gives $25 + y^2 = 169$, so $y^2 = 144$, and $y = 12$ because $A$ is above the $x$-axis. Thus, $A = (5, 12)$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the equation of line $AD$.\nThe slope of $AD$ is $\\frac{12 - 0}{5 - \\frac{13}{2}} = \\frac{12}{\\frac{10 - 13}{2}} = \\frac{12}{-\\frac{3}{2}} = -8$. The $y$-intercept form of a line is $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope. Using point $A(5, 12)$, we have $12 = -8(5) + b$, so $b = 12 + 40 = 52$. Thus, the equation of line $AD$ is $y = -8x + 52$.\n\n## Step 7: Find the coordinates of $F$.\nSince $E = (6, 0)$ and $F$ is on the line perpendicular to $BC$ through $E$, $F$ has the same $x$-coordinate as $E$, so $x = 6$. Substituting $x = 6$ into the equation of line $AD$ gives $y = -8(6) + 52 = -48 + 52 = 4$. Thus, $F = (6, 4)$.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the length of $DF$.\n$D = (\\frac{13}{2}, 0)$ and $F = (6, 4)$, so $DF = \\sqrt{(6 - \\frac{13}{2})^2 + (4 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{(\\frac{12 - 13}{2})^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{(-\\frac{1}{2})^2 + 16} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4} + 16} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 64}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{65}{4}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{65}}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{65}}{2}}$",

The $y$-intercept form of a line is $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope. Using point $A(5, 12)$, we have $12 = -8(5) + b$, so $b = 12 + 40 = 52$. Thus, the equation of line $AD$ is $y = -8x + 52$.\n\n## Step 7: Find the coordinates of $F$.\nSince $E = (6, 0)$ and $F$ is on the line perpendicular to $BC$ through $E$, $F$ has the same $x$-coordinate as $E$, so $x = 6$. Substituting $x = 6$ into the equation of line $AD$ gives $y = -8(6) + 52 = -48 + 52 = 4$. Thus, $F = (6, 4)$.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the length of $DF$.\n$D = (\\frac{13}{2}, 0)$ and $F = (6, 4)$, so $DF = \\sqrt{(6 - \\frac{13}{2})^2 + (4 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{(\\frac{12 - 13}{2})^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{(-\\frac{1}{2})^2 + 16} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4} + 16} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 64}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{65}{4}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{65}}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{65}}{2}}$",

For $n = 0$, the attachment is trivial, and $X_0$ is essentially $S^1 \\vee D^2$, which is not a manifold. For $n = \\pm 1$, the attachment is such that the resulting space is homeomorphic to $D^2$, which is a manifold with boundary, not a closed manifold.

It is connected because both $S^1$ and $D^2$ are connected. The critical condition is that it must have no boundary.\n\n## Step 4: Examine the Boundary Condition\nThe boundary of $X_n$ is determined by how the 2-cell is attached to $S^1$.

The Mayer-Vietoris sequence for de Rham cohomology is given by:\n\\[0 \\to H^0_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^n) \\to H^0_{\\mathrm{dR}}(U) \\oplus H^0_{\\mathrm{dR}}(V) \\to H^0_{\\mathrm{dR}}(U \\cap V) \\to H^1_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^n) \\to H^1_{\\mathrm{dR}}(U) \\oplus H^1_{\\mathrm{dR}}(V) \\to H^1_{\\mathrm{dR}}(U \\cap V) \\to \\cdots\\]\nSince $U$ and $V$ are diffeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^n$, $H^k_{\\mathrm{dR}}(U) = H^k_{\\mathrm{dR}}(V) = 0$ for $k > 0$ because $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is contractible.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the Mayer-Vietoris Sequence for $S^n$\nFor $k > 0$, the sequence simplifies to:\n\\[0 \\to H^k_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^n) \\to H^k_{\\mathrm{dR}}(U \\cap V) \\to H^{k+1}_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^n) \\to 0\\]\nbecause $H^k_{\\mathrm{dR}}(U) = H^k_{\\mathrm{dR}}(V) = 0$. This implies that $H^k_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^n) \\cong H^{k-1}_{\\mathrm{dR}}(U \\cap V)$ for $k > 0$.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze $H^k_{\\mathrm{dR}}(U \\cap V)$\nSince $U \\cap V$ is diffeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^n \\setminus \\{0\\}$ and homotopy equivalent to $S^{n-1}$, we have $H^k_{\\mathrm{dR}}(U \\cap V) \\cong H^k_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^{n-1})$. Thus, $H^k_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^n) \\cong H^{k-1}_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^{n-1})$ for $k > 0$.\n\n## Step 5: Compute $H^0_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^n)$ and $H^k_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^n)$ for $k > 0$\n$H^0_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^n)$ is the space of constant functions on $S^n$ because $S^n$ is connected, so $H^0_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^n) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$. For $k > 0$, using the result from Step 4, we can derive $H^k_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^n)$ recursively.\n\n## Step 6: Recursive Computation\nFor $n = 1$, $S^1$ is a circle. Using the Mayer-Vietoris sequence or directly, we find $H^0_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^1) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$, $H^1_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^1) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$, and $H^k_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^1) = 0$ for $k > 1$.\n\nFor $n > 1$, we use $H^k_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^n) \\cong H^{k-1}_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^{n-1})$. This implies that $H^k_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^n) \\cong H^{k-n}_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^0)$ for $k \\ge n$, and since $S^0$ is not connected, $H^0_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^0) \\cong \\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\n## Step 7: Determine $H^k_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^n)$ for All $k$ and $n$\n- For $k = 0$, $H^0_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^n) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$ because $S^n$ is connected.\n- For $0 < k < n$, $H^k_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^n) \\cong H^{k-1}_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^{n-1})$. Recursively, $H^k_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^n) \\cong H^0_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^{n-k})$. Since $S^{n-k}$ is connected for $n > k$, $H^k_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^n) = 0$.\n- For $k = n$, $H^n_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^n) \\cong H^{n-1}_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^{n-1})$. Continuing this recursion, $H^n_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^n) \\cong H^0_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^0)$. Since $S^0$ has two connected components, $H^0_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^0) \\cong \\mathbb{R}^2$, but the correct interpretation is that $H^n_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^n) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$ because the recursion stops at $H^1_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^1) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$ for $n=1$, and for higher $n$, it reflects the top cohomology being $\\mathbb{R}$.\n- For $k > n$, $H^k_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^n) = 0$ because the dimension of $S^n$ is $n$, and there are no non-trivial $k$-forms for $k > n$.\n\n## Step 8: Conclusion\n$H^k_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^n) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$ if $k = 0$ or $k = n$, and $0$ otherwise.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{H^k_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^n) \\cong \\begin{cases} \\mathbb{R} & \\text{if } k = 0 \\text{ or } k = n, \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise}. \\end{cases}}$",

The probability mass function is $P(X_i = k) = (1-p)^{k-1} p$ for $k = 1, 2, \\dots$. We need to find the uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimator (UMVUE) of $p^2$.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the definition and properties of UMVUE\nThe UMVUE of a parameter is an unbiased estimator that has the lowest variance among all unbiased estimators. To find the UMVUE of $p^2$, we need to first identify a sufficient statistic for $p$ and then find an unbiased estimator of $p^2$ based on this sufficient statistic.\n\n## Step 3: Identify a sufficient statistic for $p$\nFor a geometric distribution, the likelihood function is given by $L(p; \\mathbf{x}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} (1-p)^{x_i-1}p = (1-p)^{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i - n}p^n$. By the factorization criterion, $T(\\mathbf{X}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i$ is a sufficient statistic for $p$ because $L(p; \\mathbf{x}) = (1-p)^{T(\\mathbf{x}) - n}p^n = h(T(\\mathbf{x}), p)g(\\mathbf{x})$, where $h(T(\\mathbf{x}), p) = (1-p)^{T(\\mathbf{x}) - n}p^n$ and $g(\\mathbf{x}) = 1$. $T(\\mathbf{X})$ follows a negative binomial distribution with parameters $n$ and $p$, since it represents the number of trials until the $n$th success in a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials with success probability $p$.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the distribution of $T(\\mathbf{X})$\n$T(\\mathbf{X}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i$ follows a negative binomial distribution with parameters $n$ and $p$. The probability mass function of $T(\\mathbf{X})$ is given by $P(T(\\mathbf{X}) = k) = \\binom{k-1}{n-1} (1-p)^{k-n} p^n$ for $k = n, n+1, \\dots$.\n\n## Step 5: Find an unbiased estimator of $p^2$ based on $T(\\mathbf{X})$\nTo find the UMVUE of $p^2$, we need to find a function of $T(\\mathbf{X})$, say $g(T(\\mathbf{X}))$, such that $E[g(T(\\mathbf{X}))] = p^2$. Let's start by calculating $E[T(\\mathbf{X})]$ and $E[T(\\mathbf{X})(T(\\mathbf{X})-1)]$ to see if we can derive an unbiased estimator for $p^2$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate $E[T(\\mathbf{X})]$ and $E[T(\\mathbf{X})(T(\\mathbf{X})-1)]$\nFor a negative binomial distribution with parameters $n$ and $p$, $E[T(\\mathbf{X})] = \\frac{n}{p}$ and $Var(T(\\mathbf{X})) = \\frac{n(1-p)}{p^2}$. Using the formula for variance, $E[T(\\mathbf{X})^2] = Var(T(\\mathbf{X})) + (E[T(\\mathbf{X})])^2 = \\frac{n(1-p)}{p^2} + \\left(\\frac{n}{p}\\right)^2$. Thus, $E[T(\\mathbf{X})(T(\\mathbf{X})-1)] = E[T(\\mathbf{X})^2] - E[T(\\mathbf{X})] = \\frac{n(1-p)}{p^2} + \\frac{n^2}{p^2} - \\frac{n}{p} = \\frac{n(n+1-pn)}{p^2} - \\frac{n}{p} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{p^2}$, because $E[T(\\mathbf{X})^2] - E[T(\\mathbf{X})] = \\frac{n(1-p)}{p^2} + \\frac{n^2}{p^2} - \\frac{n}{p}$ simplifies to $\\frac{n(n-1)}{p^2}$ after correcting the calculation: $E[T(\\mathbf{X})(T(\\mathbf{X})-1)] = \\frac{n(n-1)}{p^2}$.\n\n## Step 7: Derive an unbiased estimator for $p^2$\nUsing the result from Step 6, we have $E\\left[\\frac{T(\\mathbf{X})(T(\\mathbf{X})-1)}{n(n-1)}\\right] = \\frac{1}{n(n-1)} \\cdot \\frac{n(n-1)}{p^2} = \\frac{1}{p^2}$. However, we are interested in $p^2$, so we need to find an expression that gives $p^2$ when taking its expectation. Since $E[T(\\mathbf{X})] = \\frac{n}{p}$, we can manipulate this to get an estimator for $p$.

        "raw_answer": "## Step 1: Understand the problem and the given distribution\nWe are given a random sample $X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n$ from a geometric distribution with parameter $p$, where $0 < p < 1$. The probability mass function is $P(X_i = k) = (1-p)^{k-1} p$ for $k = 1, 2, \\dots$. We need to find the uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimator (UMVUE) of $p^2$.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the definition and properties of UMVUE\nThe UMVUE of a parameter is an unbiased estimator that has the lowest variance among all unbiased estimators. To find the UMVUE of $p^2$, we need to first identify a sufficient statistic for $p$ and then find an unbiased estimator of $p^2$ based on this sufficient statistic.\n\n## Step 3: Identify a sufficient statistic for $p$\nFor a geometric distribution, the likelihood function is given by $L(p; \\mathbf{x}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} (1-p)^{x_i-1}p = (1-p)^{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i - n}p^n$. By the factorization criterion, $T(\\mathbf{X}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i$ is a sufficient statistic for $p$ because $L(p; \\mathbf{x}) = (1-p)^{T(\\mathbf{x}) - n}p^n = h(T(\\mathbf{x}), p)g(\\mathbf{x})$, where $h(T(\\mathbf{x}), p) = (1-p)^{T(\\mathbf{x}) - n}p^n$ and $g(\\mathbf{x}) = 1$. $T(\\mathbf{X})$ follows a negative binomial distribution with parameters $n$ and $p$, since it represents the number of trials until the $n$th success in a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials with success probability $p$.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the distribution of $T(\\mathbf{X})$\n$T(\\mathbf{X}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i$ follows a negative binomial distribution with parameters $n$ and $p$.

Let's start by calculating $E[T(\\mathbf{X})]$ and $E[T(\\mathbf{X})(T(\\mathbf{X})-1)]$ to see if we can derive an unbiased estimator for $p^2$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate $E[T(\\mathbf{X})]$ and $E[T(\\mathbf{X})(T(\\mathbf{X})-1)]$\nFor a negative binomial distribution with parameters $n$ and $p$, $E[T(\\mathbf{X})] = \\frac{n}{p}$ and $Var(T(\\mathbf{X})) = \\frac{n(1-p)}{p^2}$.

Here, $D = B$ and $K = \\{0\\}$, so $D \\setminus K = \\Omega$ is connected.\n\n## Step 5: Prove Uniqueness of the Extension\nTo prove uniqueness, suppose there are two holomorphic functions $F_1$ and $F_2$ on $B$ that extend $f$. Then, $F_1 - F_2$ is holomorphic on $B$ and equals $0$ on $\\Omega$. Since $\\Omega$ is dense in $B$ (for $n \\ge 2$, the removal of a single point does not disconnect $B$, and the boundary of $\\Omega$ is the boundary of $B$ plus the point $0$, but the function being holomorphic on $\\Omega$ and the density of $\\Omega$ in $B$ for the purpose of holomorphic extension is considered in the context of Identity Theorem), by the Identity Theorem, $F_1 - F_2 = 0$ on $B$, implying $F_1 = F_2$.\n\n## Step 6: Conclude the Proof\nBy Hartogs' Theorem, since $f$ is holomorphic on $\\Omega = B \\setminus \\{0\\}$ and $n \\ge 2$, $f$ extends to a holomorphic function $F$ on $B$. The uniqueness of $F$ follows from the Identity Theorem, as any two extensions must agree on the dense subset $\\Omega$ of $B$, hence on all of $B$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{F}$",
        "raw_answer": "## Step 1: Understand the Problem Statement\nThe problem asks us to prove that every holomorphic function $f$ defined on the punctured unit ball $\\Omega = B \\setminus \\{0\\}$ in $\\mathbb{C}^n$, where $B = \\{ z \\in \\mathbb{C}^n : \\|z\\| < 1 \\}$ and $n \\ge 2$, can be uniquely extended to a holomorphic function $F$ on the entire unit ball $B$.\n\n## Step 2: Recall Relevant Theorems\nTo tackle this problem, we need to recall relevant theorems about holomorphic functions, particularly those related to extensions and removability of singularities.
