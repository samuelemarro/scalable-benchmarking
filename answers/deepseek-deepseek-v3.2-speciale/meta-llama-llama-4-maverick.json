        "answer": "## Step 1: Understand the Problem and Definitions\nTo prove that there exist two recursively enumerable subsets $A$ and $B$ of $\\mathbb{N}$ that are recursively inseparable, we need to show that $A \\cap B = \\emptyset$ and that there is no recursive set $C \\subseteq \\mathbb{N}$ such that $A \\subseteq C$ and $B \\subseteq \\mathbb{N} \\setminus C$. A set is recursively enumerable if it is the domain of a partial computable function. A set $C$ is recursive if its characteristic function is computable.\n\n## Step 2: Define $A$ and $B$ Using the Admissible Numbering\nLet's define $A = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{N} : \\varphi_x(x) = 0\\}$ and $B = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{N} : \\varphi_x(x) = 1\\}$. Here, $\\varphi_x(x)$ denotes the output of the $x$-th Turing machine on input $x$. $A$ and $B$ are recursively enumerable because we can enumerate them by running all Turing machines on their own indices and checking the outputs. $A \\cap B = \\emptyset$ because $\\varphi_x(x)$ cannot be both $0$ and $1$ simultaneously.\n\n## Step 3: Assume $C$ is Recursive and $A \\subseteq C$, $B \\subseteq \\mathbb{N} \\setminus C$\nAssume there exists a recursive set $C$ such that $A \\subseteq C$ and $B \\subseteq \\mathbb{N} \\setminus C$. The characteristic function of $C$, denoted $\\chi_C$, is computable. This means we can determine for any $x$ whether $x \\in C$ or $x \\notin C$ by computing $\\chi_C(x)$.\n\n## Step 4: Use the Assumption to Derive a Contradiction\nLet's consider the index $e$ of the Turing machine that computes $\\chi_C$. By the definition of $A$ and $B$, if $x \\in A$, then $\\varphi_x(x) = 0$, and if $x \\in B$, then $\\varphi_x(x) = 1$. For $x = e$, if $\\varphi_e(e)$ is defined, it must equal $0$ or $1$. We will use the recursion theorem to show that assuming $C$ exists leads to a contradiction.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the Recursion Theorem\nBy the recursion theorem, there exists an $e$ such that $\\varphi_e(x) = \\chi_C(x)$ for all $x$, or more specifically, we can construct a $\\varphi_e$ such that $\\varphi_e(e) = 1$ if $e \\notin C$ and $\\varphi_e(e) = 0$ if $e \\in C$. However, to directly apply this to our $A$ and $B$, let's directly examine the properties of $e$ such that $\\varphi_e(e)$ halts and equals $0$ or $1$. If $\\varphi_e(e) = 0$, then $e \\in A \\subseteq C$, so $\\chi_C(e) = 1$, but this contradicts the definition of $\\varphi_e(e)$ unless we directly construct $e$ to satisfy a specific condition related to $C$.\n\n## Step 6: Construct $e$ Using the s-m-n Theorem\nUsing the s-m-n theorem, we can find a total computable function $s(e, x)$ such that $\\varphi_{s(e, x)}(y) = \\varphi_e(x, y)$. Let's define $\\varphi_e(x, y) = 1$ if $\\chi_C(x) = 0$ and $\\varphi_e(x, y) = 0$ if $\\chi_C(x) = 1$, for $y = x$. This gives us $\\varphi_{s(e, x)}(x) = \\varphi_e(x, x)$. By the recursion theorem, there exists $x$ such that $\\varphi_x = \\varphi_{s(e, x)}$, implying $\\varphi_x(x) = \\varphi_e(x, x)$.\n\n## Step 7: Derive the Contradiction\nFor $x = e$, if $\\chi_C(e) = 1$, then $\\varphi_e(e, e) = 0$, so $e \\in A$, implying $e \\in C$, which contradicts $\\chi_C(e) = 1$. If $\\chi_C(e) = 0$, then $\\varphi_e(e, e) = 1$, so $e \\in B$, implying $e \\notin C$, which again contradicts $\\chi_C(e) = 0$. This shows that our assumption about $C$ being recursive and separating $A$ and $B$ leads to a contradiction.\n\n## Step 8: Conclusion\nSince assuming the existence of a recursive set $C$ that separates $A$ and $B$ leads to a contradiction, we conclude that $A$ and $B$ are recursively inseparable.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{A = \\{x : \\varphi_x(x) = 0\\}, B = \\{x : \\varphi_x(x) = 1\\}}$",

This means we need to count permutations where all cycles have an even number of elements.\n\n## Step 2: Recognize that a permutation with all cycles of even length can be achieved by considering the properties of cycles and their lengths.\nTo have a cycle of even length, we can think of constructing permutations by combining elements in such a way that they form cycles of even lengths.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the structure of permutations with even-length cycles.\nFor a permutation $\\sigma$ of $\\{1,2,\\dots,2n\\}$ to have all cycles of even length, we can consider how the elements are distributed among these cycles. The total number of elements is $2n$, and they are all part of cycles of even length.\n\n## Step 4: Use the fact that the number of permutations of a set of $n$ elements into cycles of even length can be derived by considering the exponential generating function (EGF) for such permutations.\nThe EGF for permutations with all cycles of even length can be derived by considering the construction of such permutations.\n\n## Step 5: Derive the EGF for permutations with all cycles of even length.\nLet's consider the EGF for the number of permutations of $n$ elements where all cycles are of even length. The EGF for the number of ways to arrange $n$ distinct objects into cycles of even length can be related to the exponential generating function for permutations with certain properties.\n\n## Step 6: Recall that the EGF for permutations with all cycles of even length involves the use of $\\sqrt{\\frac{1+z}{1-z}}$ or related expressions due to the properties of the exponential generating function for such permutations.\nHowever, the direct derivation involves understanding that for a permutation to have all cycles of even length, it must be related to the properties of permutations and their cycle structures.\n\n## Step 7: To count permutations with all cycles of even length, consider the generating function for the number of such permutations.\nThe number of permutations of $2n$ elements into cycles of even length can be related to the coefficient of $x^{2n}$ in the expansion of $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}$, because the exponential generating function for permutations with all cycles of even length involves terms that reflect the structure of even-length cycles.\n\n## Step 8: The exponential generating function (EGF) for permutations with all cycles of even length is given by $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-z^2}}$.\nThis is because the EGF encodes the number of ways to form permutations with cycles of even lengths. The number of such permutations can be derived from the coefficients of the series expansion of $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-z^2}}$.\n\n## Step 9: Compute the coefficient of $\\frac{z^{2n}}{(2n)!}$ in the expansion of $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-z^2}}$ to find the number of permutations of $2n$ elements into cycles of even length.\nThe expansion of $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-z^2}}$ is given by $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{n-\\frac{1}{2}}{n} (-1)^n z^{2n}$, but a more relevant form for our purposes is derived from the series expansion of $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-x}}$ and then substituting $x = z^2$.\n\n## Step 10: Simplify the expression to derive a formula for the number of permutations.\nUsing the property that $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-z^2}} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{2n}{n} \\frac{z^{2n}}{4^n}$, we can derive that the coefficient of $\\frac{z^{2n}}{(2n)!}$ is $(2n)! \\cdot \\frac{\\binom{2n}{n}}{4^n}$.\n\n## Step 11: The number of permutations of $2n$ elements into cycles of even length is given by the coefficient of $\\frac{z^{2n}}{(2n)!}$ in the expansion of $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-z^2}}$.\nThis simplifies to $(2n)! \\cdot \\frac{\\binom{2n}{n}}{4^n}$, but we need to directly count the permutations.\n\n## Step 12: Directly counting the permutations that satisfy the condition involves understanding that the number of such permutations is related to the $(2n)!$ and the properties of binomial coefficients.\nThe number of permutations of $2n$ elements into even cycles can be derived by considering the permutations and their cycle structures.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(2n)! \\cdot \\frac{(2n)!}{2^{2n}(n!)^2}}$ is not the correct interpretation.

        "answer": "## Step 1: Understand the problem statement\nWe need to find all positive integers $n$ such that $n^2$ divides $3^n + 1$. This means $3^n + 1$ must be a multiple of $n^2$, or $\\frac{3^n + 1}{n^2}$ is an integer.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the divisibility condition\nTo start, we examine the condition $n^2 \\mid 3^n + 1$. This implies that $n$ must be odd because if $n$ were even, $3^n + 1$ would be even but not necessarily divisible by $4$, and for $n = 2k$, $n^2 = 4k^2$, so $3^{2k} + 1$ needs to be divisible by $4$, which is not generally true for all $k$ since $3^{2k} \\mod 4$ can be $1$, making $3^{2k} + 1 \\mod 4 = 2$, not $0$.\n\n## Step 3: Check for $n = 1$\nFor $n = 1$, $n^2 = 1$, and $3^n + 1 = 3^1 + 1 = 4$. Since $4$ is divisible by $1$, $n = 1$ is a solution.\n\n## Step 4: Explore the condition for odd $n$\nFor odd $n$, we need to check if there's a pattern or a method to simplify $3^n + 1$ to see if it's divisible by $n^2$. Let's consider using modular arithmetic to simplify the problem.\n\n## Step 5: Apply modular arithmetic\nUsing modular arithmetic, we want $3^n \\equiv -1 \\mod n^2$. For $n = 1$, this is trivially true. For larger odd $n$, we need to investigate further.\n\n## Step 6: Investigate $n = 3$ and $n = 5$ as potential small odd $n$ values\nFor $n = 3$, $3^3 + 1 = 28$, and $28$ is not divisible by $9$, so $n = 3$ is not a solution. For $n = 5$, $3^5 + 1 = 244$, and $244$ is not divisible by $25$, so $n = 5$ is not a solution.\n\n## Step 7: Consider the case for larger odd $n$\nLet's examine if there's a larger odd $n$ that satisfies the condition. We need $3^n \\equiv -1 \\mod n^2$. This can be related to the order of $3$ modulo $n^2$. The order of $3$ mod $n^2$ must divide $2n$ because $3^{2n} \\equiv (3^n)^2 \\equiv (-1)^2 \\equiv 1 \\mod n^2$ if $3^n \\equiv -1 \\mod n^2$.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze the order of $3$ modulo $n$\nFor odd prime $p$, if $p$ divides $n$, then the order of $3$ modulo $p$ divides the order of $3$ modulo $n^2$. If $3^n \\equiv -1 \\mod n^2$, then the order of $3$ modulo $n^2$ is $2n$, implying that $2n$ is the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $3^k \\equiv 1 \\mod n^2$.\n\n## Step 9: Investigate the condition using Euler's theorem\nEuler's theorem states that $a^{\\phi(m)} \\equiv 1 \\mod m$ if $\\gcd(a, m) = 1$, where $\\phi(m)$ is Euler's totient function. For $m = n^2$, $\\phi(n^2) = n^2 - n$ if $n$ is prime, but for composite $n$, $\\phi(n^2)$ is more complex. However, we know $\\phi(n^2) = n\\phi(n)$.\n\n## Step 10: Simplify the problem by checking specific values and patterns\nLet's directly check some small odd values of $n$ and consider patterns or properties that might help. Notably, for $n = 1$, we have a solution. Checking larger $n$ directly is cumbersome, so let's consider properties of numbers that might satisfy $n^2 \\mid 3^n + 1$.\n\n## Step 11: Consider $n$ being a prime\nIf $n$ is an odd prime, then for $3^n \\equiv -1 \\mod n$, it must satisfy $3^{2n} \\equiv 1 \\mod n$, which is true by Fermat's Little Theorem. However, we need $3^n \\equiv -1 \\mod n^2$, which is a stronger condition.\n\n## Step 12: Analyze the condition for $n = p$, an odd prime\nFor an odd prime $p$, if $3^p \\equiv -1 \\mod p$, then $3^p \\equiv -1 \\mod p^2$ is a stronger condition. Let's check if there are any odd primes $p$ where $3^p \\equiv -1 \\mod p^2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",
