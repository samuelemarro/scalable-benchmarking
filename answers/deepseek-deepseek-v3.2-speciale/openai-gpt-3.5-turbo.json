        "answer": "**Solution:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the disjoint cycle decomposition of permutations. A permutation can be decomposed into cycles, where each cycle represents a group of elements that are permuted cyclically.\n\nFor a cycle to have even length, it must consist of 2, 4, 6, ... elements. Let's analyze the possible cycle lengths for the elements $\\{1,2,\\dots,2n\\}$:\n\n1. For a cycle of length 2, there are $\\binom{2n}{2}$ ways to choose two elements and $\\frac{1}{2}$ ways to arrange them in a cycle.\n2. For a cycle of length 4, there are $\\binom{2n}{4}$ ways to choose four elements and $\\frac{1}{4}$ ways to arrange them in a cycle.\n3. Similarly, for a cycle of length 6, there are $\\binom{2n}{6}$ ways to choose six elements and $\\frac{1}{6}$ ways to arrange them in a cycle.\n4. Continuing this pattern, for a cycle of length $2k$, there are $\\binom{2n}{2k}$ ways to choose $2k$ elements and $\\frac{1}{2k}$ ways to arrange them in a cycle.\n\nSince each cycle in the permutation must have an even length, the total number of permutations will be the product of the number of ways to form cycles of each length.\n\nTherefore, the total number of permutations with all cycles of even length is:\n\n$$\n\\binom{2n}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\binom{2n}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\binom{2n}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} \\cdots = \\prod_{k=1}^{n} \\binom{2n}{2k} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2k}\n$$\n\nThis product can be simplified using the double factorial notation:\n\n$$\n\\prod_{k=1}^{n} \\binom{2n}{2k} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2k} = \\frac{(2n)!}{2^n \\cdot n!}\n$$\n\nTherefore, the closed-form expression for the number of permutations $\\sigma$ of the set $\\{1,2,\\dots,2n\\}$ such that every cycle in the disjoint cycle decomposition of $\\sigma$ has even length is $\\boxed{\\frac{(2n)!}{2^n \\cdot n!}}$.",

        "answer": "To find all positive integers $n$ satisfying $n^2 \\mid 3^n + 1$, we can start by considering the possible values of $n$.\n\nLet's denote $n^2$ as $m$ for simplicity. So, we have $m \\mid 3^n + 1$.\n\nFirst, note that $m$ must be odd since $3^n + 1$ is always even for any integer $n$. This implies that $m$ is a perfect square of an odd number.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values of $n$ based on the modulo properties of powers of $3$.\n\n1. For $n = 1$: $3^1 + 1 = 4$, which is divisible by $m = 2^2$. So, $n = 1$ is a valid solution.\n\n2. For $n = 2$: $3^2 + 1 = 10$, which is not divisible by $m = 2^2$. So, $n = 2$ is not a solution.\n\n3. For $n = 3$: $3^3 + 1 = 28$, which is not divisible by $m = 3^2$. So, $n = 3$ is not a solution.\n\n4. For $n = 4$: $3^4 + 1 = 82$, which is not divisible by $m = 4^2$. So, $n = 4$ is not a solution.\n\n5. For $n = 5$: $3^5 + 1 = 244$, which is divisible by $m = 4^2$. So, $n = 5$ is a valid solution.\n\nFrom the analysis above, we can see that the only positive integers $n$ satisfying $n^2 \\mid 3^n + 1$ are $n = 1$ and $n = 5$.\n\nTherefore, the solutions are $n = 1$ and $n = 5$.",
