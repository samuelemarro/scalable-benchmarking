A function is partial if it is not defined for all inputs, and total if it is defined for every input.\n\n2. **Recursively Enumerable (r.e.) Sets**: A set $A \\subseteq \\mathbb{N}$ is recursively enumerable if there is a Turing machine that enumerates the elements of $A$.

The Halting Problem is the set:\n   $$ \\mathrm{HALT} = \\{ (e, n) \\mid \\varphi_e(n) \\text{ halts} \\}. $$\n\n3. **Using $T$ to Solve the Halting Problem**:\n   - Given an input $(e, n)$, we want to determine if $\\varphi_e(n)$ halts.\n   - Construct a new Turing machine $M$ that works as follows:\n     - On input $x$, $M$ simulates $\\varphi_e(n)$.\n     - If $\\varphi_e(n)$ halts, $M$ enters an infinite loop.\n     - If $\\varphi_e(n)$ does not halt, $M$ halts immediately.\n   - Note that $M$ is total if and only if $\\varphi_e(n)$ does not halt.\n\n4. **Check Totality with $T$**:\n   - Use the machine $T$ to check if the index of $M$ (let's call it $m$) is in $\\mathrm{Tot}$.\n   - If $m \\in \\mathrm{Tot}$, then $\\varphi_e(n)$ does not halt.\n   - If $m \\notin \\mathrm{Tot}$, then $\\varphi_e(n)$ halts.\n\n5. **Contradiction**: If $T$ exists, we can decide the Halting Problem, which is a contradiction because the Halting Problem is undecidable.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince assuming $\\mathrm{Tot}$ is recursively enumerable leads to a contradiction, we conclude that $\\mathrm{Tot}$ is not recursively enumerable.
