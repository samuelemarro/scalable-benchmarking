Then there exists a Turing machine $M$ that enumerates $\\mathrm{Tot}$.\n\n2. **Construct a New Function**: Define a function $f$ as follows:\n   - For each $e \\in \\mathbb{N}$, simulate the Turing machine $M$ on input $e$.\n   - If $e \\in \\mathrm{Tot}$ (i.e., $M$ eventually enumerates $e$), then $f(e) = 0$.\n   - If $e \\notin \\mathrm{Tot}$, then $f(e)$ is undefined (i.e., $f$ is a partial function).\n\n3. **Diagonalization Argument**: Consider the function $g$ defined by:\n   - $g(e) = \\varphi_e(e) + 1$ if $\\varphi_e(e)$ is defined.\n   - $g(e)$ is undefined if $\\varphi_e(e)$ is undefined.\n\n   The function $g$ is not total because for any $e$, if $\\varphi_e(e)$ is undefined, then $g(e)$ is also undefined.\n\n4. **Contradiction**: If $\\mathrm{Tot}$ were recursively enumerable, then $g$ would be total for some $e \\in \\mathrm{Tot}$, contradicting the definition of $g$.

Therefore, $\\mathrm{Tot}$ is not recursively enumerable.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe set $\\mathrm{Tot}$, the set of indices of total recursive functions, is not recursively enumerable.

We will address each part of the problem step by step.\n\n### Part (a): Lifting $\\varphi$ to a Morphism $\\Phi: X \\to \\mathbb{P}^2$\n\nThe map $\\varphi$ is not defined at the points $P_1$, $P_2$, and $P_3$ because at these points, at least one of the coordinates in the image $(yz : xz : xy)$ becomes $(0:0:0)$, which is not a valid point in projective space. The blow-up $X$ resolves these indeterminacies by replacing each point $P_i$ with an exceptional divisor $E_i$.\n\nTo show that $\\varphi$ lifts to a morphism $\\Phi: X \\to \\mathbb{P}^2$, we need to check that the indeterminacies of $\\varphi$ are resolved on $X$. The blow-up $X$ introduces local coordinates around each $P_i$ that allow us to extend $\\varphi$ to a well-defined morphism.\n\n- Near $P_1 = (1:0:0)$, we use local coordinates $(u, v)$ such that $(x:y:z) = (1: u: v)$. Then $\\varphi(1:u:v) = (v: v: u)$, which is well-defined except at $v = 0$. However, in the blow-up, $v = 0$ corresponds to a point on the exceptional divisor $E_1$, and the map is well-defined there.\n\n- Similarly, near $P_2 = (0:1:0)$, we use local coordinates $(u, v)$ such that $(x:y:z) = (u:1:v)$. Then $\\varphi(u:1:v) = (v: uv: u)$, which is well-defined except at $u = 0$. Again, this corresponds to a point on the exceptional divisor $E_2$.\n\n- Near $P_3 = (0:0:1)$, we use local coordinates $(u, v)$ such that $(x:y:z) = (u:v:1)$. Then $\\varphi(u:v:1) = (1: u: v)$, which is well-defined except at $u = 0$ or $v = 0$, corresponding to points on the exceptional divisor $E_3$.\n\nThus, the map $\\varphi$ lifts to a morphism $\\Phi: X \\to \\mathbb{P}^2$.\n\n### Part (b): Computing the Class of $\\Phi^* \\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{P}^2}(1)$ in $\\operatorname{Pic}(X)$\n\nThe pullback of the hyperplane class $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{P}^2}(1)$ under $\\Phi$ is given by the divisor class $\\Phi^* \\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{P}^2}(1)$ on $X$. We express this class in terms of $H$, $E_1$, $E_2$, and $E_3$.\n\nThe map $\\varphi(x:y:z) = (yz : xz : xy)$ is homogeneous of degree 2, meaning that the preimage of a hyperplane in $\\mathbb{P}^2$ under $\\varphi$ is a degree 2 curve in $\\mathbb{P}^2$.

A loop is a continuous map $\\gamma: [0, 1] \\to G$ such that $\\gamma(0) = \\gamma(1) = e$.

At $t = 1$, $H(s, 1) = \\alpha(s) \\beta(1) \\alpha(s)^{-1} \\beta(1)^{-1} = e$. Thus, $H(s, 0) = H(s, 1) = e$ for all $s \\in [0, 1]$.\n\nNow, consider the path $K: [0, 1] \\to G$ defined by $K(t) = \\alpha(t) \\beta(t) \\alpha(t)^{-1} \\beta(t)^{-1}$.

Two loops $\\gamma$ and $\\delta$ are homotopic (denoted $\\gamma \\sim \\delta$) if there exists a continuous map $H: [0, 1] \\times [0, 1] \\to G$ such that $H(s, 0) = \\gamma(s)$, $H(s, 1) = \\delta(s)$, and $H(0, t) = H(1, t) = e$ for all $s, t \\in [0, 1]$.\n\n### Step 2: Use the Group Structure\n\nThe group operation in $G$ induces an operation on loops. Given two loops $\\alpha, \\beta: [0, 1] \\to G$ based at $e$, we can define their product $\\alpha \\cdot \\beta$ as the loop given by:\n\\[\n(\\alpha \\cdot \\beta)(t) = \\begin{cases} \n\\alpha(2t) & \\text{if } 0 \\leq t \\leq \\frac{1}{2}, \\\\\n\\beta(2t - 1) & \\text{if } \\frac{1}{2} < t \\leq 1.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nThis operation is associative up to homotopy and has the constant loop at $e$ as the identity element.\n\n### Step 3: Show Commutativity\n\nTo show that $\\pi_1(G, e)$ is abelian, we need to show that for any two loops $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ based at $e$, the loops $\\alpha \\cdot \\beta$ and $\\beta \\cdot \\alpha$ are homotopic.\n\nConsider the homotopy $H: [0, 1] \\times [0, 1] \\to G$ defined by:\n\\[\nH(s, t) = \\alpha(s) \\beta(t) \\alpha(s)^{-1} \\beta(t)^{-1}.\n\\]\nAt $t = 0$, $H(s, 0) = \\alpha(s) e \\alpha(s)^{-1} e^{-1} = e$. At $t = 1$, $H(s, 1) = \\alpha(s) \\beta(1) \\alpha(s)^{-1} \\beta(1)^{-1} = e$. Thus, $H(s, 0) = H(s, 1) = e$ for all $s \\in [0, 1]$.\n\nNow, consider the path $K: [0, 1] \\to G$ defined by $K(t) = \\alpha(t) \\beta(t) \\alpha(t)^{-1} \\beta(t)^{-1}$. This path is constant at $e$, since for each $t$, $K(t) = e$. Therefore, the loops $\\alpha \\cdot \\beta$ and $\\beta \\cdot \\alpha$ are homotopic via the homotopy $H$, which shows that $\\pi_1(G, e)$ is abelian.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe fundamental group $\\pi_1(G, e)$ of a connected topological group $G$ is abelian. This is because the group operation in $G$ allows us to construct a homotopy between any two loops $\\alpha \\cdot \\beta$ and $\\beta \\cdot \\alpha$, demonstrating that the operation on the fundamental group is commutative.",

        "answer": "To evaluate the improper integral\n\n$$\nI = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(\\ln x)^2}{x^2+1} \\, dx,\n$$\n\nwe will use a substitution and symmetry arguments. \n\n### Step 1: Substitution\n\nFirst, consider the substitution $x = \\frac{1}{t}$, which implies $dx = -\\frac{1}{t^2} \\, dt$. The limits of integration change as follows: when $x = 0$, $t \\to \\infty$; and when $x \\to \\infty$, $t = 0$. Thus, the integral becomes:\n\n$$\nI = \\int_{\\infty}^{0} \\frac{(\\ln \\frac{1}{t})^2}{\\left(\\frac{1}{t}\\right)^2 + 1} \\left(-\\frac{1}{t^2}\\right) \\, dt.\n$$\n\nSimplifying the integrand, we have:\n\n- $\\ln \\frac{1}{t} = -\\ln t$,\n- $\\left(\\frac{1}{t}\\right)^2 + 1 = \\frac{1}{t^2} + 1 = \\frac{1 + t^2}{t^2}$.\n\nThus, the integrand becomes:\n\n$$\n\\frac{(-\\ln t)^2}{\\frac{1 + t^2}{t^2}} \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{1}{t^2}\\right) = \\frac{(\\ln t)^2 t^2}{1 + t^2} \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{1}{t^2}\\right) = -\\frac{(\\ln t)^2}{1 + t^2}.\n$$\n\nTherefore, the integral becomes:\n\n$$\nI = \\int_{\\infty}^{0} -\\frac{(\\ln t)^2}{1 + t^2} \\, dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(\\ln t)^2}{1 + t^2} \\, dt.\n$$\n\nNotice that this is the same as the original integral $I$. Thus, we have:\n\n$$\nI = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(\\ln x)^2}{x^2+1} \\, dx = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(\\ln t)^2}{1 + t^2} \\, dt.\n$$\n\n### Step 2: Symmetry Argument\n\nThe integral is symmetric under the transformation $x \\to \\frac{1}{x}$, which implies that the integral is invariant under this substitution. This symmetry suggests that the integral can be split into two equal parts, each contributing half of the total value.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluation\n\nTo evaluate the integral, we can use the symmetry and properties of definite integrals. Consider the function $f(x) = \\frac{(\\ln x)^2}{x^2 + 1}$.

The fundamental group of the torus is $\\pi_1(T) = \\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}$, generated by loops corresponding to the two identifications.\n\n2. **Punctured Torus $T_0$**: The punctured torus $T_0$ is obtained by removing the interior of a disk $D$ from $T$. Topologically, $T_0$ is a torus with a hole, which is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of two circles (a figure-eight), so $\\pi_1(T_0) = \\langle a, b \\mid \\rangle$, a free group on two generators.\n\n3. **M\u00f6bius Strip $M$**: The M\u00f6bius strip $M$ is the quotient of $[0,1] \\times [0,1]$ by $(0,y) \\sim (1,1-y)$. Its boundary $\\partial M$ is a circle. The fundamental group of the M\u00f6bius strip is $\\pi_1(M) = \\mathbb{Z}$, generated by a loop that goes around the strip once.\n\n### Step 2: Gluing the Spaces\n\nWe form $X = T_0 \\cup_h M$ by gluing the boundary of the M\u00f6bius strip $\\partial M$ to the boundary of the disk $D$ in $T_0$. The boundary of $D$ is a circle, and the boundary of $M$ is also a circle, so $h: \\partial M \\to \\partial D$ is a homeomorphism between circles.\n\n### Step 3: Apply Seifert-van Kampen Theorem\n\nThe Seifert-van Kampen theorem allows us to compute the fundamental group of a space formed by gluing two spaces along a common boundary. We have:\n\n- $A = T_0$, with $\\pi_1(A) = \\langle a, b \\mid \\rangle$.\n- $B = M$, with $\\pi_1(B) = \\langle c \\mid c^2 = 1 \\rangle$ (since the M\u00f6bius strip has a fundamental group of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, generated by a loop that goes around the strip twice).\n- $A \\cap B = \\partial D \\cong S^1$, with $\\pi_1(A \\cap B) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe inclusion maps induce homomorphisms:\n- $i_*: \\pi_1(A \\cap B) \\to \\pi_1(A)$, which maps the generator of $\\pi_1(A \\cap B)$ to a word in $a$ and $b$.\n- $j_*: \\pi_1(A \\cap B) \\to \\pi_1(B)$, which maps the generator of $\\pi_1(A \\cap B)$ to $c$.\n\nBy Seifert-van Kampen, $\\pi_1(X)$ is the free product of $\\pi_1(A)$ and $\\pi_1(B)$ amalgamated over $\\pi_1(A \\cap B)$:\n$$ \\pi_1(X) = \\langle a, b, c \\mid c^2 = 1, i_*(g) = j_*(g) \\rangle, $$\nwhere $g$ is the generator of $\\pi_1(A \\cap B)$.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Relations\n\nThe relation $i_*(g) = j_*(g)$ means that the loop in $A \\cap B$ is identified with the loop in $B$. Since $j_*(g) = c$, we have $i_*(g) = c$ in $\\pi_1(A)$. This means that the loop around the boundary of the disk $D$ in $T_0$ is identified with the loop $c$ in $M$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe fundamental group $\\pi_1(X)$ is given by:\n$$ \\pi_1(X) = \\langle a, b, c \\mid c^2 = 1, \\text{(boundary loop relation)} \\rangle. $$\n\nThe boundary loop relation depends on how the boundary of $D$ is represented in terms of $a$ and $b$.

Thus, $H^0_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^n) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$, and $H^1_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^n) = 0$.\n\n- For $1 \\leq k \\leq n-2$, the sequence is:\n  $$\n  0 \\to H^k_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^n) \\to 0 \\oplus 0 \\to 0 \\to H^{k+1}_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^n) \\to 0.\n  $$\n  Therefore, $H^k_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^n) = 0$ for $1 \\leq k \\leq n-2$.\n\n- For $k = n-1$, the sequence is:\n  $$\n  0 \\to H^{n-1}_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^n) \\to 0 \\oplus 0 \\to \\mathbb{R} \\to H^n_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^n) \\to 0.\n  $$\n  The map $\\mathbb{R} \\to H^n_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^n)$ is an isomorphism, so $H^n_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^n) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$ and $H^{n-1}_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^n) = 0$.\n\n- For $k = n$, the sequence is:\n  $$\n  0 \\to H^n_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^n) \\to 0 \\oplus 0 \\to 0 \\to H^{n+1}_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^n) \\to 0.\n  $$\n  Therefore, $H^{n+1}_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^n) = 0$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe de Rham cohomology groups of the sphere $S^n$ are:\n- $H^0_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^n) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$,\n- $H^n_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^n) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$,\n- $H^k_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^n) = 0$ for all other $k$.\n\nThus, the de Rham cohomology groups of $S^n$ are as follows:\n$$\nH^k_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^n) \\cong \\begin{cases} \n\\mathbb{R}, & \\text{if } k = 0 \\text{ or } k = n, \\\\\n0, & \\text{otherwise.}\n\\end{cases}\n$$",
