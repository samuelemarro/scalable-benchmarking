A function is partial if it is not defined for all inputs, and total if it is defined for every input.\n\n2. **Recursively Enumerable (r.e.) Sets**: A set $A \\subseteq \\mathbb{N}$ is recursively enumerable if there is a Turing machine that enumerates the elements of $A$.

The Halting Problem is the set:\n   $$ \\mathrm{HALT} = \\{ (e, n) \\mid \\varphi_e(n) \\text{ halts} \\}. $$\n\n3. **Using $T$ to Solve the Halting Problem**:\n   - Given an input $(e, n)$, we want to determine if $\\varphi_e(n)$ halts.\n   - Construct a new Turing machine $M$ that works as follows:\n     - On input $x$, $M$ simulates $\\varphi_e(n)$.\n     - If $\\varphi_e(n)$ halts, $M$ enters an infinite loop.\n     - If $\\varphi_e(n)$ does not halt, $M$ halts immediately.\n   - Note that $M$ is total if and only if $\\varphi_e(n)$ does not halt.\n\n4. **Check Totality with $T$**:\n   - Use the machine $T$ to check if the index of $M$ (let's call it $m$) is in $\\mathrm{Tot}$.\n   - If $m \\in \\mathrm{Tot}$, then $\\varphi_e(n)$ does not halt.\n   - If $m \\notin \\mathrm{Tot}$, then $\\varphi_e(n)$ halts.\n\n5. **Contradiction**: If $T$ exists, we can decide the Halting Problem, which is a contradiction because the Halting Problem is undecidable.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince assuming $\\mathrm{Tot}$ is recursively enumerable leads to a contradiction, we conclude that $\\mathrm{Tot}$ is not recursively enumerable.

By definition, $j \\leq a \\vee b$. Since $j$ is join-irreducible, if $j = x \\vee y$, then $j = x$ or $j = y$. Therefore, $j \\leq a$ or $j \\leq b$. Thus, $j \\in \\varphi(a)$ or $j \\in \\varphi(b)$, which implies $j \\in \\varphi(a) \\cup \\varphi(b)$.\n\n- Conversely, if $j \\in \\varphi(a) \\cup \\varphi(b)$, then $j \\leq a$ or $j \\leq b$. Hence, $j \\leq a \\vee b$, so $j \\in \\varphi(a \\vee b)$.\n\nThus, $\\varphi(a \\vee b) = \\varphi(a) \\cup \\varphi(b)$.\n\n**Meet Preservation:**\n\nWe need to show that $\\varphi(a \\wedge b) = \\varphi(a) \\cap \\varphi(b)$ for all $a, b \\in L$.\n\n- Consider $j \\in \\varphi(a \\wedge b)$. By definition, $j \\leq a \\wedge b$. This implies $j \\leq a$ and $j \\leq b$, so $j \\in \\varphi(a)$ and $j \\in \\varphi(b)$. Therefore, $j \\in \\varphi(a) \\cap \\varphi(b)$.\n\n- Conversely, if $j \\in \\varphi(a) \\cap \\varphi(b)$, then $j \\leq a$ and $j \\leq b$. Hence, $j \\leq a \\wedge b$, so $j \\in \\varphi(a \\wedge b)$.\n\nThus, $\\varphi(a \\wedge b) = \\varphi(a) \\cap \\varphi(b)$.\n\n### Step 2: Show that $\\varphi$ is bijective\n\n**Injectivity:**\n\nAssume $\\varphi(a) = \\varphi(b)$ for $a, b \\in L$. We need to show $a = b$.\n\n- Since $\\varphi(a) = \\varphi(b)$, for every join-irreducible $j \\leq a$, we have $j \\leq b$, and vice versa. In a finite distributive lattice, every element is the join of join-irreducibles below it.

We need to find $a \\in L$ such that $\\varphi(a) = I$.\n\n- Define $a = \\bigvee I$. Since $I$ is an order ideal, for any $j \\in I$, $j \\leq a$.
