        "answer": "To prove the existence of two recursively enumerable (r.e.) subsets $A$ and $B$ of the natural numbers $\\mathbb{N}$ that are recursively inseparable, we need to construct such sets $A$ and $B$ with the properties:\n\n1. $A \\cap B = \\emptyset$.\n2. There is no recursive set $C \\subseteq \\mathbb{N}$ such that $A \\subseteq C$ and $B \\subseteq \\mathbb{N} \\setminus C$.\n\n### Construction of $A$ and $B$\n\nWe will use the concept of the halting problem to construct these sets. Let $K$ be the halting set, defined as:\n\n$$\nK = \\{ \\langle e, x \\rangle \\mid \\varphi_e(x) \\text{ is defined} \\}\n$$\n\nThe set $K$ is known to be recursively enumerable but not recursive.\n\nDefine the sets $A$ and $B$ as follows:\n\n- $A = \\{ x \\mid \\exists y \\, (\\langle x, y \\rangle \\in K) \\}$\n- $B = \\{ x \\mid \\forall y \\, (\\langle x, y \\rangle \\notin K) \\}$\n\n### Verification of Properties\n\n1. **Disjointness**: By definition, $A \\cap B = \\emptyset$. If $x \\in A$, then there exists some $y$ such that $\\langle x, y \\rangle \\in K$, meaning $\\varphi_x(y)$ halts. Conversely, if $x \\in B$, then for all $y$, $\\langle x, y \\rangle \\notin K$, meaning $\\varphi_x(y)$ does not halt for any $y$. Thus, no $x$ can be in both $A$ and $B$.\n\n2. **Recursive Inseparability**: Assume for contradiction that there exists a recursive set $C$ such that $A \\subseteq C$ and $B \\subseteq \\mathbb{N} \\setminus C$. This would imply that $C$ can decide membership in $A$ and $B$, effectively deciding whether there exists a $y$ such that $\\langle x, y \\rangle \\in K$. This would mean we can decide the halting problem, which is impossible since $K$ is not recursive. Therefore, no such recursive set $C$ can exist.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe sets $A$ and $B$ are recursively enumerable (since $K$ is recursively enumerable and $A$ and $B$ are defined in terms of $K$), disjoint, and recursively inseparable. Thus, we have constructed the desired sets $A$ and $B$.\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\text{There exist recursively enumerable sets } A \\text{ and } B \\text{ that are recursively inseparable.}}\n$$",

This means that $n^2$ divides $3^n + 1$, or equivalently, $3^n + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n^2}$.\n\nLet's start by testing small values of $n$:\n\n1. **$n = 1$:**\n   $$\n   3^1 + 1 = 4\n   $$\n   Since $1^2 = 1$ and $4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{1}$, $n = 1$ is a solution.\n\n2. **$n = 2$:**\n   $$\n   3^2 + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10\n   $$\n   Since $2^2 = 4$ and $10 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$, $n = 2$ is not a solution.\n\n3. **$n = 3$:**\n   $$\n   3^3 + 1 = 27 + 1 = 28\n   $$\n   Since $3^2 = 9$ and $28 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}$, $n = 3$ is not a solution.\n\n4. **$n = 4$:**\n   $$\n   3^4 + 1 = 81 + 1 = 82\n   $$\n   Since $4^2 = 16$ and $82 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{16}$, $n = 4$ is not a solution.\n\n5. **$n = 5$:**\n   $$\n   3^5 + 1 = 243 + 1 = 244\n   $$\n   Since $5^2 = 25$ and $244 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{25}$, $n = 5$ is not a solution.\n\nNow, let's consider a general approach. We need $3^n \\equiv -1 \\pmod{n^2}$. This implies that $3^{2n} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n^2}$ because squaring both sides of $3^n \\equiv -1 \\pmod{n^2}$ gives $3^{2n} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n^2}$.\n\nBy Fermat's Little Theorem, if $n$ is a prime, $3^{n-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}$.
