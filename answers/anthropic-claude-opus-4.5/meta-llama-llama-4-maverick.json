        "answer": "## Step 1: Understand the problem statement\nThe problem asks us to address three parts related to a nonstandard model $\\mathcal{M}$ of Peano Arithmetic (PA). First, we need to prove the Overspill Lemma, which states that if a formula $\\phi(x, \\vec{y})$ holds for all standard natural numbers $n$, then there exists a nonstandard $c$ such that $\\phi(c, \\vec{b})$ holds. Second, we are to prove that every nonstandard model $\\mathcal{M}$ of PA contains a nonstandard element $a$ such that $2^a$ exists and is greater than any standard $n$. Lastly, we need to show that $\\text{Pr}(p)$ is satisfied for infinitely many nonstandard $p$, where $\\text{Pr}(x)$ denotes \"$x$ is prime\".\n\n## Step 2: Prove the Overspill Lemma for part (a)\nTo prove the Overspill Lemma, let's assume $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\text{PA}$ and $\\phi(x, \\vec{y})$ is a formula such that $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\phi(n, \\vec{b})$ for all standard $n$. We need to show that there exists a nonstandard $c$ such that $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\phi(c, \\vec{b})$. The Overspill Lemma is essentially about showing that if $\\phi(n, \\vec{y})$ holds for all standard $n$, then it holds for some nonstandard $n$ as well.\n\n## Step 3: Address part (a) - Overspill Lemma\nLet $\\psi(x)$ be the formula $\\forall y (y < x \\rightarrow \\neg \\phi(y, \\vec{b}))$. If $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\psi(c)$ for some $c$, then $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\neg\\phi(d)$ for all $d < c$. For any standard $n$, $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\phi(n, \\vec{b})$, so $c > n$ for all standard $n$. Thus, $c$ is nonstandard, and $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\phi(c, \\vec{b})$ because $\\phi(x, \\vec{y})$ is satisfied for all standard $x$. However, the task is to directly address the given problem parts.\n\n## Step 4: Solve part (b) of the problem\nFor part (b), we need to prove that every nonstandard model $\\mathcal{M}$ of PA contains a nonstandard element $a$ such that $\\mathcal{M} \\models 2^a$ exists and $\\mathcal{M} \\models 2^a > n$ for all standard $n$. Since $\\mathcal{M}$ is nonstandard, there exists a nonstandard element $a$ such that $\\mathcal{M} \\models a > n$ for all standard $n$. We can consider $2^a$, and because $2^a$ is defined in $\\mathcal{M}$, it follows that $\\mathcal{M} \\models 2^a > 2^n$ for any standard $n$, implying $2^a > n$ for any standard $n$.\n\n## Step 5: Address part (c) of the problem\nFor part (c), we are to show that every nonstandard model $\\mathcal{M}$ contains infinitely many nonstandard primes. Assume there are only finitely many nonstandard primes $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_k$. Consider $p = p_1 \\cdot p_2 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot p_k + 1$. $p$ is not divisible by any of $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_k$, so it is either prime or has a prime factor not among $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_k$. This leads to a contradiction if $p$ is assumed to be composite with a factor not among the $p_i$, as it would imply the existence of a prime not in the list, or if $p$ is prime, it's a new prime not in the list.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

        "answer": "## Step 1: Understanding the Overspill Lemma\nThe Overspill Lemma is a fundamental property of nonstandard models of Peano Arithmetic. It states that if a formula $\\phi(x, \\vec{y})$ is true for all standard natural numbers $n$, then there exists a nonstandard natural number $c$ for which $\\phi(c, \\vec{y})$ is true. To prove this, we consider the formula $\\forall x (\\phi(x, \\vec{y}) \\rightarrow \\phi(S(x), \\vec{y}))$ and the fact that $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\text{PA}$.\n\n## Step 2: Proving the Overspill Lemma\nLet's prove the Overspill Lemma. Assume $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\phi(\\underline{n}, \\vec{b})$ for all standard $n$. Consider the formula $\\psi(x, \\vec{y}) = \\forall z \\leq x \\phi(z, \\vec{y})$. For any standard $n$, $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\psi(\\underline{n}, \\vec{b})$ because $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\phi(\\underline{m}, \\vec{b})$ for all $m \\leq n$. By the induction axiom in PA, $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\forall x \\psi(x, \\vec{b})$. This implies that for any $c \\in M$, $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\psi(c, \\vec{b})$. Since $\\mathcal{M}$ is nonstandard, there exists a nonstandard $c$ such that $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\psi(c, \\vec{b})$, and thus $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\phi(c, \\vec{b})$ because $c$ is an upper bound for all standard numbers, and $\\phi$ holds for all numbers less than or equal to $c$, including nonstandard ones just above the standard numbers.\n\n## Step 3: Applying the Overspill Lemma to Part (b)\nFor part (b), we need to show that there exists a nonstandard $a$ such that $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\text{\"}2^a \\text{ exists\"}$ and $2^a > \\underline{n}$ for all standard $n$. Consider the formula $\\phi(x) = \\exists y (y = 2^x)$. For any standard $n$, $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\phi(\\underline{n})$ because $2^n$ is defined in $\\mathcal{M}$. By the Overspill Lemma, there exists a nonstandard $a$ such that $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\phi(a)$, meaning $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\text{\"}2^a \\text{ exists\"}$. Furthermore, for any standard $n$, the formula $\\psi(x) = 2^x > \\underline{n}$ is true for all standard $x$ greater than some $m$ (since $2^x$ grows beyond any standard $n$ as $x$ increases). Applying the Overspill Lemma to $\\psi(x)$ gives a nonstandard $a$ such that $2^a > \\underline{n}$ for any standard $n$.\n\n## Step 4: Proving Part (c) - Infinitely Many Nonstandard Primes\nFor part (c), we aim to prove that there are infinitely many nonstandard primes. Assume, for contradiction, that there are only finitely many nonstandard primes, say $p_1, p_2, ..., p_k$. Consider the formula $\\text{Pr}(x)$ expressing \"$x$ is prime\". For any standard prime $p$, $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\text{Pr}(p)$. The Overspill Lemma implies there exists a nonstandard prime $p$. Now, consider the product $N = p_1 \\cdot p_2 \\cdot ... \\cdot p_k + 1$. $N$ is not divisible by any of $p_1, ..., p_k$, and by construction, it is not standard. If $N$ is prime, it contradicts the assumption that $p_1, ..., p_k$ are all the nonstandard primes. If $N$ is not prime, it has a prime divisor $q$. $q$ cannot be standard because $N$ is not divisible by any standard prime, and $q$ cannot be one of $p_1, ..., p_k$ because $N$ is constructed to be one more than a multiple of each $p_i$. Thus, $q$ is a nonstandard prime not in the list $p_1, ..., p_k$, a contradiction.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

This means for any point $(a, b)$ on the path, $b \\geq a - 1$ must hold. The paths can only be composed of right steps $(+1, 0)$ and up steps $(0, +1)$.\n\n## Step 2: Recognize that the problem is related to Catalan numbers or a similar combinatorial concept.\nThe condition $b \\geq a - 1$ is similar to but slightly different from the condition for Catalan numbers, which require $b \\geq a$. We need to adjust our understanding to fit the given condition.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the condition $b \\geq a - 1$ and its implications.\nFor a path to be admissible, it must satisfy $b \\geq a - 1$ at every step. This implies that the path can go below the line $y = x$ by at most one unit. We can relate this to the concept of ballot numbers or use a reflection principle to count the paths.\n\n## Step 4: Use the reflection principle or a similar method to count admissible paths.\nTo count paths that satisfy $b \\geq a - 1$, we can consider the total number of paths from $(0,0)$ to $(n,n)$ and then subtract the paths that violate this condition. The total number of paths is given by $\\binom{2n}{n}$ since there are $2n$ steps in total and $n$ of them are up steps.\n\n## Step 5: Identify paths that violate the condition $b \\geq a - 1$.\nA path violates the condition if it goes below $y = x - 1$. This happens if at any point $(a, b)$, $b < a - 1$. We can use a reflection argument to count such paths.\n\n## Step 6: Apply the reflection principle to count paths that go below $y = x - 1$.\nFor a path to go below $y = x - 1$, it must cross the line $y = x - 2$ at some point. Reflecting the path at the first point it touches $y = x - 2$ gives a path from $(0,0)$ to $(n,n)$ that ends at a point that corresponds to a path violating the condition. The reflection principle can be used to count such paths.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the number of paths that violate the condition using the reflection principle.\nThe first time a path touches $y = x - 2$, it is at a point $(k, k-2)$ for some $k$. Reflecting the path after this point gives a path from $(k, k-2)$ to $(n, n)$, which corresponds to a path from $(0,0)$ to $(n-k, n-k+2)$. The number of such paths can be related to $\\binom{n-k+n-k+2}{n-k}$.\n\n## Step 8: Sum over all possible $k$ to find the total number of paths that violate the condition.\nHowever, a more straightforward approach to count admissible paths directly relates to understanding that the condition effectively allows for a certain number of paths to be counted directly or through a combinatorial identity.\n\n## Step 9: Simplify the problem by directly counting or using a known combinatorial formula.\nThe number of admissible paths can be derived by considering the paths that stay above $y = x - 1$. This is related to the concept that the number of paths from $(0,0)$ to $(n,n)$ that stay above $y = x - 1$ can be directly counted or related to known combinatorial numbers.\n\n## Step 10: Recall or derive the formula for the number of admissible paths.\nFor $n \\geq 1$, the number of admissible paths from $(0,0)$ to $(n,n)$ is given by the formula $\\binom{2n}{n} - \\binom{2n}{n-1}$, but we need to verify if this directly applies or if an adjustment is needed due to the specific condition $b \\geq a - 1$.\n\n## Step 11: Verify the formula and simplify if necessary.\nThe formula $\\binom{2n}{n} - \\binom{2n}{n-1}$ simplifies to $\\frac{(2n)!}{n!n!} - \\frac{(2n)!}{(n-1)!(n+1)!} = \\frac{(2n)!}{n!(n+1)!}((n+1) - n) = \\frac{(2n)!}{n!(n+1)!}$.\n\n## Step 12: Simplify the expression to a closed form.\n$\\frac{(2n)!}{n!(n+1)!} = \\frac{1}{n+1}\\binom{2n}{n}$, which is the $n$th Catalan number, $C_n$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{n+1}\\binom{2n}{n}}$",

This $m$ is denoted as $\\frac{1}{k}$ or $k^{-1}$.\n\n## Step 3: Examine the sum $\\sum_{k=1}^{p-1} \\frac{1}{k}$ modulo $p^2$\nTo prove $\\sum_{k=1}^{p-1} \\frac{1}{k} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p^2}$, we need to understand that $\\frac{1}{k}$ is the inverse of $k$ modulo $p^2$. For $k$ and $p-k$, their inverses modulo $p^2$ have a special relationship because $k + (p-k) = p$.\n\n## Step 4: Utilize the property that $k^{-1} + (p-k)^{-1} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$ to simplify the sum\nFirst, notice that for any $k$, $k(p-k) \\equiv -k^2 \\pmod{p}$. The inverse of $k$ modulo $p^2$ is $k^{p^2-2}$ (by Fermat's Little Theorem generalized to $p^2$ for $p$ being prime, but here we directly use properties of modular inverses). We need to examine how $k^{-1}$ and $(p-k)^{-1}$ relate modulo $p^2$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate $k^{-1}$ and $(p-k)^{-1}$ modulo $p^2$\nFor $k$ and $p-k$, we have:\n$k^{-1} \\equiv k^{p-2} \\pmod{p}$ and $(p-k)^{-1} \\equiv (p-k)^{p-2} \\pmod{p}$. Since $(p-k) \\equiv -k \\pmod{p}$, we have $(p-k)^{p-2} \\equiv (-k)^{p-2} \\pmod{p}$. For $p$ odd, $(-1)^{p-2} = -1$, so $(p-k)^{-1} \\equiv -k^{p-2} \\equiv -k^{-1} \\pmod{p}$.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the expression for $k^{-1} + (p-k)^{-1}$ modulo $p^2$\nLet's directly compute $k^{-1} + (p-k)^{-1}$ modulo $p^2$. Since $k(p-k) \\equiv -k^2 \\pmod{p}$, we have $(p-k)^{-1} \\equiv -k(k^2)^{-1} \\pmod{p^2}$. Thus, $k^{-1} + (p-k)^{-1} \\equiv k^{-1} - k(k^2)^{-1} \\pmod{p^2}$. Simplifying, $k^{-1} + (p-k)^{-1} \\equiv k^{-1} - k^{-1} \\pmod{p^2}$ is not correct because it simplifies to $0$, but we need to properly analyze the sum.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze the sum using the property of modular inverses\nFor any $k$, the modular inverse $k^{-1}$ modulo $p^2$ can be expressed as $k^{p^2-2}$, but a more straightforward approach involves using the fact that $\\frac{1}{k} + \\frac{1}{p-k} = \\frac{p}{k(p-k)}$. We need to simplify this expression modulo $p^2$.\n\n## Step 8: Simplify $\\frac{p}{k(p-k)}$ modulo $p^2$\n$\\frac{p}{k(p-k)} = \\frac{p}{kp - k^2}$. Since $p$ is a factor, this is $0 \\pmod{p}$, but to check congruence modulo $p^2$, we need to examine its structure more closely. Notice that $k(p-k) = kp - k^2$, and its inverse modulo $p^2$ is related to $(kp - k^2)^{p^2-2}$.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate the sum $\\sum_{k=1}^{p-1} \\frac{1}{k}$ by pairing terms\nPairing $k$ with $p-k$, we have $\\sum_{k=1}^{p-1} \\frac{1}{k} = \\sum_{k=1}^{(p-1)/2} (\\frac{1}{k} + \\frac{1}{p-k})$. For $p=2m+1$, the sum has $m$ pairs.\n\n## Step 10: Simplify the paired sum\n$\\frac{1}{k} + \\frac{1}{p-k} = \\frac{p-k+k}{k(p-k)} = \\frac{p}{k(p-k)}$. Thus, the sum becomes $\\sum_{k=1}^{(p-1)/2} \\frac{p}{k(p-k)}$.\n\n## Step 11: Examine the congruence of $\\frac{p}{k(p-k)}$ modulo $p^2$\nSince $p$ is a factor of the numerator, $\\frac{p}{k(p-k)}$ is $0 \\pmod{p}$. To check if it's $0 \\pmod{p^2}$, we need to see if $\\frac{1}{k(p-k)}$ is an integer and its properties.\n\n## Step 12: Simplify the expression further to check congruence modulo $p^2$\nFor $1 \\leq k \\leq p-1$, $k(p-k)$ is not divisible by $p$, so $\\frac{1}{k(p-k)}$ is defined modulo $p$. However, we are interested in $\\frac{p}{k(p-k)} \\pmod{p^2}$.\n\n## Step 13: Directly evaluate the sum using properties of modular arithmetic\nSince $\\frac{1}{k} \\equiv k^{p-2} \\pmod{p}$ by Fermat's Little Theorem, and given that we're working modulo $p^2$, let's directly consider the sum and its properties.\n\n## Step 14: Apply Wolstenholme's Theorem for the final proof\nWolstenholme's Theorem states that for a prime $p > 3$, $\\sum_{k=1}^{p-1} \\frac{1}{k} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p^2}$.
