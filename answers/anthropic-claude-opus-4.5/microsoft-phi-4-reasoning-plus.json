        "answer": "To solve the problem, we need to address each part of the question regarding nonstandard models of Peano Arithmetic (PA).\n\n### Part (a): Overspill Lemma\n\n**Statement:** Let $\\phi(x, \\vec{y})$ be a formula in the language of arithmetic, and let $\\vec{b} \\in M$ be parameters. If \n$$\n\\mathcal{M} \\models \\phi(\\underline{n}, \\vec{b})\n$$\nfor every standard natural number $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, then there exists a **nonstandard** element $c \\in M \\setminus \\mathbb{N}$ such that $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\phi(c, \\vec{b})$.\n\n**Proof:**\n\n1. **Assumption:** Assume $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\phi(\\underline{n}, \\vec{b})$ for all standard $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\n2. **Contradiction Approach:** Suppose for contradiction that $\\phi(x, \\vec{b})$ is false for all nonstandard $x \\in M \\setminus \\mathbb{N}$. This means:\n   $$\n   \\mathcal{M} \\models \\neg \\phi(x, \\vec{b}) \\quad \\text{for all } x \\in M \\setminus \\mathbb{N}.\n   $$\n\n3. **Compactness Theorem:** Consider the set of sentences:\n   $$\n   \\{\\phi(\\underline{n}, \\vec{b}) \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\} \\cup \\{\\neg \\phi(x, \\vec{b}) \\mid x \\in M \\setminus \\mathbb{N}\\}.\n   $$\n   This set is finitely satisfiable because for any finite subset, we can find a standard $n$ large enough such that $\\phi(\\underline{n}, \\vec{b})$ holds for all standard $n$ in the subset, and $\\neg \\phi(x, \\vec{b})$ holds for all nonstandard $x$.\n\n4. **Contradiction:** By the Compactness Theorem, the entire set is satisfiable in some model. However, this contradicts the assumption that $\\phi(x, \\vec{b})$ is false for all nonstandard $x$, because the model must satisfy $\\phi(x, \\vec{b})$ for some nonstandard $x$ due to the overspill of truth from standard to nonstandard elements.\n\n5. **Conclusion:** Therefore, there must exist a nonstandard $c \\in M \\setminus \\mathbb{N}$ such that $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\phi(c, \\vec{b})$.\n\n### Part (b): Existence of Nonstandard Exponentiation\n\n**Statement:** Prove that every nonstandard model $\\mathcal{M}$ of PA contains a nonstandard element $a$ such that $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\text{\"}2^a \\text{ exists\"}$ and $\\mathcal{M} \\models 2^a > \\underline{n}$ for every standard $n$.\n\n**Proof:**\n\n1. **Define the Formula:** Consider the formula $\\psi(x) \\equiv \\forall y (y \\leq x \\rightarrow 2^y \\text{ exists})$.\n\n2. **Standard Satisfaction:** For every standard $n$, $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\psi(\\underline{n})$ because exponentiation is defined for all standard numbers.\n\n3. **Apply Overspill Lemma:** By the Overspill Lemma, there exists a nonstandard $a \\in M \\setminus \\mathbb{N}$ such that $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\psi(a)$. This means $2^y$ exists for all $y \\leq a$.\n\n4. **Nonstandard Exponentiation:** Since $a$ is nonstandard, there exists a standard $n$ such that $n < a$. Thus, $2^a$ is defined and $\\mathcal{M} \\models 2^a > \\underline{n}$ for every standard $n$.\n\n### Part (c): Infinitely Many Nonstandard Primes\n\n**Statement:** Prove that every nonstandard model of PA contains infinitely many nonstandard primes.\n\n**Proof:**\n\n1. **Prime Formula:** Let $\\text{Pr}(x)$ denote the formula expressing \"$x$ is prime.\"\n\n2. **Standard Primes:** For every standard prime $p$, $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\text{Pr}(\\underline{p})$.\n\n3. **Apply Overspill Lemma:** By the Overspill Lemma, there exists a nonstandard $p_1 \\in M \\setminus \\mathbb{N}$ such that $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\text{Pr}(p_1)$.\n\n4. **Infinitely Many Nonstandard Primes:** Assume there are only finitely many nonstandard primes $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_k$. Consider the formula $\\phi(x) \\equiv \\text{Pr}(x) \\land \\forall y (y \\leq x \\rightarrow y \\neq p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_k)$.\n\n5. **Standard Satisfaction:** For every standard prime $p$, $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\phi(\\underline{p})$ because $p$ is not among the finitely many nonstandard primes.\n\n6. **Contradiction by Overspill:** By the Overspill Lemma, there exists a nonstandard $p_{k+1} \\in M \\setminus \\mathbb{N}$ such that $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\phi(p_{k+1})$, contradicting the assumption of finitely many nonstandard primes.\n\n7. **Conclusion:** Therefore, there must be infinitely many nonstandard primes in $\\mathcal{M}$.\n\nThis completes the solution to the problem, addressing each part with rigorous reasoning and application of the Overspill Lemma.",

Since \\( b \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p} \\), let \\( b = cp \\). Then:\n\n   \\[\n   cp^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p^2}.\n   \\]\n\n   This implies \\( c \\equiv -1/p \\pmod{p} \\), which is impossible unless \\( c \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p} \\). Therefore, \\( b \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p} \\), and hence \\( S \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p^2} \\).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThus, we have shown that:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=1}^{p-1} \\frac{1}{k} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p^2}.\n\\]\n\nThis completes the proof. The final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]",
