        "answer": "**Solution**\n\n### (a) Overspill Lemma\n\nLet $\\mathcal{M} = (M,0,S,+,\\cdot,<)$ be a nonstandard model of PA, and let $\\phi(x,\\vec{y})$ be a formula with parameters $\\vec{b}\\in M$. Assume that for every standard natural number $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$,\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{M}\\models \\phi(\\underline{n},\\vec{b}).\n$$\n\nWe must show that there exists a nonstandard element $c\\in M\\setminus\\mathbb{N}$ such that $\\mathcal{M}\\models \\phi(c,\\vec{b})$.\n\n*Proof.* Suppose, towards a contradiction, that no nonstandard element satisfies $\\phi(x,\\vec{b})$. Then $\\neg\\phi(x,\\vec{b})$ holds for every nonstandard $x$. Because $\\mathcal{M}$ is nonstandard, there exists at least one nonstandard element, so the set $\\{x\\in M : \\neg\\phi(x,\\vec{b})\\}$ is nonempty and definable. By the least number principle (equivalent to induction in PA), this set has a least element; call it $d$. Since $\\phi(0,\\vec{b})$ holds (0 is standard), we have $d>0$.\n\nFor any $x<d$, $\\phi(x,\\vec{b})$ holds. By our assumption, such an $x$ cannot be nonstandard (otherwise it would satisfy $\\neg\\phi$), so every $x<d$ is standard. Thus the set $\\{x\\in M : x<d\\}$ is exactly the standard natural numbers. Consequently, $d$ is the smallest nonstandard element. In PA every nonzero element has a predecessor, so let $d-1$ be the unique element with $S(d-1)=d$. Then $d-1<d$, hence $d-1$ is standard. But then $d = S(d-1)$ is also standard, contradicting that $d$ is nonstandard.\n\nTherefore the assumption is false, and there must exist a nonstandard $c$ with $\\mathcal{M}\\models \\phi(c,\\vec{b})$. \u220e\n\n---\n\n### (b) Existence of a nonstandard element with huge power of two\n\nWe use the Overspill Lemma. In PA, exponentiation can be defined by a formula $\\mathrm{Exp}(x,y,z)$ that is provably total and functional; we write $2^a$ for the unique $z$ such that $\\mathrm{Exp}(2,a,z)$. PA also proves $\\forall x\\,(2^x > x)$ by induction.\n\nDefine the formula\n\n$$\n\\phi(x) \\;=\\; \\exists y\\,\\bigl(\\mathrm{Exp}(2,x,y) \\;\\wedge\\; y > x\\bigr).\n$$\n\nFor every standard $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$, PA proves that $2^n$ exists and $2^n > n$; hence $\\mathcal{M}\\models \\phi(\\underline{n})$. By Overspill, there exists a nonstandard $c\\in M\\setminus\\mathbb{N}$ such that $\\mathcal{M}\\models \\phi(c)$. Choose a witness $d$ with $\\mathrm{Exp}(2,c,d)$ and $d > c$.\n\nBecause $c$ is nonstandard, it is larger than every standard natural number: for each $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$, $c > \\underline{n}$. Then $d > c > \\underline{n}$, so $d > \\underline{n}$ for all standard $n$. Moreover, $d = 2^c$ by functionality of $\\mathrm{Exp}$. Thus $a = c$ satisfies the required conditions. \u220e\n\n---\n\n### (c) Infinitely many nonstandard primes\n\nRecall that PA proves Euclid\u2019s theorem: $\\forall x\\,\\exists y\\,(y > x \\wedge \\mathrm{Pr}(y))$, where $\\mathrm{Pr}(y)$ formalises \u201c$y$ is prime\u201d. In particular, for every standard $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$,\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{M}\\models \\exists y\\,(y > \\underline{n} \\wedge \\mathrm{Pr}(y)).\n$$\n\nConsider the formula\n\n$$\n\\psi(x) \\;=\\; \\exists y\\,(y > x \\wedge \\mathrm{Pr}(y)).\n$$\n\nBy the Overspill Lemma (part (a)), there exists a nonstandard $c\\in M\\setminus\\mathbb{N}$ such that $\\mathcal{M}\\models \\psi(c)$. Choose a witness $p_0$ with $p_0 > c$ and $\\mathrm{Pr}(p_0)$. Since $c$ is nonstandard, $p_0 > c > \\underline{n}$ for all standard $n$; therefore $p_0$ is a nonstandard prime.\n\nNow, because $\\mathcal{M}\\models \\forall x\\,\\exists y\\,(y > x \\wedge \\mathrm{Pr}(y))$, we can iterate this property externally. Starting with $p_0$, we obtain $p_1$ with $p_1 > p_0$ and $\\mathrm{Pr}(p_1)$; then $p_2$ with $p_2 > p_1$ and $\\mathrm{Pr}(p_2)$; and so on. Each $p_k$ is nonstandard (as it exceeds all standard numbers) and the sequence $p_0 < p_1 < p_2 < \\cdots$ is strictly increasing, hence its terms are distinct. Thus $\\mathcal{M}$ contains infinitely many nonstandard primes. \u220e\n\n*Alternative approach:* One may also apply Overspill directly to the formalised statement \u201cthere exist at least $k$ distinct primes greater than $k$\u201d (using sequence coding) to obtain a nonstandard $K$ giving infinitely many nonstandard primes in one step. The above argument is simpler and still relies on Overspill for the initial existence of a nonstandard prime.",

        "answer": "We are to count lattice paths from $(0,0)$ to $(n,n)$ using steps $(1,0)$ (R) and $(0,1)$ (U) that never go strictly below the line $y = x-1$, i.e., for every point $(a,b)$ on the path we have $b \\ge a-1$.\n\n**Step 1: Reformulate the condition.**  \nRepresent a path as a sequence of $2n$ steps containing exactly $n$ R\u2019s and $n$ U\u2019s. After $k$ steps let $r_k$ be the number of R\u2019s and $u_k$ the number of U\u2019s, so the current point is $(r_k,u_k)$. Define the difference $d_k = u_k - r_k$. Initially $d_0 = 0$ and at the end $d_{2n}=0$. Each R step decreases $d$ by $1$, each U step increases $d$ by $1$. The admissibility condition becomes  \n$$\nd_k \\ge -1 \\quad\\text{for all }k.\n$$\n\n**Step 2: Shift to a non\u2011negative walk.**  \nSet $e_k = d_k + 1$. Then $e_0 = 1$, $e_{2n}=1$, and the steps are still $+1$ for U and $-1$ for R. The condition is now  \n$$\ne_k \\ge 0 \\quad\\text{for all }k.\n$$  \nThus we are counting walks on the non\u2011negative integers that start at $1$, end at $1$, consist of $n$ up\u2011steps $(+1)$ and $n$ down\u2011steps $(-1)$, and never fall below $0$.\n\n**Step 3: Bijection with Dyck paths.**  \nGiven such a walk $W$ of length $2n$, construct a new walk $W'$ by  \n- prepending an up\u2011step $(+1)$ at the beginning, and  \n- appending a down\u2011step $(-1)$ at the end.  \n\n$W'$ then starts at $0$ (after the prepended step we are at $1$), follows $W$ (which stays $\\ge 0$), ends at $1$ after the $2n$ steps, and finally goes down to $0$. Hence $W'$ is a walk of length $2n+2$ from $0$ to $0$ that never goes below $0$ \u2013 a Dyck path. Moreover, $W'$ has $n+1$ up\u2011steps and $n+1$ down\u2011steps.\n\nConversely, any Dyck path of length $2n+2$ must start with an up\u2011step and end with a down\u2011step (otherwise it would go negative or not return to $0$). Removing the first and the last step yields a walk from $1$ to $1$ of length $2n$ that never goes below $0$. This gives a bijection between the admissible walks (and hence the original lattice paths) and Dyck paths of semilength $n+1$.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the Catalan formula.**  \nThe number of Dyck paths of semilength $m$ is the Catalan number  \n$$\nC_m = \\frac{1}{m+1}\\binom{2m}{m}.\n$$  \nSetting $m = n+1$ we obtain  \n$$\nC_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{n+2}\\binom{2n+2}{n+1}.\n$$  \n\nTherefore, the number of admissible lattice paths from $(0,0)$ to $(n,n)$ is  \n$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{n+2}\\binom{2n+2}{n+1}}.\n$$  \n\n(Equivalently, one may write $\\binom{2n}{n} - \\binom{2n}{n+2}$.)",

Reduction to an elementary symmetric sum\n\nLet $a_k$ be the inverse of $k$ modulo $p^2$ (with $1\\le a_k<p^2$). Set\n\n$$\nS = \\sum_{k=1}^{p-1} a_k.\n$$\n\nFor each $k$ write $(p-1)! = k \\cdot m_k$ where $m_k = (p-1)!/k$ is an integer.

Subtracting $s_{p-1} = (p-1)!$ from both sides yields\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=0}^{p-2} (-1)^i s_i\\, p^{p-1-i} = 0.\n$$\n\nEvery term in this sum contains at least one factor $p$ (for $i=p-2$ the exponent is $1$; for $i\\le p-3$ it is at least $2$). Dividing the integer equality by $p$ we obtain\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=0}^{p-2} (-1)^i s_i\\, p^{p-2-i} = 0. \\tag{1}\n$$\n\nIsolate the term with $i=p-2$:\n\n$$\n(-1)^{p-2} s_{p-2} + \\sum_{i=0}^{p-3} (-1)^i s_i\\, p^{p-2-i} = 0.\n$$\n\nSince $p-2$ is odd, $(-1)^{p-2} = -1$, so\n\n$$\ns_{p-2} = \\sum_{i=0}^{p-3} (-1)^i s_i\\, p^{p-2-i}. \\tag{2}\n$$\n\nIn the right\u2011hand sum, for $i=p-3$ the exponent of $p$ is $1$ and $(-1)^{p-3}=1$ (because $p-3$ is even), giving the term $s_{p-3}p$.

Over the field $\\mathbb{F}_p$, the numbers $1,2,\\dots,p-1$ are all the nonzero residues, and each satisfies $a^{p-1}\\equiv 1\\pmod{p}$ (Fermat). Thus both $P(x)$ and $x^{p-1}-1$ are monic polynomials of degree $p-1$ having exactly these $p-1$ distinct roots in $\\mathbb{F}_p$. Consequently,\n\n$$\nP(x) \\equiv x^{p-1} - 1 \\pmod{p}\n$$\n\nas polynomials. Comparing coefficients, for $1\\le i\\le p-2$ the coefficient of $x^{p-1-i}$ in $x^{p-1}-1$ is $0$, while in $P(x)$ it is $(-1)^i s_i$.
