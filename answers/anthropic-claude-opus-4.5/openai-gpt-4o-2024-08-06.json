        "answer": "To address the problem, we need to explore the properties of nonstandard models of Peano Arithmetic (PA) and apply the Overspill Lemma. Let's tackle each part step by step.\n\n### Part (a): Prove the Overspill Lemma\n\n**Statement**: Let $\\phi(x, \\vec{y})$ be a formula in the language of arithmetic, and let $\\vec{b} \\in M$ be parameters. If \n$$\\mathcal{M} \\models \\phi(\\underline{n}, \\vec{b})$$\nfor every standard natural number $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, then there exists a **nonstandard** element $c \\in M \\setminus \\mathbb{N}$ such that $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\phi(c, \\vec{b})$.\n\n**Proof**: Assume for contradiction that no such nonstandard $c$ exists. This means that for every $m \\in M$, if $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\phi(m, \\vec{b})$, then $m$ must be standard, i.e., $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$. \n\nDefine the set $S = \\{ m \\in M \\mid \\mathcal{M} \\models \\phi(m, \\vec{b}) \\}$. By assumption, $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{N}$. Since $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\phi(\\underline{n}, \\vec{b})$ for every standard $n$, we have $\\mathbb{N} \\subseteq S$. Thus, $S = \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nHowever, in a nonstandard model $\\mathcal{M}$, $M$ properly contains $\\mathbb{N}$, and $S$ being equal to $\\mathbb{N}$ contradicts the fact that $S$ should be a definable subset of $M$ that is closed under the properties of $\\phi$. Therefore, there must exist a nonstandard $c \\in M \\setminus \\mathbb{N}$ such that $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\phi(c, \\vec{b})$. This completes the proof of the Overspill Lemma.\n\n### Part (b): Existence of a Nonstandard Element $a$ with $2^a > \\underline{n}$ for All Standard $n$\n\n**Proof**: Consider the formula $\\phi(x)$ defined as \"$2^x$ exists and $2^x > \\underline{n}$ for all standard $n$\". \n\nFor each standard $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, we can find a standard $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $2^m > n$. Thus, $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\phi(\\underline{m})$ for some standard $m$. By the Overspill Lemma, there exists a nonstandard $a \\in M \\setminus \\mathbb{N}$ such that $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\phi(a)$, meaning $2^a$ exists and $2^a > \\underline{n}$ for every standard $n$. \n\n### Part (c): Infinitely Many Nonstandard Primes\n\n**Proof**: Consider the formula $\\phi(x)$ defined as \"$x$ is prime\". For every standard $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, there exists a prime $p > n$. Thus, $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\phi(\\underline{p})$ for some standard prime $p$. By the Overspill Lemma, there exists a nonstandard prime $p \\in M \\setminus \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nTo show there are infinitely many nonstandard primes, assume for contradiction that there are only finitely many nonstandard primes. Let $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_k$ be all the nonstandard primes. Consider a nonstandard element $c$ such that $c > p_i$ for all $i$. By the properties of nonstandard models, there exists a prime $q > c$, which must be nonstandard, contradicting the assumption that $p_1, \\ldots, p_k$ were all the nonstandard primes. Thus, there must be infinitely many nonstandard primes.\n\nThis completes the proof for all parts of the question.",

        "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of admissible lattice paths from $(0,0)$ to $(n,n)$ that never pass strictly below the line $y = x - 1$. These paths are known as \"Dyck paths\" of length $2n$.\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Path Constraints:**\n   - A path consists of $n$ right steps (R) and $n$ up steps (U).\n   - The path starts at $(0,0)$ and ends at $(n,n)$.\n   - The condition $b \\geq a - 1$ translates to the path never going below the line $y = x - 1$.\n\n2. **Dyck Path Definition:**\n   - A Dyck path is a lattice path from $(0,0)$ to $(n,n)$ that never goes below the line $y = x$.\n   - By shifting the line $y = x$ to $y = x - 1$, we are effectively counting paths that are one unit above the standard Dyck path condition.\n\n3. **Catalan Numbers:**\n   - The number of Dyck paths from $(0,0)$ to $(n,n)$ is given by the $n$-th Catalan number $C_n$.\n   - The $n$-th Catalan number is given by the formula:\n     $$\n     C_n = \\frac{1}{n+1} \\binom{2n}{n}\n     $$\n\n4. **Derivation of the Formula:**\n   - The total number of paths from $(0,0)$ to $(n,n)$ without any restrictions is $\\binom{2n}{n}$, as we choose $n$ steps to be right (or equivalently, up) out of $2n$ total steps.\n   - The Catalan number $C_n$ counts only those paths that satisfy the Dyck path condition, which in this case is equivalent to the admissible path condition.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The number of admissible paths from $(0,0)$ to $(n,n)$ that never pass strictly below the line $y = x - 1$ is given by the $n$-th Catalan number.\n\nThus, the number of admissible paths is:\n$$\nC_n = \\frac{1}{n+1} \\binom{2n}{n}\n$$\n\nThis is the closed-form expression for the number of admissible paths as a function of $n$.",
