        "answer": "**Solution:**\n\n**(a) Overspill Lemma:**\n\nGiven that $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\phi(\\underline{n}, \\vec{b})$ for every standard natural number $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, we want to show that there exists a nonstandard element $c \\in M \\setminus \\mathbb{N}$ such that $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\phi(c, \\vec{b})$.\n\nSince $\\mathcal{M}$ is a nonstandard model of PA, it satisfies the Overspill Principle, which states that any property true for all standard natural numbers must also hold for some nonstandard element.\n\nLet's assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there is no such nonstandard element $c$ satisfying $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\phi(c, \\vec{b})$. This would imply that the property defined by $\\phi(x, \\vec{b})$ is false for all nonstandard elements, contradicting the Overspill Principle.\n\nTherefore, there must exist a nonstandard element $c \\in M \\setminus \\mathbb{N}$ such that $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\phi(c, \\vec{b})$, proving the Overspill Lemma.\n\n**(b) Existence of Nonstandard Element for Exponentiation:**\n\nUsing the Overspill Lemma, we can prove that every nonstandard model $\\mathcal{M}$ of PA contains a nonstandard element $a$ such that $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\text{\"}2^a \\text{ exists\"}$ and $\\mathcal{M} \\models 2^a > \\underline{n}$ for every standard $n$.\n\nConsider the formula $\\phi(x) = \\exists y (x = 2^y)$, which expresses that $x$ is a power of 2. Since $\\phi(\\underline{n})$ holds for every standard $n$, by the Overspill Lemma, there exists a nonstandard element $a \\in M \\setminus \\mathbb{N}$ such that $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\phi(a)$, meaning $2^a$ exists in $\\mathcal{M}$.\n\nTo show that $2^a > \\underline{n}$ for every standard $n$, we can use a similar argument. Consider the formula $\\psi(x, y) = x > 2^y$. Since $\\psi(x, \\underline{n})$ holds for every standard $n$, by the Overspill Lemma, there exists a nonstandard element $a \\in M \\setminus \\mathbb{N}$ such that $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\psi(2^a, \\underline{n})$, which implies $2^a > \\underline{n}$ for every standard $n$.\n\nTherefore, every nonstandard model of PA contains a nonstandard element $a$ such that $2^a$ exists and $2^a > \\underline{n}$ for every standard $n$.\n\n**(c) Existence of Infinitely Many Nonstandard Primes:**\n\nTo prove that every nonstandard model of PA contains infinitely many nonstandard primes, we can use a similar argument as in part (b) by applying the Overspill Lemma.\n\nConsider the formula $\\text{Pr}(x)$ expressing \"$x$ is prime.\" Since there are infinitely many prime numbers in the standard natural numbers, for each prime $p$, the formula $\\text{Pr}(\\underline{p})$ holds.\n\nBy the Overspill Lemma, there exists a nonstandard element $p \\in M \\setminus \\mathbb{N}$ such that $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\text{Pr}(p)$ for each standard prime $p$. Since there are infinitely many standard primes, there are infinitely many nonstandard primes in $\\mathcal{M}$.\n\nTherefore, every nonstandard model of PA contains infinitely many nonstandard primes.",

        "answer": "To determine the number of admissible paths from $(0,0)$ to $(n,n)$, we can approach this problem using combinatorics and dynamic programming.\n\nLet $A(n)$ denote the number of admissible paths from $(0,0)$ to $(n,n)$. We can observe that for a path to be admissible, at each point $(a, b)$ on the path, we must have $b \\geq a - 1$. This condition implies that the path can only move upwards or to the right, never crossing the line $y = x - 1$.\n\nNow, let's consider the last step of an admissible path from $(0,0)$ to $(n,n)$. The last step must be either an up step or a right step. If the last step is an up step, then the path must have reached the point $(n-1, n)$ in the previous steps. If the last step is a right step, then the path must have reached the point $(n, n-1)$ in the previous steps.\n\nTherefore, the number of admissible paths from $(0,0)$ to $(n,n)$ can be expressed as the sum of the number of admissible paths from $(0,0)$ to $(n-1,n)$ and from $(0,0)$ to $(n,n-1)$. Mathematically, we have:\n\n$$ A(n) = A(n-1) + A(n-1) $$\n\nSolving this recurrence relation, we find that:\n\n$$ A(n) = 2A(n-1) $$\n\nwith the initial condition $A(1) = 2$ (as there are two admissible paths from $(0,0)$ to $(1,1)$).\n\nBy iteratively applying the recurrence relation, we get:\n\n$$ A(n) = 2^{n-1} $$\n\nTherefore, the number of admissible paths from $(0,0)$ to $(n,n)$ is given by $2^{n-1}$.",

Let this inverse be denoted by $m_k$ such that $km_k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p^2}$.\n\nNow, consider the sum $\\sum_{k=1}^{p-1} \\frac{1}{k}$. We can rewrite this sum in terms of the multiplicative inverses $m_k$ as follows:\n\n$$\\sum_{k=1}^{p-1} \\frac{1}{k} = \\sum_{k=1}^{p-1} m_k.$$\n\nSince each $m_k$ is the unique multiplicative inverse of $k$ modulo $p^2$, we can rewrite the sum as:\n\n$$\\sum_{k=1}^{p-1} m_k \\equiv \\sum_{k=1}^{p-1} k^{-1} \\pmod{p^2}.$$\n\nNow, notice that for each $k$ from $1$ to $p-1$, there exists a unique $1 \\leq j \\leq p-1$ such that $kj \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$.

Therefore, we have:\n\n$$\\sum_{k=1}^{p-1} k \\equiv \\frac{p(p-1)}{2} \\pmod{p^2}.$$\n\nSince $p > 3$, we know that $p$ and $p-1$ are both even. Thus, $\\frac{p(p-1)}{2}$ is divisible by $p^2$, which implies:\n\n$$\\sum_{k=1}^{p-1} k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p^2}.$$\n\nTherefore, we have shown that $\\sum_{k=1}^{p-1} \\frac{1}{k} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p^2}$ for a prime $p > 3$.",
