        "answer": "**Answer:**\n\n### Part 1: Proving $\\sim$ is an Equivalence Relation on $S$\n\nTo prove that $\\sim$ is an equivalence relation on $S$, we need to show that it satisfies three properties: reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity.\n\n1. **Reflexivity**: For any function $f \\in S$, we need to show that $f \\sim f$. This means there exists a natural number $M$ such that $f(n) = f(n)$ for all $n \\geq M$, which is trivially true for any $M = 1$ since the functions are defined on $\\mathbb{N}$.\n\n2. **Symmetry**: For any functions $f, g \\in S$, if $f \\sim g$, then we need to show that $g \\sim f$. If $f \\sim g$, there exists a natural number $M_1$ such that $f(n) = g(n)$ for all $n \\geq M_1$. Since this relation holds, we can choose $M_2 = M_1$ to satisfy $g(n) = f(n)$ for all $n \\geq M_2$, thus proving symmetry.\n\n3. **Transitivity**: For any functions $f, g, h \\in S$, if $f \\sim g$ and $g \\sim h$, then we need to show that $f \\sim h$. If $f \\sim g$, there exists a natural number $M_1$ such that $f(n) = g(n)$ for all $n \\geq M_1$. Similarly, if $g \\sim h$, there exists a natural number $M_2$ such that $g(n) = h(n)$ for all $n \\geq M_2$. By choosing $M = \\max(M_1, M_2)$, we have $f(n) = g(n) = h(n)$ for all $n \\geq M$, thus proving transitivity.\n\nTherefore, $\\sim$ is an equivalence relation on $S$.\n\n### Part 2: Determining the Number of Equivalence Classes\n\nEach equivalence class under this relation corresponds to a set of functions that are indistinguishable after a certain point. To determine the number of equivalence classes, we need to consider the different patterns of functions that can arise.\n\n1. **Constant Functions**: Functions that are constant after a certain point form one equivalence class. There are two possibilities: the constant function $f(n) = 0$ and the constant function $f(n) = 1$. So, there are 2 equivalence classes for constant functions.\n\n2. **Non-constant Functions**: Functions that switch values at some point form another equivalence class. For these functions, there are $2^{k}$ possibilities where $k$ is the number of switches from 0 to 1 or vice versa. Since $k$ can be any non-negative integer, the number of equivalence classes for non-constant functions is the cardinality of the set of non-negative integers, which is countably infinite.\n\nTherefore, the total number of equivalence classes under this relation is $2 + \\infty = \\infty$.\n\nThus, there are infinitely many equivalence classes under the relation $\\sim$ on the set $S$ of functions $f: \\mathbb{N} \\to \\{0, 1\\}$.",

This shows that $gkg^{-1} \\in \\text{Ker}(\\phi)$, and thus $\\text{Ker}(\\phi)$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.\n\n**2. Show that $\\text{Ker}(\\phi)$ is contained in $H$:**\n\nFrom the definition of the kernel, $\\text{Ker}(\\phi) = \\{ g \\in G \\mid gH = H \\}$. Since $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, $e \\in H$ where $e$ is the identity element of $G$. Therefore, $eH = H$, implying that $e \\in \\text{Ker}(\\phi)$.\n\nNow, for any $g \\in \\text{Ker}(\\phi)$, we have $gH = H$. Multiplying both sides by $g^{-1}$ on the right gives $g = h$ for some $h \\in H$. Thus, $\\text{Ker}(\\phi) \\subseteq H$.\n\n**3. Determine the index $[G : \\text{Ker}(\\phi)]$ in terms of $n$ and $m$:**\n\nThe index $[G : \\text{Ker}(\\phi)]$ is defined as the number of left cosets of $\\text{Ker}(\\phi)$ in $G$. By Lagrange's theorem, the index is given by $[G : \\text{Ker}(\\phi)] = \\frac{|G|}{|\\text{Ker}(\\phi)|}$.\n\nSince $|\\text{Ker}(\\phi)| = |H| = m$ and $|G| = n$, we have $[G : \\text{Ker}(\\phi)] = \\frac{n}{m}$.\n\n**4. If $G$ is a simple group, what can you conclude about $H$ and $\\text{Ker}(\\phi)$:**\n\nIf $G$ is a simple group, it means that $G$ has no nontrivial proper normal subgroups. From part 1, we have shown that $\\text{Ker}(\\phi)$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. Since $G$ is simple, the only possibilities for $\\text{Ker}(\\phi)$ are the trivial subgroup $\\{e\\}$ or $G$ itself.\n\nIf $\\text{Ker}(\\phi) = \\{e\\}$, then $H = \\text{Ker}(\\phi) = \\{e\\}$, implying that $H$ is the trivial subgroup.\n\nIf $\\text{Ker}(\\phi) = G$, then $H = G$, meaning that $H$ is the whole group $G$.\n\nTherefore, if $G$ is a simple group, $H$ is either the trivial subgroup or the whole group $G$, and $\\text{Ker}(\\phi)$ is either the trivial subgroup or the whole group $G$.",

However, this would violate the inequality $|f(z)| \\leq |z|^2 + 1$ for large $|z|$, as the term $a_m z^m$ would dominate the right-hand side. This contradiction implies that $m \\leq 2$.\n\nTherefore, $f(z)$ is a polynomial of degree at most 2.\n\n#### 2. Determining all such functions $f$:\n\nLet $f(z) = az^2 + bz + c$ be a polynomial of degree at most 2. We need to determine the coefficients $a, b, c$ such that $|f(z)| \\leq |z|^2 + 1$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$.\n\nSubstitute $f(z) = az^2 + bz + c$ into the inequality:\n$$|az^2 + bz + c| \\leq |z|^2 + 1.$$\n\nExpanding the left side and comparing coefficients, we get:\n$$|a| \\leq 1, \\quad |b| \\leq 0, \\quad |c| \\leq 1.$$\n\nTherefore, all such functions $f$ satisfying the given inequality are of the form $f(z) = az^2 + c$ where $|a| \\leq 1$ and $|c| \\leq 1$.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nWe have shown that any entire function $f: \\mathbb{C} \\to \\mathbb{C}$ satisfying $|f(z)| \\leq |z|^2 + 1$ is a polynomial of degree at most 2, and we have determined that all such functions are of the form $f(z) = az^2 + c$ where $|a| \\leq 1$ and $|c| \\leq 1$.",

        "answer": "**Answer:**\n\n### Existence and Uniqueness of Global Smooth Solution\n\nGiven the partial differential equation (PDE):\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\Delta u + f(u)\n$$\n\nwith initial condition $u(x, 0) = g(x)$, where $u = u(x, t)$ is a function defined on $\\mathbb{R}^n \\times [0, \\infty)$, $\\Delta$ is the Laplacian operator in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, and $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a smooth function satisfying $f(0) = 0$ and $f'(0) > 0$, and $g(x)$ is a smooth function with compact support.\n\nTo prove the existence and uniqueness of a global smooth solution, we will use the method of characteristics. The characteristics of this PDE are given by the system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = 0, \\quad \\frac{dt}{dt} = 1, \\quad \\frac{du}{dt} = \\Delta u + f(u)\n$$\n\nThe first two equations imply that $x$ is constant along the characteristics, and $t$ increases linearly along the characteristics. The third equation represents the evolution of $u$ along the characteristics.\n\nSince $x$ is constant along the characteristics, we can write $u(x, t)$ as $u(x(t), t)$. Using the chain rule, we have:\n\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dt} = \\frac{du}{dx} \\frac{dx}{dt} + \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}\n$$\n\nSubstituting this into the third ODE above, we get:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\Delta u + f(u)\n$$\n\nwhich is the original PDE. This implies that $u(x(t), t)$ satisfies the PDE along the characteristics.\n\nNow, we need to solve the characteristic ODEs to find the characteristics. Since $\\frac{dx}{dt} = 0$, the characteristics are straight lines parallel to the $x$-axis. Therefore, the solution $u(x, t)$ is constant along these lines.\n\nGiven the initial condition $u(x, 0) = g(x)$, we can write the solution as $u(x, t) = g(x)$ for all $t \\geq 0$. This solution satisfies the PDE and the initial condition.\n\nHence, there exists a unique global smooth solution $u(x, t)$ that remains smooth for all $t \\geq 0$.\n\n### Conditions for Solution to Approach Zero as $t \\to \\infty$\n\nTo determine the conditions under which the solution $u(x, t)$ approaches zero as $t \\to \\infty$, we consider the behavior of $f(u)$ for large $u$.\n\nGiven that $f'(0) > 0$, there exists $\\epsilon > 0$ such that $f(u) > 0$ for $u > \\epsilon$. This implies that for large $u$, the term $f(u)$ dominates the Laplacian term $\\Delta u$.\n\nAs $t \\to \\infty$, the solution $u(x, t)$ will be dominated by the term $f(u)$, causing $u(x, t)$ to approach a steady state solution where $f(u) = 0$.

This implies that $u(x(t), t)$ satisfies the PDE along the characteristics.\n\nNow, we need to solve the characteristic ODEs to find the characteristics. Since $\\frac{dx}{dt} = 0$, the characteristics are straight lines parallel to the $x$-axis. Therefore, the solution $u(x, t)$ is constant along these lines.\n\nGiven the initial condition $u(x, 0) = g(x)$, we can write the solution as $u(x, t) = g(x)$ for all $t \\geq 0$.

It helps in understanding the spectral properties of $T$ and its relationship with the underlying Hilbert space.\n\nIn conclusion, the convergence of the sequence $\\{\\lambda_n\\}$ to zero and the convergence of the series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} |\\lambda_n|^2$ play a crucial role in characterizing the operator $T$ in the context of compact and self-adjoint operators on a separable Hilbert space.",
