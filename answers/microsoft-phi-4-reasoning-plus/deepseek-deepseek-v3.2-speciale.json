If $x$ were join\u2011irreducible, then $x\\in J(a)$ and therefore $x\\le\\bigvee J(a)$, a contradiction. Thus $x$ is not join\u2011irreducible, so there exist $u,v<x$ with $x = u\\vee v$. By minimality of $x$, both $u$ and $v$ are $\\le\\bigvee J(a)$, hence $x = u\\vee v \\le \\bigvee J(a)$, again a contradiction. Therefore $\\bigvee J(a)=a$. In particular, every element (including $0$ as the empty join) can be written as a join of join\u2011irreducible elements.\n\n**Irredundant representations.** A set $S\\subseteq J(L)$ is called an *irredundant join\u2011cover* of $a$ if $a = \\bigvee S$ and for every $s\\in S$ we have $s\\nleq \\bigvee(S\\setminus\\{s\\})$. Starting from the (possibly redundant) set $J(a)$ we can obtain an irredundant one by repeatedly removing any element that is $\\le$ the join of the remaining ones. Equivalently, take the set of *maximal* elements of $J(a)$ (with respect to the order of $L$); call it $M(a)$. Because every element of $J(a)$ lies below some maximal one, $\\bigvee M(a) = \\bigvee J(a) = a$. If some $m\\in M(a)$ satisfied $m\\le\\bigvee(M(a)\\setminus\\{m\\})$, then by the lemma $m\\le m'$ for some $m'\\in M(a)\\setminus\\{m\\}$, contradicting maximality of $m$. Hence $M(a)$ is irredundant. Thus every element admits an irredundant join\u2011cover consisting of join\u2011irreducible elements.\n\n**Uniqueness.** Let $S$ and $T$ be two irredundant join\u2011covers of $a$. For any $s\\in S$ we have $s\\le a = \\bigvee T$. Since $s$ is join\u2011prime (by the lemma), there exists $t\\in T$ with $s\\le t$. Applying the same argument to $t$ yields an $s'\\in S$ with $t\\le s'$. Hence $s\\le t\\le s'$. Because $S$ is irredundant, distinct elements of $S$ are incomparable: if $s\\ne s'$ and $s\\le s'$, then $s\\le\\bigvee(S\\setminus\\{s\\})$ (as $s'\\in S\\setminus\\{s\\}$), contradicting irredundancy. Therefore $s=s'$ and consequently $s=t$. This shows $S\\subseteq T$; by symmetry $T\\subseteq S$, so $S=T$.\n\nThus each element of $L$ can be expressed as a join of join\u2011irreducible elements, and the irredundant representation is unique. (The representation using all join\u2011irreducibles below the element is also unique, but it is not the one usually referred to; the irredundant version is the one that is truly unique without further qualifications.)\n\n### 2. Number of join\u2011irreducibles when $L\\cong\\mathcal{O}(P)$\n\nAssume $L$ is isomorphic to the lattice $\\mathcal{O}(P)$ of all lower sets (order ideals) of a finite poset $P$, ordered by inclusion. The join in $\\mathcal{O}(P)$ is union.\n\n**Claim.** The join\u2011irreducible elements of $\\mathcal{O}(P)$ are exactly the principal lower sets $\\downarrow\\! p = \\{x\\in P\\mid x\\le p\\}$ for $p\\in P$.\n\n*Proof.* Let $I\\in\\mathcal{O}(P)$. If $I$ is not principal, then there exist two distinct maximal elements $p,q\\in I$ (or $I=\\emptyset$). Then $I = (\\downarrow\\! p)\\cup (\\downarrow\\! q)$ with both proper subsets, so $I$ is not join\u2011irreducible. Conversely, suppose $I=\\downarrow\\! p$. If $\\downarrow\\! p = A\\cup B$ with $A,B$ lower sets, then $p\\in A$ or $p\\in B$. If $p\\in A$, then because $A$ is a lower set, $\\downarrow\\! p\\subseteq A$, so $A=\\downarrow\\! p$. Hence $\\downarrow\\! p$ is join\u2011irreducible. (The empty set, which would correspond to the bottom element, is not join\u2011irreducible by definition.) \u220e\n\nTherefore the number of join\u2011irreducible elements of $L$ equals the number of elements of $P$:\n$$\n|J(L)| = |P|.\n$$\n\n### 3.

Proof that $(C,+)$ is an abelian group\n\nWe prove that the operation defined above satisfies the group axioms. The only non\u2011trivial part is associativity; we establish it by relating the geometric addition to the divisor class group of $C$.\n\n#### 3.1 Divisors and the Picard group\n\nLet $\\operatorname{Div}(C)$ be the free abelian group on the points of $C$. The **degree** of a divisor $D = \\sum n_P (P)$ is $\\deg D = \\sum n_P$. A divisor is **principal** if it equals $(f) = \\sum \\operatorname{ord}_P(f)\\,(P)$ for some non\u2011zero rational function $f\\in\\mathbb{C}(C)^\\times$. Two divisors $D_1,D_2$ are **linearly equivalent**, written $D_1\\sim D_2$, if $D_1-D_2$ is principal. The set of equivalence classes of degree\u20110 divisors forms an abelian group\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Pic}^0(C) = \\operatorname{Div}^0(C)/\\sim.\n$$\n\n#### 3.2 Riemann\u2013Roch and a bijection $C \\to \\operatorname{Pic}^0(C)$\n\nBecause $C$ is a nonsingular projective curve of genus $g=1$, the Riemann\u2013Roch theorem states that for any divisor $D$,\n\n$$\n\\ell(D) - \\ell(K-D) = \\deg D,\n$$\n\nwhere $\\ell(D)=\\dim_\\mathbb{C} L(D)$ and $K$ is a canonical divisor (with $\\deg K = 0$). In particular, if $\\deg D > 0$ then $\\ell(K-D)=0$ and $\\ell(D)=\\deg D$.\n\nDefine a map\n\n$$\n\\varphi : C \\longrightarrow \\operatorname{Pic}^0(C), \\qquad \\varphi(P) = [\\,(P) - (\\mathcal{O})\\,].\n$$\n\n* **Surjectivity:** Let $D$ be a divisor of degree $0$. Then $D+(\\mathcal{O})$ has degree $1$. By Riemann\u2013Roch, $\\ell(D+(\\mathcal{O})) = 1$. Hence there exists a non\u2011zero function $f\\in L(D+(\\mathcal{O}))$, i.e. $(f) + D + (\\mathcal{O}) \\geq 0$. Since its degree is $1$, it must be a single point: $(f) + D + (\\mathcal{O}) = (P)$ for some $P\\in C$. Thus $(f) = (P) - D - (\\mathcal{O})$, so $D \\sim (P)-(\\mathcal{O})$ and $[D] = \\varphi(P)$.\n\n* **Injectivity:** If $\\varphi(P)=\\varphi(Q)$, then $(P)-(\\mathcal{O}) \\sim (Q)-(\\mathcal{O})$, hence $(P)-(Q) \\sim 0$. A principal divisor cannot have degree $1$ (a non\u2011constant function on a curve of genus $1$ has at least two poles), so we must have $P=Q$.\n\nTherefore $\\varphi$ is a bijection.\n\n#### 3.3 Group structure on $C$ via $\\varphi$\n\nBecause $\\operatorname{Pic}^0(C)$ is an abelian group, we can transport its structure to $C$ by defining\n\n$$\nP \\oplus Q = \\varphi^{-1}\\big( \\varphi(P) + \\varphi(Q) \\big).\n$$\n\nThen $(C,\\oplus)$ is an abelian group with identity $\\mathcal{O}$ (since $\\varphi(\\mathcal{O})=[0]$) and inverse $\\ominus P = \\varphi^{-1}(-\\varphi(P))$. It is straightforward to check that $\\ominus P$ coincides with the point $-P$ defined in part\u202f2.\n\n#### 3.4 The geometric addition coincides with $\\oplus$\n\nWe now prove that for all $P,Q\\in C$ the geometric sum $P+Q$ equals $P\\oplus Q$. The cases where one of the points is $\\mathcal{O}$ or $Q = -P$ are immediate from the definitions, so we assume $P,Q\\neq\\mathcal{O}$ and $Q\\neq -P$.\n\nLet $L_1$ be the line through $P$ and $Q$ (tangent if $P=Q$), and let $S$ be its third intersection with $C$. By the geometric definition, $P+Q = -S =: R$.\n\nConsider the linear forms:\n\n* $H_1$ \u2013 a homogeneous linear form defining the line $L_1$.\n* $H_2$ \u2013 a homogeneous linear form defining the vertical line through $S$ and $\\mathcal{O}$ (in affine coordinates this is $x - x_S = 0$; in homogeneous coordinates we may take $H_2 = X - x_S Z$).\n\nThe divisor of a linear form $H$ (as a section of the line bundle) is the intersection divisor of the line $H=0$ with $C$. For our curve, the line at infinity $Z=0$ meets $C$ triply at $\\mathcal{O}$, so $(Z) = 3(\\mathcal{O})$. Hence the rational function $H_i/Z$ has divisor\n\n$$\n(H_i/Z) = (H_i) - (Z) = (\\text{intersection divisor of }H_i=0) - 3(\\mathcal{O}).\n$$\n\nThe intersection divisors are:\n\n$$\n(H_1) = (P) + (Q) + (S), \\qquad\n(H_2) = (S) + (R) + (\\mathcal{O}),\n$$\n\nwhere multiplicities are taken into account (e.g., if $P=Q$ the tangent gives $(H_1)=2(P)+(S)$, etc.). Therefore the rational function $f = H_1/H_2$ satisfies\n\n$$\n(f) = (H_1) - (H_2) = (P)+(Q)+(S) - \\big((S)+(R)+(\\mathcal{O})\\big) = (P)+(Q) - (R) - (\\mathcal{O}).\n$$\n\nThus $P+Q - R - \\mathcal{O}$ is principal, i.e.\n\n$$\n(P)-(\\mathcal{O}) + (Q)-(\\mathcal{O}) \\sim (R)-(\\mathcal{O}).\n$$\n\nConsequently $\\varphi(P)+\\varphi(Q) = \\varphi(R)$, so $R = \\varphi^{-1}(\\varphi(P)+\\varphi(Q)) = P\\oplus Q$. Hence $P+Q = P\\oplus Q$.\n\n#### 3.5 Conclusion\n\nSince the geometric addition $+$ coincides with the group operation $\\oplus$ obtained from the abelian group $\\operatorname{Pic}^0(C)$, it inherits all group properties: closure, identity, inverses, commutativity, and associativity. Therefore $(C,+)$ is an abelian group with identity $\\mathcal{O}$. \u220e",

By the geometric definition, \\(P+Q = -S =: R\\).\n\nConsider the linear forms:\n\n* \\(H_1\\) \u2013 a homogeneous linear form defining the line \\(L_1\\).\n* \\(H_2\\) \u2013 a homogeneous linear form defining the vertical line through \\(S\\) and \\(\\mathcal{O}\\) (in affine coordinates this is \\(x - x_S = 0\\); in homogeneous coordinates we may take \\(H_2 = X - x_S Z\\)).\n\nThe divisor of a linear form \\(H\\) (as a section of the line bundle) is the intersection divisor of the line \\(H=0\\) with \\(C\\). For our curve, the line at infinity \\(Z=0\\) meets \\(C\\) triply at \\(\\mathcal{O}\\), so \\((Z) = 3(\\mathcal{O})\\). Hence the rational function \\(H_i/Z\\) has divisor\n\n\\[\n(H_i/Z) = (H_i) - (Z) = (\\text{intersection divisor of }H_i=0) - 3(\\mathcal{O}).\n\\]\n\nThe intersection divisors are:\n\n\\[\n(H_1) = (P) + (Q) + (S), \\qquad\n(H_2) = (S) + (R) + (\\mathcal{O}),\n\\]\n\nwhere multiplicities are taken into account (e.g., if \\(P=Q\\) the tangent gives \\((H_1)=2(P)+(S)\\), etc.). Therefore the rational function \\(f = H_1/H_2\\) satisfies\n\n\\[\n(f) = (H_1) - (H_2) = (P)+(Q)+(S) - \\big((S)+(R)+(\\mathcal{O})\\big) = (P)+(Q) - (R) - (\\mathcal{O}).\n\\]\n\nThus \\(P+Q - R - \\mathcal{O}\\) is principal, i.e.\n\n\\[\n(P)-(\\mathcal{O}) + (Q)-(\\mathcal{O}) \\sim (R)-(\\mathcal{O}).\n\\]\n\nConsequently \\(\\varphi(P)+\\varphi(Q) = \\varphi(R)\\), so \\(R = \\varphi^{-1}(\\varphi(P)+\\varphi(Q)) = P\\oplus Q\\). Hence \\(P+Q = P\\oplus Q\\).\n\n#### 3.5 Conclusion\n\nSince the geometric addition \\(+\\) coincides with the group operation \\(\\oplus\\) obtained from the abelian group \\(\\operatorname{Pic}^0(C)\\), it inherits all group properties: closure, identity, inverses, commutativity, and associativity. Therefore \\((C,+)\\) is an abelian group with identity \\(\\mathcal{O}\\). \u220e",

Consequences of $A^2$ being diagonalizable\n\nLet $J$ be the Jordan form of $A$ (over $\\mathbb{C}$). Then $J^2$ is the Jordan form of $A^2$.  \nFor a Jordan block $J_k(\\lambda)$:\n- If $\\lambda \\neq 0$, then $(J_k(\\lambda))^2$ is similar to $J_k(\\lambda^2)$ because the derivative of $t\\mapsto t^2$ at $\\lambda$ is $2\\lambda \\neq 0$. Hence it is diagonalizable **only if** $k=1$.\n- If $\\lambda = 0$, then $(J_1(0))^2 = 0$ (diagonalizable) and $(J_2(0))^2 = 0$ (diagonalizable), but for $k\\ge 3$, $(J_k(0))^2$ is a non\u2011zero nilpotent matrix, which is not diagonalizable.\n\nSince $\\det A \\neq 0$, no eigenvalue is $0$. Therefore **every Jordan block of $A$ must be of size $1$** for $A^2$ to be diagonalizable. Consequently $A$ is diagonalizable over $\\mathbb{C}$.\n\nThus the only way $A$ can be *not* diagonalizable over $\\mathbb{R}$ while $A^2$ is diagonalizable over $\\mathbb{R}$ is that $A$ has **non\u2011real eigenvalues** (so it cannot be diagonalized over $\\mathbb{R}$) but is diagonalizable over $\\mathbb{C}$ (all Jordan blocks are $1\\times1$). Moreover, the non\u2011real eigenvalues must be such that $A^2$ becomes diagonalizable over $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Structure of eigenvalues\n\nLet the eigenvalues be $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $a\\pm ib$ with $b>0$. Then\n$$\n\\operatorname{tr} A = c + 2a = 6, \\qquad \\det A = c\\,(a^2+b^2) = 8.\n$$\n\nThe real Jordan block for the pair $a\\pm ib$ is\n$$\nR = \\begin{pmatrix} a & -b \\\\ b & a \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nIn the basis giving the real Jordan form, $A$ is block\u2011diagonal $\\operatorname{diag}(c, R)$. Then\n$$\nA^2 \\sim \\operatorname{diag}(c^2,\\; R^2), \\qquad \nR^2 = \\begin{pmatrix} a^2-b^2 & -2ab \\\\ 2ab & a^2-b^2 \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\n\nFor $A^2$ to be diagonalizable over $\\mathbb{R}$, the block $R^2$ must be diagonalizable over $\\mathbb{R}$. The eigenvalues of $R^2$ are $(a\\pm ib)^2 = a^2-b^2 \\pm 2iab$.  \nA real $2\\times2$ matrix with non\u2011real eigenvalues is **not** diagonalizable over $\\mathbb{R}$. Hence we need the eigenvalues of $R^2$ to be real, i.e. $2ab=0$. Since $b\\neq0$ (otherwise the eigenvalues would be real), we must have $a=0$.\n\nWith $a=0$, $R = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -b \\\\ b & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $R^2 = -b^2 I$, which is diagonal (in fact a scalar matrix), hence certainly diagonalizable over $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nNow the trace and determinant conditions become\n$$\nc = 6 \\quad (\\text{from } c+2\\cdot0 = 6),\\qquad \nc\\,b^2 = 6\\,b^2 = 8 \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; b^2 = \\frac{8}{6} = \\frac{4}{3},\\; b = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}.\n$$\n\nThus the eigenvalues are uniquely determined (up to the order of the conjugate pair):\n$$\n\\lambda_1 = 6,\\quad \\lambda_2 = i\\,\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}},\\quad \\lambda_3 = -i\\,\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}.\n$$\n\n---\n\n### 4.

Its image is the cyclic subgroup generated by $(a,b)$. Hence $\\operatorname{im}\\alpha_n$ is either trivial (if $(a,b)=(0,0)$) or an infinite cyclic subgroup of $\\mathbb{Z}\\oplus\\mathbb{Z}$. In particular, $\\operatorname{im}\\alpha_n$ **cannot** be the whole $\\mathbb{Z}\\oplus\\mathbb{Z}$ because $\\mathbb{Z}\\oplus\\mathbb{Z}$ is not cyclic.\n\n* The map $\\beta_n : \\mathbb{Z}\\oplus\\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ is given by $\\beta_n(x,y) = cx + dy$ for some integers $c,d$. Its image is the subgroup generated by $\\gcd(c,d)$ if $(c,d)\\neq(0,0)$, otherwise $0$. As a subset of $\\mathbb{Z}$, $\\operatorname{im}\\beta_n$ is either $0$ or $g\\mathbb{Z}$ with $g\\ge 1$. When $g=1$ the map is surjective ($\\operatorname{im}\\beta_n = \\mathbb{Z}$); when $g>1$ the image is a proper subgroup of $\\mathbb{Z}$ (isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$ but not equal to $\\mathbb{Z}$).\n\n* The map $\\delta_n : \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ is multiplication by an integer $k$ (i.e., $\\delta_n(z)=kz$). Its kernel is $0$ if $k\\neq 0$, and $\\mathbb{Z}$ if $k=0$.\n\nNow use (3). From $\\operatorname{im}\\beta_n = \\ker\\delta_n$ we see that $\\ker\\delta_n$ must be exactly $0$ or $\\mathbb{Z}$. Therefore $\\operatorname{im}\\beta_n$ must be either $0$ or $\\mathbb{Z}$ **as subsets of $\\mathbb{Z}$**. Consequently $\\beta_n$ cannot have image a proper nontrivial subgroup $g\\mathbb{Z}$ with $g>1$; it must be either the zero map ($\\operatorname{im}\\beta_n=0$) or surjective ($\\operatorname{im}\\beta_n=\\mathbb{Z}$).\n\n* If $\\beta_n = 0$, then $\\ker\\beta_n = \\mathbb{Z}\\oplus\\mathbb{Z}$. Exactness at $H_n(L)$ gives $\\operatorname{im}\\alpha_n = \\mathbb{Z}\\oplus\\mathbb{Z}$. But as argued, $\\operatorname{im}\\alpha_n$ cannot be the whole $\\mathbb{Z}\\oplus\\mathbb{Z}$ because it is cyclic. This contradiction rules out $\\beta_n = 0$.\n\n* Hence $\\beta_n$ must be surjective, and then $\\ker\\delta_n = \\operatorname{im}\\beta_n = \\mathbb{Z}$. The only way for $\\ker\\delta_n$ to be $\\mathbb{Z}$ is that $\\delta_n = 0$ (multiplication by $0$).\n\nThus $\\delta_n$ is the zero homomorphism for every $n$.\n\n(Consistency check: With $\\beta_n$ surjective, $\\ker\\beta_n$ is a rank\u20111 free abelian subgroup of $\\mathbb{Z}\\oplus\\mathbb{Z}$, which is cyclic. This can equal $\\operatorname{im}\\alpha_n$ provided $\\alpha_n$ is injective and its image is exactly that kernel. Moreover, $\\delta_n=0$ gives $\\operatorname{im}\\delta_n = 0$, so $\\ker\\alpha_{n-1}=0$ by exactness, i.e., $\\alpha_{n-1}$ is injective, which is compatible with $\\operatorname{im}\\alpha_{n-1}$ being a cyclic subgroup of $\\mathbb{Z}\\oplus\\mathbb{Z}$. Hence the data are consistent.)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The connecting homomorphism $\\delta_n : H_n(M) \\to H_{n-1}(K)$ is the zero map for all $n$.",

Thus \\(k \\in Z_{n-1}(K)\\).\n\nDefine\n\\[\n\\delta_n([m]) = [k] \\in H_{n-1}(K).\n\\]\n\n**Well\u2011definedness:**\n\n*Independence of the lift \\(l\\).* If \\(l'\\) is another lift of \\(m\\), then \\(\\beta_n(l'-l)=0\\), so \\(l'-l = \\alpha_n(a)\\) for some \\(a \\in K_n\\). Then\n\\[\nd_n^L(l') = d_n^L(l) + d_n^L(\\alpha_n(a)) = d_n^L(l) + \\alpha_{n-1}(d_n^K(a)).\n\\]\nThe element \\(k'\\) satisfying \\(\\alpha_{n-1}(k') = d_n^L(l')\\) is therefore \\(k' = k + d_n^K(a)\\). Hence \\([k'] = [k]\\) in homology.\n\n*Independence of the representative \\(m\\).* If \\(m' = m + d_{n+1}^M(m'')\\) is another representative of the same class, choose a lift \\(l''\\) of \\(m''\\) and set \\(\\tilde l = l + d_{n+1}^L(l'')\\). Then \\(\\beta_n(\\tilde l) = m + d_{n+1}^M(\\beta_{n+1}(l'')) = m'\\). The construction with \\(\\tilde l\\) gives a \\(k\\) that differs from the original by a boundary (a similar computation), so the homology class is unchanged.\n\nThus \\(\\delta_n\\) is a well\u2011defined homomorphism.\n\n### Exactness of the long sequence\n\nWe now prove that the sequence\n\n\\[\n\\cdots \\to H_n(K) \\xrightarrow{\\alpha_*} H_n(L) \\xrightarrow{\\beta_*} H_n(M) \\xrightarrow{\\delta_n} H_{n-1}(K) \\xrightarrow{\\alpha_*} H_{n-1}(L) \\to \\cdots\n\\]\n\nis exact, where \\(\\alpha_*\\) and \\(\\beta_*\\) are induced by the chain maps.\n\n#### (a) Exactness at \\(H_n(L)\\)\n\n\\(\\operatorname{im}\\alpha_* \\subseteq \\ker\\beta_*\\): For \\([k] \\in H_n(K)\\), \\(\\beta_*(\\alpha_*([k])) = [\\beta_n(\\alpha_n(k))] = [0] = 0\\).\n\n\\(\\ker\\beta_* \\subseteq \\operatorname{im}\\alpha_*\\): Let \\([l] \\in H_n(L)\\) with \\(\\beta_*([l]) = 0\\), i.e. \\(\\beta_n(l) = d_{n+1}^M(m)\\) for some \\(m \\in M_{n+1}\\).

Write \\(l - d_{n+1}^L(x) = \\alpha_n(k)\\) for some \\(k \\in K_n\\). One checks that \\(k\\) is a cycle:\n\\[\n\\alpha_{n-1}(d_n^K(k)) = d_n^L(\\alpha_n(k)) = d_n^L(l - d_{n+1}^L(x)) = d_n^L(l) - 0 = 0,\n\\]\nand \\(\\alpha_{n-1}\\) monic gives \\(d_n^K(k)=0\\). Hence \\([k] \\in H_n(K)\\). Moreover,\n\\[\n\\alpha_*([k]) = [\\alpha_n(k)] = [l - d_{n+1}^L(x)] = [l],\n\\]\nso \\([l] \\in \\operatorname{im}\\alpha_*\\).\n\n#### (b) Exactness at \\(H_n(M)\\)\n\n\\(\\operatorname{im}\\beta_* \\subseteq \\ker\\delta_n\\): Let \\([l] \\in H_n(L)\\) and set \\(m = \\beta_n(l)\\). Using \\(l\\) itself as a lift in the definition of \\(\\delta_n\\), we have \\(\\alpha_{n-1}(k)=d_n^L(l)\\). Because \\(l\\) is a cycle, \\(d_n^L(l)=0\\), so \\(k=0\\) and \\(\\delta_n([m])=0\\).\n\n\\(\\ker\\delta_n \\subseteq \\operatorname{im}\\beta_*\\): Suppose \\([m] \\in H_n(M)\\) with \\(\\delta_n([m])=0\\). Choose a lift \\(l \\in L_n\\) of \\(m\\) and let \\(k \\in K_{n-1}\\) be the unique element with \\(\\alpha_{n-1}(k)=d_n^L(l)\\). The condition \\(\\delta_n([m])=[k]=0\\) means \\(k = d_n^K(k')\\) for some \\(k' \\in K_n\\). Consider \\(l' = l - \\alpha_n(k')\\). Then\n\\[\nd_n^L(l') = d_n^L(l) - \\alpha_{n-1}(d_n^K(k')) = d_n^L(l) - \\alpha_{n-1}(k) = 0,\n\\]\nso \\(l'\\) is a cycle, and \\(\\beta_n(l') = \\beta_n(l) = m\\). Hence \\([m] = \\beta_*([l'])\\) lies in \\(\\operatorname{im}\\beta_*\\).\n\n#### (c) Exactness at \\(H_{n-1}(K)\\)\n\n\\(\\operatorname{im}\\delta_n \\subseteq \\ker\\alpha_*\\): For \\([m] \\in H_n(M)\\) with \\(\\delta_n([m]) = [k]\\), we have \\(\\alpha_{n-1}(k) = d_n^L(l)\\) for some lift \\(l\\). Then \\(\\alpha_*([k]) = [\\alpha_{n-1}(k)] = [d_n^L(l)] = 0\\) in \\(H_{n-1}(L)\\).\n\n\\(\\ker\\alpha_* \\subseteq \\operatorname{im}\\delta_n\\): Let \\([k] \\in H_{n-1}(K)\\) satisfy \\(\\alpha_*([k]) = 0\\), i.e. \\(\\alpha_{n-1}(k) = d_n^L(l_0)\\) for some \\(l_0 \\in L_n\\). Set \\(m = \\beta_n(l_0)\\). Then\n\\[\nd_n^M(m) = \\beta_{n-1}(d_n^L(l_0)) = \\beta_{n-1}(\\alpha_{n-1}(k)) = 0,\n\\]\nso \\(m\\) is a cycle. Using \\(l_0\\) as a lift, the construction of \\(\\delta_n\\) gives exactly \\(k\\) (or a homologous element), hence \\(\\delta_n([m]) = [k]\\). Thus \\([k] \\in \\operatorname{im}\\delta_n\\).\n\nThis completes the proof that the long sequence in homology is exact.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Determination of the connecting homomorphism \\(\\delta_n\\)\n\nWe are given that for all \\(n\\),\n\\[\nH_n(K) \\cong \\mathbb{Z},\\qquad H_n(L) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}\\oplus\\mathbb{Z},\\qquad H_n(M) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}.\n\\]\nWe identify these groups with \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) and \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\oplus\\mathbb{Z}\\) (the isomorphisms are not needed explicitly; only the abstract structure matters). The long exact sequence becomes\n\n\\[\n\\cdots \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{\\alpha_n} \\mathbb{Z}\\oplus\\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{\\beta_n} \\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{\\delta_n} \\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{\\alpha_{n-1}} \\mathbb{Z}\\oplus\\mathbb{Z} \\to \\cdots\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\alpha_n\\), \\(\\beta_n\\), \\(\\delta_n\\) are group homomorphisms (the connecting map is \\(\\delta_n\\)).\n\nRecall the exactness conditions:\n\\[\n\\operatorname{im}\\alpha_n = \\ker\\beta_n, \\qquad\n\\operatorname{im}\\beta_n = \\ker\\delta_n, \\qquad\n\\operatorname{im}\\delta_n = \\ker\\alpha_{n-1}.\n\\tag{3}\n\\]\n\nWe analyse the possible forms of these maps.\n\n* The map \\(\\alpha_n : \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}\\oplus\\mathbb{Z}\\) is determined by \\(\\alpha_n(1) = (a,b)\\) for some integers \\(a,b\\). Its image is the cyclic subgroup generated by \\((a,b)\\). Hence \\(\\operatorname{im}\\alpha_n\\) is either trivial (if \\((a,b)=(0,0)\\)) or an infinite cyclic subgroup of \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\oplus\\mathbb{Z}\\). In particular, \\(\\operatorname{im}\\alpha_n\\) **cannot** be the whole \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\oplus\\mathbb{Z}\\) because \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\oplus\\mathbb{Z}\\) is not cyclic.\n\n* The map \\(\\beta_n : \\mathbb{Z}\\oplus\\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}\\) is given by \\(\\beta_n(x,y) = cx + dy\\) for some integers \\(c,d\\). Its image is the subgroup generated by \\(\\gcd(c,d)\\) if \\((c,d)\\neq(0,0)\\), otherwise \\(0\\). As a subset of \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\), \\(\\operatorname{im}\\beta_n\\) is either \\(0\\) or \\(g\\mathbb{Z}\\) with \\(g\\ge 1\\). When \\(g=1\\) the map is surjective (\\(\\operatorname{im}\\beta_n = \\mathbb{Z}\\)); when \\(g>1\\) the image is a proper subgroup of \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) (isomorphic to \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) but not equal to \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\)).\n\n* The map \\(\\delta_n : \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}\\) is multiplication by an integer \\(k\\) (i.e., \\(\\delta_n(z)=kz\\)). Its kernel is \\(0\\) if \\(k\\neq 0\\), and \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) if \\(k=0\\).\n\nNow use (3). From \\(\\operatorname{im}\\beta_n = \\ker\\delta_n\\) we see that \\(\\ker\\delta_n\\) must be exactly \\(0\\) or \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\). Therefore \\(\\operatorname{im}\\beta_n\\) must be either \\(0\\) or \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) **as subsets of \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\)**. Consequently \\(\\beta_n\\) cannot have image a proper nontrivial subgroup \\(g\\mathbb{Z}\\) with \\(g>1\\); it must be either the zero map (\\(\\operatorname{im}\\beta_n=0\\)) or surjective (\\(\\operatorname{im}\\beta_n=\\mathbb{Z}\\)).\n\n* If \\(\\beta_n = 0\\), then \\(\\ker\\beta_n = \\mathbb{Z}\\oplus\\mathbb{Z}\\). Exactness at \\(H_n(L)\\) gives \\(\\operatorname{im}\\alpha_n = \\mathbb{Z}\\oplus\\mathbb{Z}\\). But as argued, \\(\\operatorname{im}\\alpha_n\\) cannot be the whole \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\oplus\\mathbb{Z}\\) because it is cyclic. This contradiction rules out \\(\\beta_n = 0\\).\n\n* Hence \\(\\beta_n\\) must be surjective, and then \\(\\ker\\delta_n = \\operatorname{im}\\beta_n = \\mathbb{Z}\\). The only way for \\(\\ker\\delta_n\\) to be \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) is that \\(\\delta_n = 0\\) (multiplication by \\(0\\)).\n\nThus \\(\\delta_n\\) is the zero homomorphism for every \\(n\\).\n\n(Consistency check: With \\(\\beta_n\\) surjective, \\(\\ker\\beta_n\\) is a rank\u20111 free abelian subgroup of \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\oplus\\mathbb{Z}\\), which is cyclic. This can equal \\(\\operatorname{im}\\alpha_n\\) provided \\(\\alpha_n\\) is injective and its image is exactly that kernel. Moreover, \\(\\delta_n=0\\) gives \\(\\operatorname{im}\\delta_n = 0\\), so \\(\\ker\\alpha_{n-1}=0\\) by exactness, i.e., \\(\\alpha_{n-1}\\) is injective, which is compatible with \\(\\operatorname{im}\\alpha_{n-1}\\) being a cyclic subgroup of \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\oplus\\mathbb{Z}\\). Hence the data are consistent.)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The connecting homomorphism \\(\\delta_n : H_n(M) \\to H_{n-1}(K)\\) is the zero map for all \\(n\\).",
