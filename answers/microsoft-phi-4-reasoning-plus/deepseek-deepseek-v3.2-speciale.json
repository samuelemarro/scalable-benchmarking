For $x\\neq 0.5$ we can write  \n$g(x)=x+(x-0.5)\\,\\varphi(x)$ where $\\varphi(x)=\\frac{g(x)-x}{x-0.5}$.  \nThe inequality becomes $|(x-0.5)\\varphi(x)|\\le C|x-0.5|$, i.e., $|\\varphi(x)|\\le C$ for $x\\neq 0.5$.  \nThus $\\varphi$ is a bounded function on $[0,1]\\setminus\\{0.5\\}$ (and can be defined arbitrarily at $0.5$).  \nConversely, if $g(x)=x+(x-0.5)\\varphi(x)$ with $\\varphi$ bounded, then taking $C=\\sup|\\varphi|$ gives $|g(x)-x|\\le C|x-0.5|$.  \nTherefore  \n$$\n[x]=\\bigl\\{\\, g:[0,1]\\to\\mathbb R \\;\\big|\\; g(x)=x+(x-0.5)\\varphi(x),\\ \\varphi\\text{ bounded}\\,\\bigr\\}.\n$$\n\n---\n\n**3.

Define a linear map  \n$$\n\\Phi:V\\longrightarrow \\mathbb R\\times (V/B)\n$$\nas follows. For $f\\in V$, set $a=f(0.5)$.

Hence $\\Phi(f+g)=(a+b,[h_f+h_g])=(a,[h_f])+(b,[h_g])$. Scalar multiplication is similar.  \n- **Kernel:** $f\\in\\ker\\Phi$ iff $a=0$ and $[h_f]=0$, i.e., $h_f$ is bounded. $a=0$ means $f(0.5)=0$. Boundedness of $h_f$ means there exists $M\\ge0$ with $|h_f(x)|\\le M$ for all $x\\neq0.5$, i.e., $|f(x)|\\le M|x-0.5|$ for all $x$. This is exactly $f\\in N$. Conversely, if $f\\in N$, then $|f(x)|\\le C|x-0.5|$ for some $C$, so $f(0.5)=0$ and $|h_f(x)|\\le C$, hence $h_f$ bounded. Thus $\\ker\\Phi=N$.  \n- **Surjectivity:** Given $(a,[h])\\in\\mathbb R\\times(V/B)$, pick any representative $\\tilde h\\in V$ of the coset $[h]$ and define $f(x)=a+(x-0.5)\\tilde h(x)$.
