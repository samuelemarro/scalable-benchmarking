        "answer": "**1. Proving $\\sim$ is an Equivalence Relation:**\n\nTo show that $\\sim$ is an equivalence relation on $S$, we need to prove three properties: reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity.\n\n- **Reflexivity:** For any function $f \\in S$, we need to show that $f \\sim f$. This means we need to find a constant $C$ such that $|f(x) - f(x)| \\leq C \\cdot |x - 0.5|$ for all $x \\in [0, 1]$. Since $|f(x) - f(x)| = 0$ for all $x$, we can choose $C = 0$ which satisfies the condition. Therefore, $f \\sim f$.\n\n- **Symmetry:** For any functions $f, g \\in S$, if $f \\sim g$, then we need to show that $g \\sim f$. If $f \\sim g$, there exists a constant $C$ such that $|f(x) - g(x)| \\leq C \\cdot |x - 0.5|$ for all $x \\in [0, 1]$. Since absolute values are symmetric, we have $|g(x) - f(x)| = |f(x) - g(x)| \\leq C \\cdot |x - 0.5|$, which means $g \\sim f$.\n\n- **Transitivity:** For any functions $f, g, h \\in S$, if $f \\sim g$ and $g \\sim h$, then we need to show that $f \\sim h$. If $f \\sim g$, there exists a constant $C_1$ such that $|f(x) - g(x)| \\leq C_1 \\cdot |x - 0.5|$ for all $x \\in [0, 1]$. Similarly, if $g \\sim h$, there exists a constant $C_2$ such that $|g(x) - h(x)| \\leq C_2 \\cdot |x - 0.5|$ for all $x \\in [0, 1]$. By the triangle inequality, we have:\n\n$|f(x) - h(x)| \\leq |f(x) - g(x)| + |g(x) - h(x)| \\leq (C_1 + C_2) \\cdot |x - 0.5|$\n\nThus, $f \\sim h$.\n\nSince we have shown reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity, the relation $\\sim$ is indeed an equivalence relation on $S$.\n\n**2. Equivalence Class of $f(x) = x$:**\n\nTo determine the equivalence class of $f(x) = x$ under this relation, we need to find all functions $g(x)$ such that $f \\sim g$, i.e., there exists a constant $C$ such that $|f(x) - g(x)| \\leq C \\cdot |x - 0.5|$ for all $x \\in [0, 1]$.\n\nGiven $f(x) = x$, we can see that any function $g(x)$ that satisfies $|x - g(x)| \\leq C \\cdot |x - 0.5|$ for all $x \\in [0, 1]$ will be in the equivalence class of $f(x) = x$. This implies that $g(x)$ must be of the form $g(x) = x + k(x - 0.5)$ where $k$ is a constant.\n\nTherefore, the equivalence class of $f(x) = x$ is the set of functions of the form $g(x) = x + k(x - 0.5)$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**3. Vector Space Structure of Equivalence Classes:**\n\nTo show that the set of equivalence classes forms a vector space over the reals, we need to define vector addition and scalar multiplication on these equivalence classes.\n\n- **Vector Addition:** Given two equivalence classes $[f]$ and $[g]$, we define their sum as $[f] + [g] = [f + g]$, where $(f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)$. This operation is well-defined since if $f \\sim f'$ and $g \\sim g'$, then $f + g \\sim f' + g'$.\n\n- **Scalar Multiplication:** Given an equivalence class $[f]$ and a scalar $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we define scalar multiplication as $\\alpha [f] = [\\alpha f]$, where $(\\alpha f)(x) = \\alpha f(x)$. This operation is well-defined since if $f \\sim f'$, then $\\alpha f \\sim \\alpha f'$.\n\nWith these operations, the set of equivalence classes forms a vector space over the reals.\n\n**Basis for the Vector Space:**\n\nTo identify a basis for this vector space, we can consider the equivalence classes of functions of the form $x^n$ for $n \\geq 0$. These equivalence classes are linearly independent and span the vector space of equivalence classes. Therefore, the set $\\{[x^n] \\mid n \\geq 0\\}$ forms a basis for this vector space.",

        "answer": "**Solution:**\n\nLet's analyze the function $f(x)$ for a given $x \\in S$. The function $f(x)$ counts the number of elements in $S$ that are divisible by $x$. Since the elements of $S$ are distinct positive integers, $x$ itself is always divisible by $x$, so $f(x) \\geq 1$ for all $x \\in S$.\n\nNow, let's consider the sum $\\sum_{x \\in S} f(x)$. This sum is the total count of elements in $S$ that are divisible by some $x \\in S$. To maximize this sum, we want to maximize the number of elements that are divisible by each $x \\in S$.\n\nTo achieve this maximum, we need to choose $S$ such that each element $x \\in S$ is a prime number. This is because a prime number has only two divisors: 1 and itself. Therefore, for a prime number $x$, $f(x) = 2$ (since $x$ and 1 are the only elements divisible by $x$ in $S$).\n\nGiven that $S$ consists of $n$ distinct positive integers, we can choose the first $n$ prime numbers as the elements of $S$. The sum $\\sum_{x \\in S} f(x)$ for this choice of $S$ will be:\n\n$$\\sum_{x \\in S} f(x) = 2n$$\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible value of $\\sum_{x \\in S} f(x)$ for a given $n$ is $\\boxed{2n}$ when $S$ consists of the first $n$ prime numbers.",
