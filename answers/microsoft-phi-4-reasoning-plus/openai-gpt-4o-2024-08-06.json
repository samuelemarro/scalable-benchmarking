        "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to address each part of the question systematically.\n\n### Part 1: Prove that $\\sim$ is an equivalence relation on $S$.\n\nAn equivalence relation must satisfy three properties: reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity.\n\n1. **Reflexivity**: For any function $f \\in S$, we need to show that $f \\sim f$. This means there exists a constant $C$ such that for all $x \\in [0, 1]$, $|f(x) - f(x)| \\leq C \\cdot |x - 0.5|$. Since $|f(x) - f(x)| = 0$ for all $x$, we can choose $C = 0$. Thus, reflexivity holds.\n\n2. **Symmetry**: For any functions $f, g \\in S$, if $f \\sim g$, then $g \\sim f$. By definition, $f \\sim g$ means there exists a constant $C$ such that for all $x \\in [0, 1]$, $|f(x) - g(x)| \\leq C \\cdot |x - 0.5|$. This implies $|g(x) - f(x)| = |f(x) - g(x)| \\leq C \\cdot |x - 0.5|$. Thus, $g \\sim f$, and symmetry holds.\n\n3. **Transitivity**: For any functions $f, g, h \\in S$, if $f \\sim g$ and $g \\sim h$, then $f \\sim h$. Assume $f \\sim g$ with constant $C_1$ and $g \\sim h$ with constant $C_2$. Then for all $x \\in [0, 1]$, we have $|f(x) - g(x)| \\leq C_1 \\cdot |x - 0.5|$ and $|g(x) - h(x)| \\leq C_2 \\cdot |x - 0.5|$. By the triangle inequality, $|f(x) - h(x)| \\leq |f(x) - g(x)| + |g(x) - h(x)| \\leq (C_1 + C_2) \\cdot |x - 0.5|$. Thus, $f \\sim h$ with constant $C = C_1 + C_2$, and transitivity holds.\n\nSince $\\sim$ satisfies reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity, it is an equivalence relation on $S$.\n\n### Part 2: Determine the equivalence class of the function $f(x) = x$.\n\nThe equivalence class of $f(x) = x$ consists of all functions $g \\in S$ such that $f \\sim g$. This means there exists a constant $C$ such that for all $x \\in [0, 1]$, $|x - g(x)| \\leq C \\cdot |x - 0.5|$. \n\nTo find the form of such functions $g(x)$, consider the condition $|x - g(x)| \\leq C \\cdot |x - 0.5|$. This implies that $g(x)$ can be expressed as $g(x) = x + h(x)$, where $|h(x)| \\leq C \\cdot |x - 0.5|$. \n\nThus, the equivalence class of $f(x) = x$ is the set of functions of the form $g(x) = x + h(x)$, where $h(x)$ satisfies $|h(x)| \\leq C \\cdot |x - 0.5|$ for some constant $C$.\n\n### Part 3: Show that the set of equivalence classes forms a vector space over the reals. Identify a basis for this vector space.\n\nTo show that the set of equivalence classes forms a vector space, we need to verify the vector space axioms. Consider two equivalence classes $[f]$ and $[g]$, and a scalar $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n1. **Addition**: Define $[f] + [g] = [f + g]$. We need to show this is well-defined. If $f \\sim f'$ and $g \\sim g'$, then $|f(x) - f'(x)| \\leq C_1 \\cdot |x - 0.5|$ and $|g(x) - g'(x)| \\leq C_2 \\cdot |x - 0.5|$. Thus, $|(f+g)(x) - (f'+g')(x)| \\leq (C_1 + C_2) \\cdot |x - 0.5|$, so $f + g \\sim f' + g'$. Therefore, addition is well-defined.\n\n2. **Scalar Multiplication**: Define $\\alpha [f] = [\\alpha f]$. We need to show this is well-defined. If $f \\sim f'$, then $|f(x) - f'(x)| \\leq C \\cdot |x - 0.5|$. Thus, $|\\alpha f(x) - \\alpha f'(x)| = |\\alpha| \\cdot |f(x) - f'(x)| \\leq |\\alpha| C \\cdot |x - 0.5|$, so $\\alpha f \\sim \\alpha f'$. Therefore, scalar multiplication is well-defined.\n\nThe zero vector is the equivalence class of the zero function $f(x) = 0$, and the additive inverse of $[f]$ is $[-f]$.\n\nTo identify a basis, note that any function $g(x)$ in the equivalence class of $f(x) = x$ can be written as $g(x) = x + h(x)$, where $|h(x)| \\leq C \\cdot |x - 0.5|$. The function $h(x)$ can be any function satisfying this condition, which suggests that the vector space is one-dimensional with a basis consisting of the equivalence class of the function $f(x) = x$ itself.\n\nThus, the set of equivalence classes forms a vector space over the reals, and a basis for this vector space is $\\{ [x] \\}$, where $[x]$ is the equivalence class of the function $f(x) = x$.",

This implies that $h(x)$ must vanish at $x = 0.5$ and be bounded by a linear function of $|x - 0.5|$.
