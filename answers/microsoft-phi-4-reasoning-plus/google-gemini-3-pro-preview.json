        "answer": "Here is the step-by-step solution.\n\n### 1. Proof that $\\sim$ is an equivalence relation\n\nLet $S$ be a set of real-valued functions defined on $[0, 1]$. We assume $S$ is a vector space (i.e., closed under addition and scalar multiplication) so that the later question about forming a vector space is well-posed.\n\nThe relation is defined as: $f \\sim g$ if and only if there exists a constant $C \\geq 0$ such that for all $x \\in [0, 1]$,\n$$|f(x) - g(x)| \\leq C \\cdot |x - 0.5|$$\n\nTo prove $\\sim$ is an equivalence relation, we must show it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.\n\n**Reflexivity:**\nFor any $f \\in S$, consider $|f(x) - f(x)|$.\n$$|f(x) - f(x)| = 0$$\nSince $0 \\leq 1 \\cdot |x - 0.5|$ for all $x$ (or any non-negative $C$), the condition holds with $C=1$ (or $C=0$). Thus, $f \\sim f$.\n\n**Symmetry:**\nSuppose $f \\sim g$. Then there exists a constant $C$ such that $|f(x) - g(x)| \\leq C |x - 0.5|$ for all $x$.\nSince $|g(x) - f(x)| = |f(x) - g(x)|$, we have:\n$$|g(x) - f(x)| \\leq C |x - 0.5|$$\nThus, $g \\sim f$.\n\n**Transitivity:**\nSuppose $f \\sim g$ and $g \\sim h$.\nThen there exists $C_1$ such that $|f(x) - g(x)| \\leq C_1 |x - 0.5|$.\nAnd there exists $C_2$ such that $|g(x) - h(x)| \\leq C_2 |x - 0.5|$.\nBy the Triangle Inequality:\n$$|f(x) - h(x)| = |(f(x) - g(x)) + (g(x) - h(x))| \\leq |f(x) - g(x)| + |g(x) - h(x)|$$\nSubstituting the inequalities:\n$$|f(x) - h(x)| \\leq C_1 |x - 0.5| + C_2 |x - 0.5| = (C_1 + C_2) |x - 0.5|$$\nLet $C = C_1 + C_2$. Then $|f(x) - h(x)| \\leq C |x - 0.5|$ for all $x$.\nThus, $f \\sim h$.\n\n**Conclusion:** The relation $\\sim$ is an equivalence relation.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Equivalence class of the function $f(x) = x$\n\nLet $f(x) = x$. We want to find the set $[f] = \\{g \\in S \\mid g \\sim f\\}$.\nFirst, let's test if $f$ is equivalent to a constant function. Consider the constant function $k(x) = 0.5$.\n$$|f(x) - k(x)| = |x - 0.5|$$\nThe condition for $f \\sim k$ is $|x - 0.5| \\leq C |x - 0.5|$. This holds true for $C = 1$.\nTherefore, $x \\sim 0.5$.\n\nSince $\\sim$ is an equivalence relation, the equivalence class of $x$ is the same as the equivalence class of the constant function $0.5$.\n$$[x] = [0.5]$$\n\nA function $g$ is in this class if and only if $g \\sim 0.5$, which means:\n$$|g(x) - 0.5| \\leq C |x - 0.5|$$\nThis inequality implies two things:\n1.  At $x = 0.5$, $|g(0.5) - 0.5| \\leq C \\cdot 0 = 0 \\implies g(0.5) = 0.5$.\n2.  For $x \\neq 0.5$, $\\left| \\frac{g(x) - g(0.5)}{x - 0.5} \\right| \\leq C$. This means the difference quotient of $g$ at $0.5$ is bounded on the interval $[0, 1]$. This is the definition of $g$ being **Lipschitz continuous at $x = 0.5$**.\n\n**Answer:** The equivalence class of $f(x) = x$ is the set of all functions $g \\in S$ such that $g(0.5) = 0.5$ and $g$ is Lipschitz continuous at $0.5$.\n$$[x] = \\{ g \\in S \\mid \\exists C \\in \\mathbb{R}, \\forall t \\in [0, 1], |g(t) - 0.5| \\leq C |t - 0.5| \\}$$\n\n---\n\n### 3. Vector space structure and basis\n\n**Vector Space Structure:**\nLet $V = S / \\sim$ be the set of equivalence classes. We define addition and scalar multiplication on classes via representatives:\n*   $[f] + [g] = [f + g]$\n*   $\\alpha [f] = [\\alpha f]$\n\nWe must ensure these are well-defined.\nSuppose $f \\sim f'$ and $g \\sim g'$.\n$|(f+g) - (f'+g')| \\leq |f-f'| + |g-g'| \\leq C_1|x-0.5| + C_2|x-0.5| = (C_1+C_2)|x-0.5|$.\nSo $(f+g) \\sim (f'+g')$. Addition is well-defined.\nSimilarly, $|\\alpha f - \\alpha f'| = |\\alpha| |f-f'| \\leq |\\alpha| C |x-0.5|$.\nSo $\\alpha f \\sim \\alpha f'$. Scalar multiplication is well-defined.\nSince $S$ is a vector space, $V$ inherits the vector space axioms (associativity, distributivity, etc.). The zero vector is the class of the zero function $[0]$.\n\n**Identifying a Basis:**\nTo identify a basis, we analyze the structure of the classes.\nDefine a map $L: V \\to \\mathbb{R}$ by $L([f]) = f(0.5)$.\n*   **Well-defined:** If $f \\sim g$, then $|f(x) - g(x)| \\leq C|x-0.5|$. At $x=0.5$, this gives $|f(0.5) - g(0.5)| \\leq 0$, so $f(0.5) = g(0.5)$. Thus $L$ depends only on the class.\n*   **Linear:** $L([f] + [g]) = (f+g)(0.5) = f(0.5) + g(0.5) = L([f]) + L([g])$. Similarly for scalars.\n*   **Surjective:** Assuming $S$ contains all constant functions, for any $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the constant function $h(x) = y$ is in $S$ and $L([h]) = y$.\n\nNow consider the kernel of $L$:\n$\\text{Ker}(L) = \\{ [f] \\in V \\mid f(0.5) = 0 \\}$.\nFor $[f]$ to be the zero vector in $V$ (i.e., $[f] = [0]$), we need $f \\sim 0$, which means $|f(x)| \\leq C|x-0.5|$.\nThis condition is exactly that $f(0.5) = 0$ **and** $f$ is Lipschitz at $0.5$.\n\n**Assumption on $S$:**\nIn standard calculus and analysis contexts (e.g., if $S$ is the set of polynomials, $C^1$ functions, or Lipschitz functions), every function $f \\in S$ is Lipschitz at $x=0.5$.\nUnder this assumption:\nIf $f(0.5) = 0$, then $f$ is automatically Lipschitz at $0.5$ (since $f \\in S$), so $|f(x)| \\leq C|x-0.5|$ holds for some $C$.\nTherefore, $f(0.5) = 0 \\implies [f] = [0]$.\nThis implies $\\text{Ker}(L) = \\{ [0] \\}$.\n\nSince $L$ is a linear bijection (isomorphism) between $V$ and $\\mathbb{R}$, the vector space $V$ is **1-dimensional**.\n\n**Basis:**\nSince the space is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$, any non-zero vector forms a basis. The simplest choice is the class of the constant function $1$.\nLet $e(x) = 1$. Then $L([e]) = 1 \\neq 0$.\n\n**Final Answer for Basis:**\nA basis for the vector space is the set containing the equivalence class of the constant function $1$:\n$$\\mathcal{B} = \\{ [1] \\}$$\n*(Note: The class $[x]$ found in part 2 is $[0.5] = 0.5 [1]$, which is also a valid basis vector).*",

        "answer": "To find the maximum possible value of the sum $\\sum_{x \\in S} f(x)$, let us analyze the definition of the function and the properties of the set $S$.\n\n**1. Understanding the Sum**\n\nLet $S = \\{x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n\\}$ be a set of $n$ distinct positive integers.\nThe function $f(x)$ is defined as the number of elements in $S$ that are divisible by $x$. We can express $f(x)$ using the indicator function:\n$$ f(x) = \\sum_{y \\in S} \\mathbb{1}_{x|y} $$\nwhere $\\mathbb{1}_{x|y}$ is equal to $1$ if $x$ divides $y$ (denoted as $x|y$), and $0$ otherwise.\n\nWe want to maximize the total sum $F(S)$:\n$$ F(S) = \\sum_{x \\in S} f(x) = \\sum_{x \\in S} \\sum_{y \\in S} \\mathbb{1}_{x|y} $$\nThis sum counts the total number of ordered pairs $(x, y) \\in S \\times S$ such that $x$ divides $y$.\n\n**2. Properties of the Divisibility Relation**\n\nThe relation \"divides\" ($|$) on the set of positive integers is a **partial order**. Specifically, for any $x, y, z \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$:\n- **Reflexivity:** $x|x$ is always true.\n- **Antisymmetry:** If $x|y$ and $y|x$, then $x=y$. Since all elements in $S$ are distinct, if $x \\neq y$, it is impossible for both $x|y$ and $y|x$ to hold.\n- **Transitivity:** If $x|y$ and $y|z$, then $x|z$.\n\nBecause $S$ consists of distinct positive integers, the divisibility relation on $S$ forms a partially ordered set (poset).\n\n**3. Maximizing the Number of Pairs**\n\nWe are looking for the maximum number of pairs $(x, y)$ in $S \\times S$ such that $x|y$.\nIn any partial order on a set of size $n$:\n- For every element $x$, the pair $(x, x)$ is included (reflexivity). This contributes $n$ pairs.\n- For any pair of distinct elements $\\{x, y\\}$, at most one of the relations $x|y$ or $y|x$ can hold (antisymmetry).\n\nTo maximize the number of pairs, we want every pair of distinct elements to be comparable. That is, for every distinct $x, y \\in S$, either $x|y$ or $y|x$ should be true. A partial order where every pair of elements is comparable is called a **total order** or a **chain**.\n\nIf $S$ forms a chain $x_1 | x_2 | \\dots | x_n$, then for any $i, j \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, $x_i | x_j$ if and only if $i \\le j$.\nThe number of such pairs is the number of pairs $(i, j)$ with $1 \\le i \\le j \\le n$.\nThis count is:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^n (n - i + 1) = n + (n-1) + \\dots + 1 = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} $$\nAlternatively, we can sum the number of distinct pairs plus the reflexive pairs:\n$$ \\binom{n}{2} + n = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} + n = \\frac{n^2 - n + 2n}{2} = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} $$\n\n**4. Constructing the Optimal Set**\n\nWe must ensure that there exists a set $S$ of $n$ distinct positive integers that forms a divisibility chain.\nConsider the set of powers of 2:\n$$ S = \\{2^0, 2^1, 2^2, \\dots, 2^{n-1}\\} = \\{1, 2, 4, \\dots, 2^{n-1}\\} $$\nHere, $x_k = 2^{k-1}$. For any $j > i$, $x_i$ divides $x_j$ (since $2^{j-1} / 2^{i-1} = 2^{j-i}$, which is an integer).\nSince all elements are distinct and positive, this set satisfies the constraints and forms a total order under divisibility.\n\nFor this set:\n- $f(2^0) = n$ (divides all $n$ elements)\n- $f(2^1) = n-1$ (divides $2^1, \\dots, 2^{n-1}$)\n- $\\dots$\n- $f(2^{n-1}) = 1$ (divides only itself)\n\nThe sum is:\n$$ \\sum_{x \\in S} f(x) = n + (n-1) + \\dots + 1 = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} $$\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe maximum value is achieved when the set $S$ forms a divisibility chain. The sum of $f(x)$ corresponds to the number of comparable pairs in the poset, which is maximized at $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe maximum possible value of the sum $\\sum_{x \\in S} f(x)$ is\n$$ \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} $$",
