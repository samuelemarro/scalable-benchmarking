Proof that $S$ contains exactly two elements**\n\nTo determine the size of the set $S = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p \\mid x^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p} \\}$, we must analyze the quadratic congruence $x^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$.\n\n**Step 1: Upper bound on the number of solutions**\nSince $p$ is a prime number, the ring of integers modulo $p$, denoted $\\mathbb{Z}_p$, is a field. The equation $x^2 + 1 = 0$ involves a polynomial $f(x) = x^2 + 1$ of degree 2. A fundamental property of fields is that a non-zero polynomial of degree $n$ has at most $n$ roots. Therefore, the set $S$ contains at most 2 elements.\n\n**Step 2: Existence of solutions**\nWe determine if $-1$ is a quadratic residue modulo $p$ using the Legendre symbol and Euler's Criterion. Euler's Criterion states that for a prime $p$ and an integer $a$:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{a}{p} \\right) \\equiv a^{\\frac{p-1}{2}} \\pmod{p} $$\nApplying this to $a = -1$:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{-1}{p} \\right) \\equiv (-1)^{\\frac{p-1}{2}} \\pmod{p} $$\nThe problem states that $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$. Thus, we can write $p = 4k + 1$ for some integer $k \\geq 1$. Substituting this into the exponent:\n$$ \\frac{p-1}{2} = \\frac{(4k+1)-1}{2} = \\frac{4k}{2} = 2k $$\nSince $2k$ is an even integer, $(-1)^{2k} = 1$. Therefore:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{-1}{p} \\right) = 1 $$\nThis implies that $-1$ is a quadratic residue modulo $p$, so there exists at least one solution $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p$ such that $x_0^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$. Thus, $|S| \\geq 1$.\n\n**Step 3: Exact count of solutions**\nLet $x_0$ be a solution found in Step 2. Then $-x_0$ is also a solution because:\n$$ (-x_0)^2 = (-1)^2 x_0^2 = 1 \\cdot (-1) = -1 \\pmod{p} $$\nWe must verify that $x_0$ and $-x_0$ are distinct elements in $\\mathbb{Z}_p$.\nAssume for contradiction that $x_0 \\equiv -x_0 \\pmod{p}$.\n$$ \\implies 2x_0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p} $$\nSince $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, $p$ is an odd prime ($p \\geq 5$), so $p \\nmid 2$. Thus, $2$ is invertible in $\\mathbb{Z}_p$, implying $x_0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$.\nHowever, $0^2 = 0 \\not\\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$, so $x_0$ cannot be $0$.\nThis contradicts the assumption, so $x_0 \\not\\equiv -x_0 \\pmod{p}$.\n\nSince we have found at least two distinct solutions ($x_0$ and $-x_0$) and we know there are at most two solutions, the set $S$ contains exactly two elements.\n\n***\n\n**2. Explicit determination of the elements**\n\nWe use Wilson's Theorem to construct the solutions explicitly in terms of $p$.\nWilson's Theorem states that for any prime $p$:\n$$ (p-1)! \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p} $$\n\nLet $m = \\frac{p-1}{2}$.

        "raw_answer": "**1. Proof that $S$ contains exactly two elements**\n\nTo determine the size of the set $S = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p \\mid x^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p} \\}$, we must analyze the quadratic congruence $x^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$.\n\n**Step 1: Upper bound on the number of solutions**\nSince $p$ is a prime number, the ring of integers modulo $p$, denoted $\\mathbb{Z}_p$, is a field. The equation $x^2 + 1 = 0$ involves a polynomial $f(x) = x^2 + 1$ of degree 2. A fundamental property of fields is that a non-zero polynomial of degree $n$ has at most $n$ roots. Therefore, the set $S$ contains at most 2 elements.\n\n**Step 2: Existence of solutions**\nWe determine if $-1$ is a quadratic residue modulo $p$ using the Legendre symbol and Euler's Criterion. Euler's Criterion states that for a prime $p$ and an integer $a$:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{a}{p} \\right) \\equiv a^{\\frac{p-1}{2}} \\pmod{p} $$\nApplying this to $a = -1$:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{-1}{p} \\right) \\equiv (-1)^{\\frac{p-1}{2}} \\pmod{p} $$\nThe problem states that $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$. Thus, we can write $p = 4k + 1$ for some integer $k \\geq 1$. Substituting this into the exponent:\n$$ \\frac{p-1}{2} = \\frac{(4k+1)-1}{2} = \\frac{4k}{2} = 2k $$\nSince $2k$ is an even integer, $(-1)^{2k} = 1$. Therefore:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{-1}{p} \\right) = 1 $$\nThis implies that $-1$ is a quadratic residue modulo $p$, so there exists at least one solution $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p$ such that $x_0^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$. Thus, $|S| \\geq 1$.\n\n**Step 3: Exact count of solutions**\nLet $x_0$ be a solution found in Step 2. Then $-x_0$ is also a solution because:\n$$ (-x_0)^2 = (-1)^2 x_0^2 = 1 \\cdot (-1) = -1 \\pmod{p} $$\nWe must verify that $x_0$ and $-x_0$ are distinct elements in $\\mathbb{Z}_p$.\nAssume for contradiction that $x_0 \\equiv -x_0 \\pmod{p}$.\n$$ \\implies 2x_0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p} $$\nSince $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, $p$ is an odd prime ($p \\geq 5$), so $p \\nmid 2$. Thus, $2$ is invertible in $\\mathbb{Z}_p$, implying $x_0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$.\nHowever, $0^2 = 0 \\not\\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$, so $x_0$ cannot be $0$.\nThis contradicts the assumption, so $x_0 \\not\\equiv -x_0 \\pmod{p}$.\n\nSince we have found at least two distinct solutions ($x_0$ and $-x_0$) and we know there are at most two solutions, the set $S$ contains exactly two elements.\n\n***\n\n**2.

For $k=2$, let $p \\leq a \\vee b$. Then $p = p \\wedge (a \\vee b)$. By distributivity, $p = (p \\wedge a) \\vee (p \\wedge b)$. Since $p$ is join-irreducible, either $p = p \\wedge a$ (implying $p \\leq a$) or $p = p \\wedge b$ (implying $p \\leq b$). The inductive step follows easily.\n\n**Part A: Existence**\nLet $x \\in L$. We prove that $x$ is a join of join-irreducibles by induction on the height of $x$ in the lattice.\n-   If $x = 0$, it is the join of the empty set of join-irreducibles.\n-   If $x$ is join-irreducible, then $x = x$ is the expression.\n-   If $x$ is not join-irreducible and $x \\neq 0$, then by definition $x = a \\vee b$ for some strictly smaller elements $a < x$ and $b < x$. By the induction hypothesis, $a$ and $b$ can be expressed as joins of join-irreducible elements. Thus, their join $x = a \\vee b$ is also a join of join-irreducible elements.\nGiven a set of join-irreducibles whose join is $x$, we can remove any element that is less than or equal to another element in the set without changing the join. Repeating this pruning process results in an **irredundant** set (an antichain) of join-irreducibles.\n\n**Part B: Uniqueness**\nSuppose an element $x$ has two irredundant representations:\n$$ x = \\bigvee A = \\bigvee B $$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are antichains of join-irreducible elements.\n\n1.

        "answer": "Here is the complete solution to the problem regarding the elliptic curve $C$.\n\n### 1. Definition of the Group Law and Addition of Points\n\nTo define the group law on the curve $C$, we must view $C$ in the projective plane $\\mathbb{P}^2(\\mathbb{C})$. The homogeneous equation is $Y^2Z = X^3 + aXZ^2 + bZ^3$. The given affine equation $y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$ corresponds to the chart $Z=1$. The point at infinity, denoted as $\\mathcal{O} = [0:1:0]$, is the unique point on the line at infinity $Z=0$ and serves as the identity element of the group.\n\n**Geometric Definition (Chord-and-Tangent Method):**\nLet $P$ and $Q$ be two points on $C$. The sum $P + Q$ is defined by the following geometric construction:\n1.  Draw the line $L$ connecting $P$ and $Q$. (If $P=Q$, let $L$ be the tangent line to $C$ at $P$).\n2.  By B\u00e9zout's Theorem, the line $L$ intersects the cubic curve $C$ at exactly three points (counting multiplicity). Let the third point of intersection be $R$.\n3.  Draw the vertical line through $R$ and $\\mathcal{O}$. This line intersects the curve at $R$, $\\mathcal{O}$, and a third point. This third point is defined as the sum $P+Q$.\n    *   Geometrically, since the curve is symmetric about the x-axis, $P+Q$ is the reflection of $R$ across the x-axis.\n\n**Algebraic Formulation:**\nLet $P = (x_1, y_1)$ and $Q = (x_2, y_2)$. We seek the coordinates $(x_3, y_3)$ of $P+Q$.\n\n*Case 1: $P = -Q$* (i.e., $x_1 = x_2$ and $y_1 = -y_2$).\nIn this case, the line through $P$ and $Q$ is vertical. It intersects $\\mathcal{O}$ at the point at infinity. Thus, $P + (-P) = \\mathcal{O}$.\n\n*Case 2: $P \\neq -Q$.*\nFirst, we calculate the slope $\\lambda$ of the line $L$ passing through $P$ and $Q$.\n*   If $P \\neq Q$ (Addition):\n    $$ \\lambda = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} $$\n*   If $P = Q$ (Doubling):\n    Differentiating $y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$ implicitly gives $2y y' = 3x^2 + a$. Thus, the slope of the tangent is:\n    $$ \\lambda = \\frac{3x_1^2 + a}{2y_1} $$\n    (Note: The denominator is non-zero because $y_1 \\neq 0$ is given, and if $y_1=0$, $P=-P$ which is Case 1).\n\nThe line $L$ has the equation $y = \\lambda(x - x_1) + y_1$. To find the intersection with the curve, substitute this into the curve equation:\n$$ (\\lambda(x - x_1) + y_1)^2 = x^3 + ax + b $$\n$$ \\lambda^2(x^2 - 2x_1x + x_1^2) + \\dots = x^3 + ax + b $$\nRearranging to a monic polynomial in $x$:\n$$ x^3 - \\lambda^2 x^2 + \\dots = 0 $$\nAccording to Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of this cubic equation ($x_1, x_2, x_R$) is equal to the coefficient of $x^2$. Thus:\n$$ x_1 + x_2 + x_R = \\lambda^2 \\implies x_R = \\lambda^2 - x_1 - x_2 $$\nThe y-coordinate of the third intersection point $R$ is $y_R = \\lambda(x_R - x_1) + y_1$.\nThe sum $P+Q$ is the reflection of $R$ across the x-axis. Therefore, the coordinates $(x_3, y_3)$ of $P+Q$ are:\n$$ x_3 = \\lambda^2 - x_1 - x_2 $$\n$$ y_3 = -y_R = \\lambda(x_1 - x_3) - y_1 $$\n\n***\n\n### 2. Coordinates of $-P$\n\nWe are given $P = (x_1, y_1)$ with $y_1 \\neq 0$. The inverse $-P$ is defined as the element such that $P + (-P) = \\mathcal{O}$.\n\n**Geometric Construction:**\nGeometrically, the inverse of a point $P$ is found by intersecting the line connecting $P$ and $\\mathcal{O}$ with the curve. Since $\\mathcal{O}$ is the point at infinity in the vertical direction (projective coordinates $[0:1:0]$), the line connecting $P$ and $\\mathcal{O}$ is the vertical line $x = x_1$.\n\n**Calculation:**\nWe substitute $x = x_1$ into the curve equation $y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$:\n$$ y^2 = x_1^3 + ax_1 + b $$\nSince $P=(x_1, y_1)$ is on the curve, we know $x_1^3 + ax_1 + b = y_1^2$.\nThus, $y^2 = y_1^2$, which implies $y = y_1$ or $y = -y_1$.\n\nThe intersection points of the vertical line $x = x_1$ with $C$ are $P(x_1, y_1)$, the point $\\mathcal{O}$ (at infinity), and the point $(x_1, -y_1)$. By the definition of the group law, the three points on a line sum to $\\mathcal{O}$.\n$$ P + (x_1, -y_1) + \\mathcal{O} = \\mathcal{O} $$\nSince $\\mathcal{O}$ is the identity:\n$$ P + (x_1, -y_1) = \\mathcal{O} $$\nThus:\n$$ -P = (x_1, -y_1) $$\n\n***\n\n### 3. Proof that Points on $C$ Form an Abelian Group\n\nLet $E(\\mathbb{C})$ be the set of points on the curve including $\\mathcal{O}$. We prove that $(E(\\mathbb{C}), +)$ is an abelian group.\n\n**1. Closure**\nUsing the algebraic formulas derived in Part 1, the coordinates of $P+Q$ are rational functions of the coordinates of $P$ and $Q$. Since the field is $\\mathbb{C}$, these operations are well-defined provided the denominators are non-zero. The only denominators are $x_2 - x_1$ (zero only if $P, Q$ on same vertical line) and $2y_1$ (zero only if $P$ has order 2). These edge cases are handled by the geometric definitions (vertical line case yields $\\mathcal{O}$, tangent at $y=0$ corresponds to vertical tangent/point at infinity). Thus, adding two points in $E(\\mathbb{C})$ always results in a unique point in $E(\\mathbb{C})$.\n\n**2. Identity Element**\nWe assert that $\\mathcal{O}$ is the identity.\nConsider $P + \\mathcal{O}$.\nThe line through $P$ and $\\mathcal{O}$ is the vertical line through $P$. As shown in Part 2, this line intersects $C$ at $P$, $\\mathcal{O}$, and $-P$.\nLet the third intersection point be $R = -P$.\nThe sum $P + \\mathcal{O}$ is defined as the reflection of $R$ (inverse of $-P$).\nSince $-(-P) = P$ (reflection of a reflection returns to the original), $P + \\mathcal{O} = P$.\nThus, $\\mathcal{O}$ is the identity.\n\n**3. Inverse Element**\nFor every $P = (x_1, y_1)$, we identified $-P = (x_1, -y_1)$ in Part 2.\nThe line through $P$ and $-P$ is vertical ($x=x_1$). This line intersects the curve at $P$, $-P$, and $\\mathcal{O}$.\nAccording to the group law construction, the sum $P + (-P)$ is the inverse of the third intersection point $\\mathcal{O}$.\nThe inverse of $\\mathcal{O}$ is $\\mathcal{O}$ itself (as the line through $\\mathcal{O}$ and $\\mathcal{O}$ is the line at infinity, intersecting at $\\mathcal{O}$ with multiplicity 3).\nThus $P + (-P) = \\mathcal{O}$.\n\n**4. Commutativity (Abelian)**\nThe geometric construction of $P+Q$ depends on the line passing through $P$ and $Q$. The line passing through $P$ and $Q$ is identical to the line passing through $Q$ and $P$. Consequently, the third intersection point $R$ is the same, and the resulting sum $-R$ is the same.\n$$ P + Q = Q + P $$\n\n**5. Associativity**\nWe must show $(P+Q)+R = P+(Q+R)$. This is the non-trivial part of the proof. A direct algebraic verification using the formulas from Part 1 is possible but extremely tedious. We provide a rigorous proof relying on the properties of the complex field $\\mathbb{C}$.\n\nSince $C$ is a non-singular cubic curve over $\\mathbb{C}$, it is a Riemann surface of genus 1. Such a surface is topologically a torus. There exists a biholomorphic group isomorphism (via the Abel-Jacobi map and the Weierstrass $\\wp$-function) between the curve $E(\\mathbb{C})$ and a complex torus $\\mathbb{C}/\\Lambda$, where $\\Lambda$ is a lattice $\\mathbb{Z}\\omega_1 + \\mathbb{Z}\\omega_2$.\n\nThe map is given by $\\Phi: E(\\mathbb{C}) \\to \\mathbb{C}/\\Lambda$, defined by:\n$$ \\Phi(P) = \\int_{\\mathcal{O}}^P \\frac{dx}{y} \\pmod \\Lambda $$\nThe addition of points on the curve corresponds to standard addition of complex numbers modulo the lattice:\n$$ \\Phi(P +_E Q) = \\Phi(P) + \\Phi(Q) \\pmod \\Lambda $$\n(This is a consequence of Abel's Theorem and the addition theorem for elliptic integrals).\n\nSince addition in the complex numbers $\\mathbb{C}$ is associative, addition in the quotient group $\\mathbb{C}/\\Lambda$ is associative. Due to the isomorphism $\\Phi$, the geometric group law on $C$ must also be associative.\n\n*(Note: In a purely algebraic context without reference to $\\mathbb{C}$, associativity is proven using the Cayley-Bacharach theorem regarding the intersection of two cubic curves, which guarantees that if three independent lines involved in the construction of $(P+Q)+R$ and $P+(Q+R)$ intersect the curve at 8 specified points, they must intersect at the same 9th point, implying associativity.)*\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe set of points $E(\\mathbb{C})$ satisfies Closure, Identity, Inverse, Commutativity, and Associativity. Therefore, it forms an abelian group.",

Commutativity (Abelian)**\nThe geometric construction of $P+Q$ depends on the line passing through $P$ and $Q$. The line passing through $P$ and $Q$ is identical to the line passing through $Q$ and $P$. Consequently, the third intersection point $R$ is the same, and the resulting sum $-R$ is the same.\n$$ P + Q = Q + P $$\n\n**5. Associativity**\nWe must show $(P+Q)+R = P+(Q+R)$. This is the non-trivial part of the proof. A direct algebraic verification using the formulas from Part 1 is possible but extremely tedious. We provide a rigorous proof relying on the properties of the complex field $\\mathbb{C}$.\n\nSince $C$ is a non-singular cubic curve over $\\mathbb{C}$, it is a Riemann surface of genus 1. Such a surface is topologically a torus. There exists a biholomorphic group isomorphism (via the Abel-Jacobi map and the Weierstrass $\\wp$-function) between the curve $E(\\mathbb{C})$ and a complex torus $\\mathbb{C}/\\Lambda$, where $\\Lambda$ is a lattice $\\mathbb{Z}\\omega_1 + \\mathbb{Z}\\omega_2$.\n\nThe map is given by $\\Phi: E(\\mathbb{C}) \\to \\mathbb{C}/\\Lambda$, defined by:\n$$ \\Phi(P) = \\int_{\\mathcal{O}}^P \\frac{dx}{y} \\pmod \\Lambda $$\nThe addition of points on the curve corresponds to standard addition of complex numbers modulo the lattice:\n$$ \\Phi(P +_E Q) = \\Phi(P) + \\Phi(Q) \\pmod \\Lambda $$\n(This is a consequence of Abel's Theorem and the addition theorem for elliptic integrals).\n\nSince addition in the complex numbers $\\mathbb{C}$ is associative, addition in the quotient group $\\mathbb{C}/\\Lambda$ is associative. Due to the isomorphism $\\Phi$, the geometric group law on $C$ must also be associative.\n\n*(Note: In a purely algebraic context without reference to $\\mathbb{C}$, associativity is proven using the Cayley-Bacharach theorem regarding the intersection of two cubic curves, which guarantees that if three independent lines involved in the construction of $(P+Q)+R$ and $P+(Q+R)$ intersect the curve at 8 specified points, they must intersect at the same 9th point, implying associativity.)*\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe set of points $E(\\mathbb{C})$ satisfies Closure, Identity, Inverse, Commutativity, and Associativity. Therefore, it forms an abelian group.",

Then $J_k(\\lambda)^2 = \\lambda^2 I + 2\\lambda N + N^2 + \\dots$. The term $2\\lambda N$ ensures the nilpotent part is non-zero (since $2\\lambda \\neq 0$), preventing the matrix from being diagonal. Specifically, the minimal polynomial of $J_k(\\lambda)^2$ will have repeated roots.\nSince $\\det(A) = 8 \\neq 0$, all eigenvalues are non-zero.

The Jordan canonical form is a diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues.\n\n$$ J = \\begin{pmatrix} 6 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{2i}{\\sqrt{3}} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\frac{2i}{\\sqrt{3}} \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n(Note: The order of the diagonal entries can vary, but they represent the same canonical form up to permutation.)\n\nThis matrix satisfies all conditions:\n- $A$ is real (similar to a real matrix with these eigenvalues).\n- $A$ is not diagonalizable over $\\mathbb{R}$ (complex eigenvalues).\n- $A^2$ has eigenvalues $36, -4/3, -4/3$.

Therefore, $\\dim(A) \\neq \\dim(R)$.\n\n*Note: It is possible the question intended to ask to prove $\\dim(B) = \\dim(R)$, or assumed $A$ itself was module-finite, but as stated, the assertion fails.*\n\n---\n\n### Part 2: Conditions for Zero Krull Dimension of B\n\nWe seek the conditions under which $\\dim(B) = 0$.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n1.  **Module Finiteness:** By the problem assumption (interpreted), $B$ is finitely generated as an $R$-module.\n2.  **Integral Extension:** If a commutative ring $B$ is module-finite over $R$, then $B$ is an integral extension of the image of $R$ in $B$. Let $\\phi: R \\to B$ be the structural homomorphism. Then $B$ is integral over the subring $\\phi(R) \\cong R/\\ker(\\phi)$.\n3.  **Relating Dimensions:** For an integral extension $S \\subseteq T$, $\\dim(T) = \\dim(S)$. Thus:\n    $$ \\dim(B) = \\dim(R/\\ker(\\phi)) $$\n    where $\\ker(\\phi) = \\text{Ann}_R(B) = \\{r \\in R \\mid r \\cdot 1_B = 0_B\\}$.\n4.  **Condition for Dimension 0:** $\\dim(B) = 0$ if and only if $\\dim(R/\\text{Ann}_R(B)) = 0$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe Krull dimension of $B$ is zero if and only if the quotient ring $R/\\text{Ann}_R(B)$ is a zero-dimensional ring.\nIn terms of ideal theory, this holds if and only if every prime ideal in $R$ containing $\\text{Ann}_R(B)$ is a maximal ideal.\n\n*Specific cases:*\n- If $R$ is a field, $\\dim(B)=0$ automatically (as $B$ is a finite-dimensional vector space).\n- If $R$ is a domain and $B$ is a faithful module ($\\text{Ann}_R(B)=0$), then $\\dim(B)=0$ requires $R$ to be a field.\n\n---\n\n### Part 3: Krull Dimension for the Specific Case\n\n**Given:**\n- $R = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n- $A = \\mathbb{Z}[x_1, \\dots, x_n]$.\n- $I = \\langle x_1^2 - 2, x_2^2 - 3, \\dots, x_n^2 - p_n \\rangle$, where $p_k$ is the $k$-th prime.\n- $B = A/I$.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1.  **Structure of B:**\n    $$ B \\cong \\mathbb{Z}[x_1, \\dots, x_n] / (x_1^2 - 2, \\dots, x_n^2 - p_n) $$\n    This is isomorphic to the ring generated by adjoining square roots of the first $n$ primes to $\\mathbb{Z}$:\n    $$ B \\cong \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}, \\dots, \\sqrt{p_n}] $$\n\n2.  **Module Finiteness:**\n    As a $\\mathbb{Z}$-module, $B$ is generated by the monomials $x_1^{e_1} \\dots x_n^{e_n}$ where $e_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$. There are $2^n$ such monomials. Since the relations $x_i^2 = p_i$ allow reduction of any higher power, $B$ is a free $\\mathbb{Z}$-module of rank $2^n$.\n    Thus, $B$ is module-finite over $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n3.  **Injectivity of the Map:**\n    Let $\\phi: \\mathbb{Z} \\to B$ be the inclusion map. Since $B$ is a free $\\mathbb{Z}$-module, it has no torsion elements. Specifically, $m \\cdot 1_B = 0 \\implies m=0$. Thus $\\ker(\\phi) = \\{0\\}$.\n    The ring extension $\\mathbb{Z} \\subset B$ is integral (as $B$ is module-finite).\n\n4.  **Applying Dimension Theory:**\n    By the Going Up theorem for integral extensions, if $S \\subseteq T$ is an integral extension where $S$ is a domain, then $\\dim(T) = \\dim(S)$.\n    - $S = \\mathbb{Z}$. $\\dim(\\mathbb{Z}) = 1$ (Since $\\mathbb{Z}$ is a Principal Ideal Domain but not a field, prime chains are of the form $(0) \\subset (p)$).\n    - $T = B$. $B$ is a subring of the field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\dots, \\sqrt{p_n})$, so $B$ is an integral domain.\n\n    Therefore:\n    $$ \\dim(B) = \\dim(\\mathbb{Z}) = 1 $$\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe Krull dimension of $B$ is **1**.",

The Krull dimension $\\dim(A) = 1$.\n4.  Let $f_1 = x^2$. The ideal $I = (x^2) \\subset A$.\n5.  Define $B = A/I = k[x]/(x^2)$.\n6.  The set $\\{1, \\bar{x}\\}$ forms a basis for $B$ over $k$. Thus, $B$ is a finite-dimensional vector space over $R$ (dimension 2).\n7.  We observe that $\\dim(A) = 1$ and $\\dim(R) = 0$.\n8.  Therefore, $\\dim(A) \\neq \\dim(R)$.\n\n*Note: It is possible the question intended to ask to prove $\\dim(B) = \\dim(R)$, or assumed $A$ itself was module-finite, but as stated, the assertion fails.*\n\n---\n\n### Part 2: Conditions for Zero Krull Dimension of B\n\nWe seek the conditions under which $\\dim(B) = 0$.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n1.  **Module Finiteness:** By the problem assumption (interpreted), $B$ is finitely generated as an $R$-module.\n2.  **Integral Extension:** If a commutative ring $B$ is module-finite over $R$, then $B$ is an integral extension of the image of $R$ in $B$. Let $\\phi: R \\to B$ be the structural homomorphism. Then $B$ is integral over the subring $\\phi(R) \\cong R/\\ker(\\phi)$.\n3.  **Relating Dimensions:** For an integral extension $S \\subseteq T$, $\\dim(T) = \\dim(S)$. Thus:\n    $$ \\dim(B) = \\dim(R/\\ker(\\phi)) $$\n    where $\\ker(\\phi) = \\text{Ann}_R(B) = \\{r \\in R \\mid r \\cdot 1_B = 0_B\\}$.\n4.  **Condition for Dimension 0:** $\\dim(B) = 0$ if and only if $\\dim(R/\\text{Ann}_R(B)) = 0$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe Krull dimension of $B$ is zero if and only if the quotient ring $R/\\text{Ann}_R(B)$ is a zero-dimensional ring.\nIn terms of ideal theory, this holds if and only if every prime ideal in $R$ containing $\\text{Ann}_R(B)$ is a maximal ideal.\n\n*Specific cases:*\n- If $R$ is a field, $\\dim(B)=0$ automatically (as $B$ is a finite-dimensional vector space).\n- If $R$ is a domain and $B$ is a faithful module ($\\text{Ann}_R(B)=0$), then $\\dim(B)=0$ requires $R$ to be a field.\n\n---\n\n### Part 3: Krull Dimension for the Specific Case\n\n**Given:**\n- $R = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n- $A = \\mathbb{Z}[x_1, \\dots, x_n]$.\n- $I = \\langle x_1^2 - 2, x_2^2 - 3, \\dots, x_n^2 - p_n \\rangle$, where $p_k$ is the $k$-th prime.\n- $B = A/I$.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1.  **Structure of B:**\n    $$ B \\cong \\mathbb{Z}[x_1, \\dots, x_n] / (x_1^2 - 2, \\dots, x_n^2 - p_n) $$\n    This is isomorphic to the ring generated by adjoining square roots of the first $n$ primes to $\\mathbb{Z}$:\n    $$ B \\cong \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}, \\dots, \\sqrt{p_n}] $$\n\n2.  **Module Finiteness:**\n    As a $\\mathbb{Z}$-module, $B$ is generated by the monomials $x_1^{e_1} \\dots x_n^{e_n}$ where $e_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$. There are $2^n$ such monomials. Since the relations $x_i^2 = p_i$ allow reduction of any higher power, $B$ is a free $\\mathbb{Z}$-module of rank $2^n$.\n    Thus, $B$ is module-finite over $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n3.  **Injectivity of the Map:**\n    Let $\\phi: \\mathbb{Z} \\to B$ be the inclusion map. Since $B$ is a free $\\mathbb{Z}$-module, it has no torsion elements. Specifically, $m \\cdot 1_B = 0 \\implies m=0$. Thus $\\ker(\\phi) = \\{0\\}$.\n    The ring extension $\\mathbb{Z} \\subset B$ is integral (as $B$ is module-finite).\n\n4.  **Applying Dimension Theory:**\n    By the Going Up theorem for integral extensions, if $S \\subseteq T$ is an integral extension where $S$ is a domain, then $\\dim(T) = \\dim(S)$.\n    - $S = \\mathbb{Z}$. $\\dim(\\mathbb{Z}) = 1$ (Since $\\mathbb{Z}$ is a Principal Ideal Domain but not a field, prime chains are of the form $(0) \\subset (p)$).\n    - $T = B$. $B$ is a subring of the field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\dots, \\sqrt{p_n})$, so $B$ is an integral domain.\n\n    Therefore:\n    $$ \\dim(B) = \\dim(\\mathbb{Z}) = 1 $$\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe Krull dimension of $B$ is **1**.",

This theorem allows us to treat objects in $\\mathcal{C}$ as modules over a ring and morphisms as module homomorphisms. Consequently, we can use element-wise diagram chasing to prove exactness.\n\nLet the differentials of the complexes $K^\\bullet, L^\\bullet, M^\\bullet$ be denoted by $d_K, d_L, d_M$ respectively (lowering degree by 1).\n\n**Step 1: Construction of the Connecting Homomorphism $\\delta_n$**\nWe construct the map $\\delta_n: H_n(M^\\bullet) \\to H_{n-1}(K^\\bullet)$ using the \"snake\" or \"zig-zag\" construction.\n\n1.  Let $[z] \\in H_n(M^\\bullet)$ be a homology class represented by a cycle $z \\in M_n$. Thus, $d_M(z) = 0$.\n2.  Since the sequence $0 \\to K_n \\to L_n \\xrightarrow{\\beta} M_n \\to 0$ is exact, $\\beta$ is surjective. There exists $y \\in L_n$ such that $\\beta(y) = z$.\n3.  Apply the boundary operator $d_L$ to $y$. By the commutativity of the diagram ($\\beta d_L = d_M \\beta$), we have:\n    $$ \\beta(d_L(y)) = d_M(\\beta(y)) = d_M(z) = 0 $$\n4.  Since $d_L(y) \\in \\text{Ker}(\\beta)$, and by exactness $\\text{Ker}(\\beta) = \\text{Im}(\\alpha)$, there exists a unique $x \\in K_{n-1}$ such that $\\alpha(x) = d_L(y)$.\n5.  We check that $x$ is a cycle in $K_{n-1}$. Apply $\\alpha$ to $d_K(x)$:\n    $$ \\alpha(d_K(x)) = d_L(\\alpha(x)) = d_L(d_L(y)) = 0 $$\n    Since $\\alpha$ is injective (monomorphism), $d_K(x) = 0$.\n6.  Define $\\delta_n([z]) = [x] \\in H_{n-1}(K^\\bullet)$.\n\n**Step 2: Well-definedness**\nWe must show $\\delta_n$ is independent of the choices of representative $z$ and lift $y$.\n*   **Independence of lift $y$**: Let $y'$ be another lift of $z$. Then $\\beta(y-y') = 0$, so $y-y' = \\alpha(k)$ for some $k \\in K_n$. Then $d_L(y) - d_L(y') = d_L(\\alpha(k)) = \\alpha(d_K(k))$. The resulting elements $x, x'$ satisfy $\\alpha(x-x') = \\alpha(d_K(k))$. Since $\\alpha$ is injective, $x - x' = d_K(k)$, so $[x] = [x']$ in homology.\n*   **Independence of representative $z$**: Let $z' = z + d_M(m)$ for $m \\in M_{n+1}$. Lift $m$ to $l \\in L_{n+1}$. Then $y' = y + d_L(l)$ is a lift of $z'$. Then $d_L(y') = d_L(y) + d_L^2(l) = d_L(y)$. The element $x$ remains unchanged.\n\n**Step 3: Exactness**\nWe verify exactness at each node.\n*   **Exactness at $H_n(M^\\bullet)$ ($\\text{Im}(\\beta_*) = \\text{Ker}(\\delta_n)$)**:\n    *   $\\subseteq$: If $z = \\beta(c)$ for a cycle $c \\in L_n$, we can choose $y=c$ as the lift. Then $d_L(y) = d_L(c) = 0$. Thus $\\alpha(x)=0 \\implies x=0$. So $\\delta_n([z]) = 0$.\n    *   $\\supseteq$: If $\\delta_n([z]) = 0$, then the constructed $x$ is a boundary $d_K(k)$. $\\alpha(x) = \\alpha(d_K(k)) = d_L(\\alpha(k))$. We had $\\alpha(x) = d_L(y)$, so $d_L(y - \\alpha(k)) = 0$. Let $c = y - \\alpha(k)$. $c$ is a cycle in $L_n$ and $\\beta(c) = \\beta(y) - 0 = z$.

Let $[z] \\in H_n(M^\\bullet)$ be a homology class represented by a cycle $z \\in M_n$. Thus, $d_M(z) = 0$.\n2.  Since the sequence $0 \\to K_n \\to L_n \\xrightarrow{\\beta} M_n \\to 0$ is exact, $\\beta$ is surjective. There exists $y \\in L_n$ such that $\\beta(y) = z$.\n3.  Apply the boundary operator $d_L$ to $y$. By the commutativity of the diagram ($\\beta d_L = d_M \\beta$), we have:\n    $$ \\beta(d_L(y)) = d_M(\\beta(y)) = d_M(z) = 0 $$\n4.  Since $d_L(y) \\in \\text{Ker}(\\beta)$, and by exactness $\\text{Ker}(\\beta) = \\text{Im}(\\alpha)$, there exists a unique $x \\in K_{n-1}$ such that $\\alpha(x) = d_L(y)$.\n5.  We check that $x$ is a cycle in $K_{n-1}$. Apply $\\alpha$ to $d_K(x)$:\n    $$ \\alpha(d_K(x)) = d_L(\\alpha(x)) = d_L(d_L(y)) = 0 $$\n    Since $\\alpha$ is injective (monomorphism), $d_K(x) = 0$.\n6.  Define $\\delta_n([z]) = [x] \\in H_{n-1}(K^\\bullet)$.\n\n**Step 2: Well-definedness**\nWe must show $\\delta_n$ is independent of the choices of representative $z$ and lift $y$.\n*   **Independence of lift $y$**: Let $y'$ be another lift of $z$. Then $\\beta(y-y') = 0$, so $y-y' = \\alpha(k)$ for some $k \\in K_n$. Then $d_L(y) - d_L(y') = d_L(\\alpha(k)) = \\alpha(d_K(k))$. The resulting elements $x, x'$ satisfy $\\alpha(x-x') = \\alpha(d_K(k))$. Since $\\alpha$ is injective, $x - x' = d_K(k)$, so $[x] = [x']$ in homology.\n*   **Independence of representative $z$**: Let $z' = z + d_M(m)$ for $m \\in M_{n+1}$. Lift $m$ to $l \\in L_{n+1}$. Then $y' = y + d_L(l)$ is a lift of $z'$. Then $d_L(y') = d_L(y) + d_L^2(l) = d_L(y)$. The element $x$ remains unchanged.\n\n**Step 3: Exactness**\nWe verify exactness at each node.\n*   **Exactness at $H_n(M^\\bullet)$ ($\\text{Im}(\\beta_*) = \\text{Ker}(\\delta_n)$)**:\n    *   $\\subseteq$: If $z = \\beta(c)$ for a cycle $c \\in L_n$, we can choose $y=c$ as the lift. Then $d_L(y) = d_L(c) = 0$. Thus $\\alpha(x)=0 \\implies x=0$. So $\\delta_n([z]) = 0$.\n    *   $\\supseteq$: If $\\delta_n([z]) = 0$, then the constructed $x$ is a boundary $d_K(k)$. $\\alpha(x) = \\alpha(d_K(k)) = d_L(\\alpha(k))$. We had $\\alpha(x) = d_L(y)$, so $d_L(y - \\alpha(k)) = 0$. Let $c = y - \\alpha(k)$. $c$ is a cycle in $L_n$ and $\\beta(c) = \\beta(y) - 0 = z$. Thus $[z] \\in \\text{Im}(\\beta_*)$.\n\n*   **Exactness at $H_{n-1}(K^\\bullet)$ ($\\text{Im}(\\delta_n) = \\text{Ker}(\\alpha_*)$)**:\n    *   $\\subseteq$: $\\alpha_*(\\delta_n([z])) = [\\alpha(x)] = [d_L(y)] = 0$ in $H_{n-1}(L^\\bullet)$ because it is a boundary.\n    *   $\\supseteq$: Let $[x] \\in H_{n-1}(K^\\bullet)$ with $\\alpha_*([x]) = 0$.

Proof that $f^*$ is an Isomorphism\n\nWe establish that $f^*$ is an isomorphism by utilizing the functorial nature of the $K_0$ construction and the pullback operation.\n\n**Step 1: Functoriality of the Pullback**\nThe assignment of the Grothendieck group $K(X) \\cong K_0(C(X))$ is a contravariant functor from the category of compact Hausdorff spaces to the category of Abelian groups. Specifically, for continuous maps $g: X \\to Y$ and $h: Y \\to Z$, the pullback satisfies the composition law up to natural isomorphism:\n$$ (h \\circ g)^* E \\cong g^* (h^* E) $$\nfor any vector bundle $E$ over $Z$. Consequently, the induced maps on the $K$-groups satisfy:\n$$ (h \\circ g)^* = g^* \\circ h^* $$\nAdditionally, the identity map $\\text{id}_X: X \\to X$ induces the identity map on $K_0(C(X))$ because the pullback of a bundle by the identity map is isomorphic to the original bundle:\n$$ (\\text{id}_X)^* = \\text{id}_{K_0(C(X))} $$\n\n**Step 2: Application to the Homeomorphism $f$**\nWe are given that $f: X \\to X$ is a homeomorphism.

Effect on the Trivial Module $C(X)$\n\nWe now determine the image of the class $[C(X)]$ under the map $f^*$.\n\n**Identification of the Trivial Module:**\nThe trivial module is the free $C(X)$-module of rank 1, denoted here as $M = C(X)$. This module corresponds to the trivial line bundle $E = X \\times \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**Topological Perspective:**\nThe pullback of a trivial bundle is trivial. Specifically, if $E = X \\times \\mathbb{R}$, then:\n$$ f^*E = \\{(x, (y, v)) \\in X \\times (X \\times \\mathbb{R}) \\mid f(x) = y \\} $$\nThe map $\\psi: f^*E \\to X \\times \\mathbb{R}$ defined by $(x, (f(x), v)) \\mapsto (x, v)$ is a vector bundle isomorphism over the identity map of $X$. Since $f^*E$ is isomorphic to the trivial bundle $X \\times \\mathbb{R}$, its associated section module is isomorphic to $C(X)$.\n\n**Algebraic Perspective (Rigorous Verification):**\nLet $\\phi = f^\\#: C(X) \\to C(X)$ be the ring automorphism given by $\\phi(u) = u \\circ f$.\nThe algebraic pullback of the module $M=C(X)$ is the tensor product:\n$$ f^* M = C(X) \\otimes_{C(X), \\phi} C(X) $$\nWe define a map $\\Psi: C(X) \\otimes_{C(X), \\phi} C(X) \\to C(X)$ by:\n$$ \\Psi(m \\otimes a) = \\phi(m)a $$\nfor $m \\in M$ and $a \\in C(X)$ (where $m$ is viewed as a function).\n\nTo verify $\\Psi$ is a module isomorphism:\n1.  **Well-definedness (Balanced Tensor):**\n    For any $u \\in C(X)$, we must ensure $m u \\otimes a$ and $m \\otimes \\phi(u)a$ map to the same value.\n    $$ \\Psi(m u \\otimes a) = \\phi(m u)a = \\phi(m)\\phi(u)a $$\n    $$ \\Psi(m \\otimes \\phi(u)a) = \\phi(m)(\\phi(u)a) = \\phi(m)\\phi(u)a $$\n    They are equal.\n2.  **Surjectivity:**\n    $\\Psi(1 \\otimes 1) = \\phi(1) \\cdot 1 = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$. Since $1$ generates $C(X)$ as a module, $\\Psi$ is surjective.\n3.  **Injectivity:**\n    Since $C(X) \\otimes_{C(X), \\phi} C(X)$ is the extension of scalars of a free module of rank 1 by an automorphism, it remains a free module of rank 1. A surjective map between free modules of the same finite rank over a commutative ring is an isomorphism.\n\nThus, $f^* C(X)$ is isomorphic to $C(X)$ as a $C(X)$-module.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nIn the Grothendieck group $K_0(C(X))$, the class of the pullback is equal to the class of the original module:\n$$ f^*([C(X)]) = [C(X)] $$\n\n### Final Answer\n\n1.  The map $f^*: K_0(C(X)) \\to K_0(C(X))$ is an **isomorphism**. This follows directly from the functoriality of the $K_0$ construction and the fact that $f$ is a homeomorphism (implying $f$ has a continuous inverse).\n2.

Consequently, the induced maps on the $K$-groups satisfy:\n$$ (h \\circ g)^* = g^* \\circ h^* $$\nAdditionally, the identity map $\\text{id}_X: X \\to X$ induces the identity map on $K_0(C(X))$ because the pullback of a bundle by the identity map is isomorphic to the original bundle:\n$$ (\\text{id}_X)^* = \\text{id}_{K_0(C(X))} $$\n\n**Step 2: Application to the Homeomorphism $f$**\nWe are given that $f: X \\to X$ is a homeomorphism. Therefore, there exists a continuous inverse map $g: X \\to X$ such that:\n$$ f \\circ g = \\text{id}_X \\quad \\text{and} \\quad g \\circ f = \\text{id}_X $$\n\nApplying the contravariant functor $K_0$ to these equalities:\n1.  $(f \\circ g)^* = g^* \\circ f^*$\n    Since $(f \\circ g)^* = (\\text{id}_X)^* = \\text{id}_{K_0(C(X))}$, we have $g^* \\circ f^* = \\text{id}$.\n2.  $(g \\circ f)^* = f^* \\circ g^*$\n    Since $(g \\circ f)^* = (\\text{id}_X)^* = \\text{id}_{K_0(C(X))}$, we have $f^* \\circ g^* = \\text{id}$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSince $f^*$ has a two-sided inverse $g^*$, the map $f^*: K_0(C(X)) \\to K_0(C(X))$ is a group isomorphism.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Effect on the Trivial Module $C(X)$\n\nWe now determine the image of the class $[C(X)]$ under the map $f^*$.\n\n**Identification of the Trivial Module:**\nThe trivial module is the free $C(X)$-module of rank 1, denoted here as $M = C(X)$. This module corresponds to the trivial line bundle $E = X \\times \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**Topological Perspective:**\nThe pullback of a trivial bundle is trivial. Specifically, if $E = X \\times \\mathbb{R}$, then:\n$$ f^*E = \\{(x, (y, v)) \\in X \\times (X \\times \\mathbb{R}) \\mid f(x) = y \\} $$\nThe map $\\psi: f^*E \\to X \\times \\mathbb{R}$ defined by $(x, (f(x), v)) \\mapsto (x, v)$ is a vector bundle isomorphism over the identity map of $X$. Since $f^*E$ is isomorphic to the trivial bundle $X \\times \\mathbb{R}$, its associated section module is isomorphic to $C(X)$.\n\n**Algebraic Perspective (Rigorous Verification):**\nLet $\\phi = f^\\#: C(X) \\to C(X)$ be the ring automorphism given by $\\phi(u) = u \\circ f$.\nThe algebraic pullback of the module $M=C(X)$ is the tensor product:\n$$ f^* M = C(X) \\otimes_{C(X), \\phi} C(X) $$\nWe define a map $\\Psi: C(X) \\otimes_{C(X), \\phi} C(X) \\to C(X)$ by:\n$$ \\Psi(m \\otimes a) = \\phi(m)a $$\nfor $m \\in M$ and $a \\in C(X)$ (where $m$ is viewed as a function).\n\nTo verify $\\Psi$ is a module isomorphism:\n1.  **Well-definedness (Balanced Tensor):**\n    For any $u \\in C(X)$, we must ensure $m u \\otimes a$ and $m \\otimes \\phi(u)a$ map to the same value.\n    $$ \\Psi(m u \\otimes a) = \\phi(m u)a = \\phi(m)\\phi(u)a $$\n    $$ \\Psi(m \\otimes \\phi(u)a) = \\phi(m)(\\phi(u)a) = \\phi(m)\\phi(u)a $$\n    They are equal.\n2.  **Surjectivity:**\n    $\\Psi(1 \\otimes 1) = \\phi(1) \\cdot 1 = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$. Since $1$ generates $C(X)$ as a module, $\\Psi$ is surjective.\n3.  **Injectivity:**\n    Since $C(X) \\otimes_{C(X), \\phi} C(X)$ is the extension of scalars of a free module of rank 1 by an automorphism, it remains a free module of rank 1. A surjective map between free modules of the same finite rank over a commutative ring is an isomorphism.\n\nThus, $f^* C(X)$ is isomorphic to $C(X)$ as a $C(X)$-module.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nIn the Grothendieck group $K_0(C(X))$, the class of the pullback is equal to the class of the original module:\n$$ f^*([C(X)]) = [C(X)] $$\n\n### Final Answer\n\n1.  The map $f^*: K_0(C(X)) \\to K_0(C(X))$ is an **isomorphism**. This follows directly from the functoriality of the $K_0$ construction and the fact that $f$ is a homeomorphism (implying $f$ has a continuous inverse).\n2.  The effect of $f^*$ on the class of the trivial module is the **identity**. Specifically, $f^*([C(X)]) = [C(X)]$.",

A subset $X \\subseteq U$ is a **complex analytic variety** (or analytic set) if for every point $p \\in U$, there exists a neighborhood $W$ of $p$ in $U$ and a collection of holomorphic functions $g_1, \\dots, g_k$ defined on $W$ such that:\n$$ X \\cap W = \\{ z \\in W \\mid g_1(z) = \\dots = g_k(z) = 0 \\}. $$\n\n**Proof:**\n1.  Identify the domain and function: Here, $U = \\mathbb{C}^2$. The function is given by $f(z_1, z_2) = z_1^2 + z_2^2 - 1$.\n2.  Holomorphicity: The function $f$ is a polynomial in variables $z_1$ and $z_2$. Polynomials are holomorphic on the entire complex space $\\mathbb{C}^n$. Therefore, $f$ is holomorphic on $\\mathbb{C}^2$.\n3.  Global Definition: We can choose the neighborhood $W = \\mathbb{C}^2$ for every point $p$. The set $V(f)$ is defined globally as the zero locus of this single holomorphic function:\n    $$ V(f) = \\{ (z_1, z_2) \\in \\mathbb{C}^2 \\mid f(z_1, z_2) = 0 \\}. $$\n4.  Conclusion: Since $V(f)$ is locally (in fact, globally) the zero set of a holomorphic function, $V(f)$ satisfies the definition of a complex analytic variety.\n\n***\n\n### 2. Determine the dimension of $V(f)$.\n\n**Reasoning:**\nFor a complex analytic variety defined by a single non-trivial holomorphic function $f$ on a connected open set $U \\subseteq \\mathbb{C}^n$, the complex dimension of the variety $V(f)$ is $n-1$ at regular points (points where $\\nabla f \\neq 0$).\n\n1.  **Non-triviality:** We observe that $f(0,0) = -1 \\neq 0$ and $f(1,0) = 0$. Thus, $f$ is not identically zero, and $V(f)$ is not empty.\n2.  **Gradient Check:** Consider the gradient of $f$:\n    $$ \\nabla f(z_1, z_2) = \\left( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z_1}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z_2} \\right) = (2z_1, 2z_2). $$\n3.  **Regularity:** A point $p \\in V(f)$ is a regular point if $\\nabla f(p) \\neq (0,0)$. If $\\nabla f(p) \\neq 0$, the Complex Implicit Function Theorem guarantees that locally around $p$, $V(f)$ is a complex manifold of dimension $n-1$.\n    Here, $n=2$. The gradient $(2z_1, 2z_2)$ vanishes only at the origin $(0,0)$. However, the origin is not in $V(f)$ because $f(0,0) = -1 \\neq 0$.\n    Therefore, for all $p \\in V(f)$, $\\nabla f(p) \\neq 0$.\n4.  **Conclusion:** Every point in $V(f)$ is a regular point. Thus, $V(f)$ is a complex submanifold of $\\mathbb{C}^2$ of complex dimension $2-1=1$.\n\n**Answer:** The complex dimension of $V(f)$ is **1**.\n\n***\n\n### 3. Show that $V(f)$ is irreducible.\n\n**Concept:**\nA complex analytic variety is irreducible if it cannot be written as the union of two proper analytic subsets. For a smooth analytic variety (a complex manifold), irreducibility is equivalent to the set being **connected**.\n\nFrom Part 2 (and Part 4 below), we know that $V(f)$ is smooth everywhere (it has no singular points). Therefore, it suffices to show that $V(f)$ is connected.\n\n**Proof of Connectivity:**\nWe can construct a biholomorphism between $V(f)$ and the punctured complex plane $\\mathbb{C}^* = \\mathbb{C} \\setminus \\{0\\}$, which is known to be connected.\n\n1.  Factor the equation $z_1^2 + z_2^2 = 1$ using complex coordinates:\n    $$ z_1^2 + z_2^2 = (z_1 - i z_2)(z_1 + i z_2) = 1. $$\n2.  Define a map $\\phi: V(f) \\to \\mathbb{C}^*$ by:\n    $$ \\phi(z_1, z_2) = z_1 - i z_2. $$\n    Note that if $(z_1, z_2) \\in V(f)$, then $(z_1 - i z_2)(z_1 + i z_2) = 1$, which implies $z_1 - i z_2 \\neq 0$. Thus the image is indeed in $\\mathbb{C}^*$.\n3.  We can explicitly find the inverse. Let $w = z_1 - i z_2$. Then $z_1 + i z_2 = 1/w$.\n    Adding and subtracting these equations:\n    $$ (z_1 - i z_2) + (z_1 + i z_2) = w + \\frac{1}{w} \\implies 2z_1 = w + \\frac{1}{w} \\implies z_1 = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(w + \\frac{1}{w}\\right). $$\n    $$ (z_1 + i z_2) - (z_1 - i z_2) = \\frac{1}{w} - w \\implies 2i z_2 = \\frac{1}{w} - w \\implies z_2 = \\frac{1}{2i}\\left(\\frac{1}{w} - w\\right) = \\frac{i}{2}\\left(w - \\frac{1}{w}\\right). $$\n4.  Consider the map $\\psi: \\mathbb{C}^* \\to \\mathbb{C}^2$ defined by $\\psi(w) = \\left( \\frac{1}{2}(w + w^{-1}), \\frac{i}{2}(w - w^{-1}) \\right)$.\n    We verify $\\psi(w) \\in V(f)$:\n    $$ \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}(w + w^{-1}) \\right]^2 + \\left[ \\frac{i}{2}(w - w^{-1}) \\right]^2 = \\frac{1}{4}(w^2 + 2 + w^{-2}) - \\frac{1}{4}(w^2 - 2 + w^{-2}) = \\frac{1}{4}(4) = 1. $$\n5.  Since $\\psi$ is holomorphic on $\\mathbb{C}^*$ and is the inverse of $\\phi$, $V(f)$ is biholomorphic to $\\mathbb{C}^*$.\n6.  The set $\\mathbb{C}^*$ is path-connected (and thus connected). As connectivity is a topological property preserved by homeomorphism (and biholomorphism), $V(f)$ is connected.\n7.  Since $V(f)$ is a connected complex manifold, it is irreducible.\n\n***\n\n### 4. Find all singular points of $V(f)$.\n\n**Definition:**\nA point $p \\in V(f)$ is a singular point if the gradient of the defining function vanishes at $p$. That is, $p$ must satisfy two conditions simultaneously:\n1.  $f(p) = 0$ (the point lies on the variety).\n2.  $\\nabla f(p) = (0, \\dots, 0)$.\n\n**Calculation:**\n1.  Compute the partial derivatives of $f(z_1, z_2) = z_1^2 + z_2^2 - 1$:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z_1} = 2z_1 $$\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z_2} = 2z_2 $$\n2.  Set the gradient to zero:\n    $$ 2z_1 = 0 \\implies z_1 = 0 $$\n    $$ 2z_2 = 0 \\implies z_2 = 0 $$\n    So, the only point in $\\mathbb{C}^2$ where the gradient vanishes is $(0, 0)$.\n3.  Check if this point lies on the variety $V(f)$:\n    Evaluate $f(0, 0)$:\n    $$ f(0, 0) = 0^2 + 0^2 - 1 = -1. $$\n4.  Since $f(0, 0) = -1 \\neq 0$, the point $(0, 0)$ is not in $V(f)$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThere are no points in $V(f)$ where the gradient vanishes. Therefore, the set of singular points is empty.\n\n**Final Answer:** The set of singular points of $V(f)$ is **empty** (denoted as $\\emptyset$).",

Factor the equation $z_1^2 + z_2^2 = 1$ using complex coordinates:\n    $$ z_1^2 + z_2^2 = (z_1 - i z_2)(z_1 + i z_2) = 1. $$\n2.  Define a map $\\phi: V(f) \\to \\mathbb{C}^*$ by:\n    $$ \\phi(z_1, z_2) = z_1 - i z_2. $$\n    Note that if $(z_1, z_2) \\in V(f)$, then $(z_1 - i z_2)(z_1 + i z_2) = 1$, which implies $z_1 - i z_2 \\neq 0$. Thus the image is indeed in $\\mathbb{C}^*$.\n3.  We can explicitly find the inverse. Let $w = z_1 - i z_2$. Then $z_1 + i z_2 = 1/w$.\n    Adding and subtracting these equations:\n    $$ (z_1 - i z_2) + (z_1 + i z_2) = w + \\frac{1}{w} \\implies 2z_1 = w + \\frac{1}{w} \\implies z_1 = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(w + \\frac{1}{w}\\right). $$\n    $$ (z_1 + i z_2) - (z_1 - i z_2) = \\frac{1}{w} - w \\implies 2i z_2 = \\frac{1}{w} - w \\implies z_2 = \\frac{1}{2i}\\left(\\frac{1}{w} - w\\right) = \\frac{i}{2}\\left(w - \\frac{1}{w}\\right). $$\n4.  Consider the map $\\psi: \\mathbb{C}^* \\to \\mathbb{C}^2$ defined by $\\psi(w) = \\left( \\frac{1}{2}(w + w^{-1}), \\frac{i}{2}(w - w^{-1}) \\right)$.\n    We verify $\\psi(w) \\in V(f)$:\n    $$ \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}(w + w^{-1}) \\right]^2 + \\left[ \\frac{i}{2}(w - w^{-1}) \\right]^2 = \\frac{1}{4}(w^2 + 2 + w^{-2}) - \\frac{1}{4}(w^2 - 2 + w^{-2}) = \\frac{1}{4}(4) = 1. $$\n5.  Since $\\psi$ is holomorphic on $\\mathbb{C}^*$ and is the inverse of $\\phi$, $V(f)$ is biholomorphic to $\\mathbb{C}^*$.\n6.  The set $\\mathbb{C}^*$ is path-connected (and thus connected). As connectivity is a topological property preserved by homeomorphism (and biholomorphism), $V(f)$ is connected.\n7.  Since $V(f)$ is a connected complex manifold, it is irreducible.\n\n***\n\n### 4. Find all singular points of $V(f)$.\n\n**Definition:**\nA point $p \\in V(f)$ is a singular point if the gradient of the defining function vanishes at $p$. That is, $p$ must satisfy two conditions simultaneously:\n1.  $f(p) = 0$ (the point lies on the variety).\n2.  $\\nabla f(p) = (0, \\dots, 0)$.\n\n**Calculation:**\n1.  Compute the partial derivatives of $f(z_1, z_2) = z_1^2 + z_2^2 - 1$:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z_1} = 2z_1 $$\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z_2} = 2z_2 $$\n2.  Set the gradient to zero:\n    $$ 2z_1 = 0 \\implies z_1 = 0 $$\n    $$ 2z_2 = 0 \\implies z_2 = 0 $$\n    So, the only point in $\\mathbb{C}^2$ where the gradient vanishes is $(0, 0)$.\n3.  Check if this point lies on the variety $V(f)$:\n    Evaluate $f(0, 0)$:\n    $$ f(0, 0) = 0^2 + 0^2 - 1 = -1. $$\n4.  Since $f(0, 0) = -1 \\neq 0$, the point $(0, 0)$ is not in $V(f)$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThere are no points in $V(f)$ where the gradient vanishes. Therefore, the set of singular points is empty.\n\n**Final Answer:** The set of singular points of $V(f)$ is **empty** (denoted as $\\emptyset$).",

We compute the derivatives:\n$$\ny' = r x^{r-1}\n$$\n$$\ny'' = r(r-1) x^{r-2}\n$$\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the differential equation yields:\n$$\nx^2 [r(r-1) x^{r-2}] + 2x [r x^{r-1}] + 2 [x^r] = 0\n$$\n\nSimplifying the terms:\n$$\n(r(r-1) + 2r + 2) x^r = 0\n$$\n\nSince $x > 0$, $x^r \\neq 0$, so we must have:\n$$\nr^2 - r + 2r + 2 = 0\n$$\n$$\nr^2 + r + 2 = 0\n$$\n\nWe solve this characteristic quadratic equation for $r$ using the quadratic formula:\n$$\nr = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2 - 4(1)(2)}}{2}\n$$\n$$\nr = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - 8}}{2}\n$$\n$$\nr = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{-7}}{2}\n$$\n$$\nr = -\\frac{1}{2} \\pm i \\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{2}\n$$\n\nThe roots are complex conjugates $\\alpha \\pm i \\beta$ with $\\alpha = -\\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\beta = \\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{2}$.\n\nFor a Cauchy-Euler equation with complex roots $\\alpha \\pm i \\beta$, the general solution is:\n$$\ny(x) = x^{\\alpha} \\left[ c_1 \\cos(\\beta \\ln x) + c_2 \\sin(\\beta \\ln x) \\right]\n$$\n\nSubstituting our values for $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$:\n$$\ny(x) = x^{-1/2} \\left[ c_1 \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{2} \\ln x\\right) + c_2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{2} \\ln x\\right) \\right]\n$$\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n$$\ny(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x}} \\left[ c_1 \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{2} \\ln x\\right) + c_2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{2} \\ln x\\right) \\right]\n$$\nwhere $c_1$ and $c_2$ are arbitrary real constants.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Particular Solution\n\nWe are given the initial conditions $y(1) = 1$ and $y'(1) = 0$.\n\n**Step 1: Apply the condition $y(1) = 1$.**\n\nSubstitute $x = 1$ into the general solution. Note that $\\ln(1) = 0$, $\\cos(0) = 1$, and $\\sin(0) = 0$.\n$$\ny(1) = (1)^{-1/2} \\left[ c_1 \\cos(0) + c_2 \\sin(0) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n1 = 1 \\cdot [ c_1(1) + 0 ]\n$$\n$$\nc_1 = 1\n$$\n\nSo the solution simplifies to:\n$$\ny(x) = x^{-1/2} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{2} \\ln x\\right) + c_2 x^{-1/2} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{2} \\ln x\\right)\n$$\n\n**Step 2: Differentiate $y(x)$ to apply $y'(1) = 0$.**\n\nLet $\\theta = \\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{2} \\ln x$. By the chain rule, $\\frac{d\\theta}{dx} = \\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{2x}$.\nUsing the product rule on $y(x) = x^{-1/2} \\left[ \\cos \\theta + c_2 \\sin \\theta \\right]$:\n\n$$\ny'(x) = -\\frac{1}{2}x^{-3/2} \\left[ \\cos \\theta + c_2 \\sin \\theta \\right] + x^{-1/2} \\left[ -\\sin \\theta \\cdot \\frac{d\\theta}{dx} + c_2 \\cos \\theta \\cdot \\frac{d\\theta}{dx} \\right]\n$$\n\nSubstitute $\\frac{d\\theta}{dx} = \\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{2x}$:\n$$\ny'(x) = -\\frac{1}{2}x^{-3/2} \\left[ \\cos \\theta + c_2 \\sin \\theta \\right] + x^{-1/2} \\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{2x} \\left[ -\\sin \\theta + c_2 \\cos \\theta \\right]\n$$\n$$\ny'(x) = \\frac{1}{2} x^{-3/2} \\left( -\\left[ \\cos \\theta + c_2 \\sin \\theta \\right] + \\sqrt{7} \\left[ -\\sin \\theta + c_2 \\cos \\theta \\right] \\right)\n$$\n\nNow evaluate at $x = 1$.

Invariance of Lebesgue Measure**\nFirst, we verify that $\\mu$ is an invariant measure for $T$. A measure $\\mu$ is invariant under $T$ if $\\mu(T^{-1}(A)) = \\mu(A)$ for any measurable set $A \\subseteq [0, 1]$.\n\nLet $A = [a, b] \\subseteq [0, 1]$. The preimage $T^{-1}(A)$ is the set of points $x$ such that $T(x) \\in [a, b]$. Using the definition of $T$:\n$$\nT^{-1}([a, b]) = \\left\\{ x \\in \\left[0, \\frac{1}{2}\\right) : 2x \\in [a, b] \\right\\} \\cup \\left\\{ x \\in \\left[\\frac{1}{2}, 1\\right] : 2x - 1 \\in [a, b] \\right\\}\n$$\n$$\nT^{-1}([a, b]) = \\left[ \\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{b}{2} \\right] \\cup \\left[ \\frac{a+1}{2}, \\frac{b+1}{2} \\right]\n$$\nThese two intervals are disjoint (the first lies in $[0, 0.5]$ and the second in $[0.5, 1]$). The measure of the preimage is:\n$$\n\\mu(T^{-1}(A)) = \\left( \\frac{b}{2} - \\frac{a}{2} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{b+1}{2} - \\frac{a+1}{2} \\right) = \\frac{b-a}{2} + \\frac{b-a}{2} = b - a = \\mu(A)\n$$\nSince this holds for intervals generating the Borel $\\sigma$-algebra, $T$ preserves the Lebesgue measure.\n\n**2. Proof of Ergodicity via Fourier Series**\nWe utilize the Hilbert space $L^2([0, 1])$ with the orthonormal basis $\\{e^{2\\pi i k x}\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}}$.\nA transformation $T$ is ergodic if and only if the only invariant $L^2$ functions are constants almost everywhere. That is, if $f \\circ T = f$ almost everywhere implies $f$ is constant almost everywhere.\n\nLet $f \\in L^2([0, 1])$ be an invariant function, i.e., $f(T(x)) = f(x)$ for almost every $x$.\nWe expand $f$ in its Fourier series:\n$$\nf(x) = \\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} c_k e^{2\\pi i k x}\n$$\nSubstituting $T(x) = 2x \\pmod 1$:\n$$\nf(T(x)) = f(2x) = \\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} c_k e^{2\\pi i k (2x)} = \\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} c_k e^{2\\pi i (2k) x}\n$$\nSince $f(T(x)) = f(x)$, we equate the Fourier series coefficients:\n$$\n\\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} c_k e^{2\\pi i (2k) x} = \\sum_{m \\in \\mathbb{Z}} c_m e^{2\\pi i m x}\n$$\nBy the uniqueness of Fourier coefficients, the coefficient of $e^{2\\pi i m x}$ on the right-hand side must equal the coefficient of the corresponding term on the left-hand side. The left-hand side only contains frequencies of the form $2k$ (even integers).\n\nThis implies two conditions for the coefficients $c_m$:\n1. If $m$ is odd, the left-hand side has no term with frequency $m$, so $c_m = 0$.\n2. If $m$ is even, say $m = 2k$, the coefficient on the left is $c_k$. Thus, $c_{2k} = c_k$.\n\nNow consider any $m \\neq 0$. We can write $m = 2^j \\cdot l$, where $l$ is an odd integer and $j \\geq 0$. Applying the relation $c_{2k} = c_k$ iteratively $j$ times:\n$$\nc_m = c_{2^j l} = c_{2^{j-1} l} = \\dots = c_l\n$$\nSince $l$ is odd, we established in condition (1) that $c_l = 0$. Therefore:\n$$\nc_m = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } m \\neq 0\n$$\nConsequently, the Fourier series reduces to $f(x) = c_0$. This proves that any invariant function $f$ is constant almost everywhere.\n\nApplying this to characteristic functions: if $A$ is an invariant set (i.e., $T^{-1}(A) = A$ modulo measure zero), then its characteristic function $\\chi_A$ is invariant. By the result above, $\\chi_A$ is constant almost everywhere. Since $\\chi_A$ takes only values 0 and 1, it must be $0$ a.e. or $1$ a.e.\nThus, $\\mu(A) = 0$ or $\\mu(A) = 1$.\n\n**Conclusion:** $T$ is ergodic with respect to $\\mu$.\n\n---\n\n### Part 2: Lyapunov Exponent\n\nThe Lyapunov exponent $\\lambda(T)$ characterizes the rate of separation of infinitesimally close trajectories. For a 1-dimensional map $T$, it is defined as:\n$$\n\\lambda(T) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \\ln |T'(x_i)|\n$$\nwhere $x_i = T^i(x_0)$. By the Birkhoff Ergodic Theorem, since $T$ is ergodic with respect to $\\mu$, this time average equals the space average for $\\mu$-almost every $x$:\n$$\n\\lambda(T) = \\int_0^1 \\ln |T'(x)| \\, d\\mu(x)\n$$\nWe compute the derivative of $T(x)$:\n$$\nT'(x) = \n\\begin{cases} \n2, & \\text{if } 0 < x < \\frac{1}{2} \\\\\n2, & \\text{if } \\frac{1}{2} < x < 1\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe derivative is undefined at $x = 0, \\frac{1}{2}, 1$, which constitutes a set of measure zero and does not affect the integral.\nThus, $|T'(x)| = 2$ almost everywhere.\n\nSubstituting this into the integral:\n$$\n\\lambda(T) = \\int_0^1 \\ln(2) \\, dx = \\ln(2) \\cdot (1 - 0) = \\ln 2\n$$\n\n**Conclusion:** The Lyapunov exponent of $T$ with respect to $\\mu$ is $\\ln 2$.",

Using the definition of $T$:\n$$\nT^{-1}([a, b]) = \\left\\{ x \\in \\left[0, \\frac{1}{2}\\right) : 2x \\in [a, b] \\right\\} \\cup \\left\\{ x \\in \\left[\\frac{1}{2}, 1\\right] : 2x - 1 \\in [a, b] \\right\\}\n$$\n$$\nT^{-1}([a, b]) = \\left[ \\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{b}{2} \\right] \\cup \\left[ \\frac{a+1}{2}, \\frac{b+1}{2} \\right]\n$$\nThese two intervals are disjoint (the first lies in $[0, 0.5]$ and the second in $[0.5, 1]$). The measure of the preimage is:\n$$\n\\mu(T^{-1}(A)) = \\left( \\frac{b}{2} - \\frac{a}{2} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{b+1}{2} - \\frac{a+1}{2} \\right) = \\frac{b-a}{2} + \\frac{b-a}{2} = b - a = \\mu(A)\n$$\nSince this holds for intervals generating the Borel $\\sigma$-algebra, $T$ preserves the Lebesgue measure.\n\n**2. Proof of Ergodicity via Fourier Series**\nWe utilize the Hilbert space $L^2([0, 1])$ with the orthonormal basis $\\{e^{2\\pi i k x}\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}}$.\nA transformation $T$ is ergodic if and only if the only invariant $L^2$ functions are constants almost everywhere. That is, if $f \\circ T = f$ almost everywhere implies $f$ is constant almost everywhere.\n\nLet $f \\in L^2([0, 1])$ be an invariant function, i.e., $f(T(x)) = f(x)$ for almost every $x$.\nWe expand $f$ in its Fourier series:\n$$\nf(x) = \\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} c_k e^{2\\pi i k x}\n$$\nSubstituting $T(x) = 2x \\pmod 1$:\n$$\nf(T(x)) = f(2x) = \\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} c_k e^{2\\pi i k (2x)} = \\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} c_k e^{2\\pi i (2k) x}\n$$\nSince $f(T(x)) = f(x)$, we equate the Fourier series coefficients:\n$$\n\\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} c_k e^{2\\pi i (2k) x} = \\sum_{m \\in \\mathbb{Z}} c_m e^{2\\pi i m x}\n$$\nBy the uniqueness of Fourier coefficients, the coefficient of $e^{2\\pi i m x}$ on the right-hand side must equal the coefficient of the corresponding term on the left-hand side. The left-hand side only contains frequencies of the form $2k$ (even integers).\n\nThis implies two conditions for the coefficients $c_m$:\n1. If $m$ is odd, the left-hand side has no term with frequency $m$, so $c_m = 0$.\n2. If $m$ is even, say $m = 2k$, the coefficient on the left is $c_k$. Thus, $c_{2k} = c_k$.\n\nNow consider any $m \\neq 0$. We can write $m = 2^j \\cdot l$, where $l$ is an odd integer and $j \\geq 0$. Applying the relation $c_{2k} = c_k$ iteratively $j$ times:\n$$\nc_m = c_{2^j l} = c_{2^{j-1} l} = \\dots = c_l\n$$\nSince $l$ is odd, we established in condition (1) that $c_l = 0$. Therefore:\n$$\nc_m = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } m \\neq 0\n$$\nConsequently, the Fourier series reduces to $f(x) = c_0$. This proves that any invariant function $f$ is constant almost everywhere.\n\nApplying this to characteristic functions: if $A$ is an invariant set (i.e., $T^{-1}(A) = A$ modulo measure zero), then its characteristic function $\\chi_A$ is invariant. By the result above, $\\chi_A$ is constant almost everywhere. Since $\\chi_A$ takes only values 0 and 1, it must be $0$ a.e. or $1$ a.e.\nThus, $\\mu(A) = 0$ or $\\mu(A) = 1$.\n\n**Conclusion:** $T$ is ergodic with respect to $\\mu$.\n\n---\n\n### Part 2: Lyapunov Exponent\n\nThe Lyapunov exponent $\\lambda(T)$ characterizes the rate of separation of infinitesimally close trajectories. For a 1-dimensional map $T$, it is defined as:\n$$\n\\lambda(T) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \\ln |T'(x_i)|\n$$\nwhere $x_i = T^i(x_0)$. By the Birkhoff Ergodic Theorem, since $T$ is ergodic with respect to $\\mu$, this time average equals the space average for $\\mu$-almost every $x$:\n$$\n\\lambda(T) = \\int_0^1 \\ln |T'(x)| \\, d\\mu(x)\n$$\nWe compute the derivative of $T(x)$:\n$$\nT'(x) = \n\\begin{cases} \n2, & \\text{if } 0 < x < \\frac{1}{2} \\\\\n2, & \\text{if } \\frac{1}{2} < x < 1\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe derivative is undefined at $x = 0, \\frac{1}{2}, 1$, which constitutes a set of measure zero and does not affect the integral.\nThus, $|T'(x)| = 2$ almost everywhere.\n\nSubstituting this into the integral:\n$$\n\\lambda(T) = \\int_0^1 \\ln(2) \\, dx = \\ln(2) \\cdot (1 - 0) = \\ln 2\n$$\n\n**Conclusion:** The Lyapunov exponent of $T$ with respect to $\\mu$ is $\\ln 2$.",

        "raw_answer": "Here is the complete and rigorous solution to the problem.\n\n### Part 1: Proof that $\\hat{f}$ is an Even Function\n\n**Claim:** If $f \\in \\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ is an even function, i.e., $f(x) = f(-x)$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, then $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\hat{f}(-\\xi)$ for all $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\n**Proof:**\n\nLet $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ be arbitrary. By the definition of the Fourier transform:\n$$\n\\hat{f}(-\\xi) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i \\langle x, -\\xi \\rangle} \\, dx.\n$$\nUsing the linearity of the inner product, $\\langle x, -\\xi \\rangle = -\\langle x, \\xi \\rangle$.

Since this is a linear transformation with determinant $\\det(-I) = (-1)^n$, the Jacobian determinant is $|\\det(-I)| = |-1|^n = 1$. Thus, $dx = dy$. The domain of integration $\\mathbb{R}^n$ remains $\\mathbb{R}^n$.

Two common modifications are:\n\n1.  **Assume $X$ is a Hilbert space and $T$ is a normal operator.**\n    If $T$ is normal ($T^*T = TT^*$), then the spectral radius $r(T)$ equals the operator norm $\\|T\\|$.\n    $$ \\sigma(T) = \\{0\\} \\implies r(T) = 0 \\implies \\|T\\| = 0 \\implies T = 0 $$\n\n2.  **Assume $T$ is diagonalizable.**\n    If $T$ is diagonalizable and all its eigenvalues are $0$, then the diagonal form is the zero matrix, implying $T=0$.",

Euler-Lagrange Formulation and Smoothness Analysis\n\nWe introduce a Lagrange multiplier $\\lambda$ to handle the isoperimetric constraint. We seek to minimize the auxiliary functional:\n$$\nH[y] = \\int_0^1 \\left[ (y')^2 + \\lambda \\sqrt{1 + (y')^2} \\right] \\, dx.\n$$\nThe integrand is $F(y') = (y')^2 + \\lambda \\sqrt{1 + (y')^2}$. Since $F$ depends only on $y'$ and not on $y$ or $x$, the Euler-Lagrange equation simplifies significantly. The equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y'} - \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 0.\n$$\nSince $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 0$, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y'} = 0 \\implies \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y'} = C,\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant. Calculating the derivative:\n$$\n2y' + \\lambda \\frac{y'}{\\sqrt{1 + (y')^2}} = C \\implies y' \\left( 2 + \\frac{\\lambda}{\\sqrt{1 + (y')^2}} \\right) = C.\n$$\nThis is an algebraic equation for $y'(x)$. For a fixed $\\lambda$ and $C$, the solutions for $y'$ are roots of this equation. Consequently, $y'(x)$ must take values from a discrete set of constants.\nFor a **smooth curve** ($y \\in C^1[0, 1]$), $y'(x)$ must be continuous. A continuous function taking values in a discrete set must be constant. Thus, any smooth extremal must be a straight line:\n$$\ny(x) = mx + c.\n$$\nApplying the boundary conditions $y(0)=0$ and $y(1)=1$, we get $c=0$ and $m=1$, so $y(x) = x$.\nWe check the length of this solution:\n$$\nL = \\int_0^1 \\sqrt{1 + 1^2} \\, dx = \\sqrt{2}.\n$$\nHowever, the constraint requires $L=2$. Since $\\sqrt{2} \\neq 2$, no straight line satisfies the constraints.\n\n**Conclusion on Smoothness:** There is **no smooth curve** ($C^1$) that satisfies the boundary conditions, the length constraint, and the Euler-Lagrange equation simultaneously. The problem, as stated for smooth curves, has no solution.\n\n### 2. Solution in the Class of Piecewise Smooth Functions\n\nStandard problems of this type where convexity conditions are violated often have solutions in the class of **broken extremals** (piecewise linear functions). We analyze the problem by minimizing the functional directly using integral inequalities.\n\nLet $u(x) = y'(x)$. We want to minimize $\\int_0^1 u^2 \\, dx$ subject to $\\int_0^1 \\sqrt{1+u^2} \\, dx = 2$.\nLet $v = \\sqrt{1+u^2}$. Then $v \\ge 1$ and $u^2 = v^2 - 1$.\nThe optimization problem becomes:\nMinimize\n$$\n\\int_0^1 (v^2 - 1) \\, dx = \\int_0^1 v^2 \\, dx - 1\n$$\nsubject to\n$$\n\\int_0^1 v \\, dx = 2.\n$$\nBy the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality (or the definition of variance), for any function $v(x)$:\n$$\n\\int_0^1 v^2 \\, dx \\ge \\left( \\int_0^1 v \\, dx \\right)^2 = 2^2 = 4.\n$$\nEquality holds if and only if $v(x)$ is constant almost everywhere.\nThus, the minimum possible value of the functional is $J_{min} = 4 - 1 = 3$.\nThis minimum is achieved if and only if $\\sqrt{1 + (y')^2} = 2$ almost everywhere.\nSquaring gives:\n$$\n1 + (y')^2 = 4 \\implies (y')^2 = 3 \\implies y'(x) = \\pm \\sqrt{3}.\n$$\nTherefore, the magnitude of the slope must be $\\sqrt{3}$ everywhere. To satisfy the boundary conditions, we must mix the slopes $+\\sqrt{3}$ and $-\\sqrt{3}$. This results in a \"sawtooth\" function.\n\n### 3. Construction of the Minimizing Curve\n\nLet $S_+$ be the subset of $[0, 1]$ where $y'(x) = \\sqrt{3}$ and $S_-$ be the subset where $y'(x) = -\\sqrt{3}$. Let $p$ be the total measure (length) of $S_+$. Then the measure of $S_-$ is $1-p$.\nThe boundary condition $\\int_0^1 y' \\, dx = y(1) - y(0) = 1$ implies:\n$$\np(\\sqrt{3}) + (1-p)(-\\sqrt{3}) = 1.\n$$\nSolving for $p$:\n$$\n\\sqrt{3}(2p - 1) = 1 \\implies 2p - 1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\implies p = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{3}}.\n$$\nSince $\\sqrt{3} > 1$, we have $0 < \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} < 1$, so $p \\in (0.5, 1)$, which is a valid proportion.\n\nAny continuous piecewise linear function with slopes $\\pm \\sqrt{3}$ satisfying this proportion $p$ is a solution. A simple example with one peak is:\n1.  Rise with slope $\\sqrt{3}$ for $x \\in [0, p]$.\n2.  Fall with slope $-\\sqrt{3}$ for $x \\in (p, 1]$.\n\nThe peak vertex would be at $(p, p\\sqrt{3})$.\nChecking the endpoint:\n$y(1) = p\\sqrt{3} - (1-p)\\sqrt{3} = (2p-1)\\sqrt{3} = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)\\sqrt{3} = 1$.

Euler-Lagrange Formulation and Smoothness Analysis\n\nWe introduce a Lagrange multiplier $\\lambda$ to handle the isoperimetric constraint. We seek to minimize the auxiliary functional:\n$$\nH[y] = \\int_0^1 \\left[ (y')^2 + \\lambda \\sqrt{1 + (y')^2} \\right] \\, dx.\n$$\nThe integrand is $F(y') = (y')^2 + \\lambda \\sqrt{1 + (y')^2}$. Since $F$ depends only on $y'$ and not on $y$ or $x$, the Euler-Lagrange equation simplifies significantly. The equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y'} - \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 0.\n$$\nSince $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 0$, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y'} = 0 \\implies \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y'} = C,\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant. Calculating the derivative:\n$$\n2y' + \\lambda \\frac{y'}{\\sqrt{1 + (y')^2}} = C \\implies y' \\left( 2 + \\frac{\\lambda}{\\sqrt{1 + (y')^2}} \\right) = C.\n$$\nThis is an algebraic equation for $y'(x)$. For a fixed $\\lambda$ and $C$, the solutions for $y'$ are roots of this equation. Consequently, $y'(x)$ must take values from a discrete set of constants.\nFor a **smooth curve** ($y \\in C^1[0, 1]$), $y'(x)$ must be continuous. A continuous function taking values in a discrete set must be constant. Thus, any smooth extremal must be a straight line:\n$$\ny(x) = mx + c.\n$$\nApplying the boundary conditions $y(0)=0$ and $y(1)=1$, we get $c=0$ and $m=1$, so $y(x) = x$.\nWe check the length of this solution:\n$$\nL = \\int_0^1 \\sqrt{1 + 1^2} \\, dx = \\sqrt{2}.\n$$\nHowever, the constraint requires $L=2$. Since $\\sqrt{2} \\neq 2$, no straight line satisfies the constraints.\n\n**Conclusion on Smoothness:** There is **no smooth curve** ($C^1$) that satisfies the boundary conditions, the length constraint, and the Euler-Lagrange equation simultaneously. The problem, as stated for smooth curves, has no solution.\n\n### 2. Solution in the Class of Piecewise Smooth Functions\n\nStandard problems of this type where convexity conditions are violated often have solutions in the class of **broken extremals** (piecewise linear functions). We analyze the problem by minimizing the functional directly using integral inequalities.\n\nLet $u(x) = y'(x)$. We want to minimize $\\int_0^1 u^2 \\, dx$ subject to $\\int_0^1 \\sqrt{1+u^2} \\, dx = 2$.\nLet $v = \\sqrt{1+u^2}$. Then $v \\ge 1$ and $u^2 = v^2 - 1$.\nThe optimization problem becomes:\nMinimize\n$$\n\\int_0^1 (v^2 - 1) \\, dx = \\int_0^1 v^2 \\, dx - 1\n$$\nsubject to\n$$\n\\int_0^1 v \\, dx = 2.\n$$\nBy the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality (or the definition of variance), for any function $v(x)$:\n$$\n\\int_0^1 v^2 \\, dx \\ge \\left( \\int_0^1 v \\, dx \\right)^2 = 2^2 = 4.\n$$\nEquality holds if and only if $v(x)$ is constant almost everywhere.\nThus, the minimum possible value of the functional is $J_{min} = 4 - 1 = 3$.\nThis minimum is achieved if and only if $\\sqrt{1 + (y')^2} = 2$ almost everywhere.\nSquaring gives:\n$$\n1 + (y')^2 = 4 \\implies (y')^2 = 3 \\implies y'(x) = \\pm \\sqrt{3}.\n$$\nTherefore, the magnitude of the slope must be $\\sqrt{3}$ everywhere. To satisfy the boundary conditions, we must mix the slopes $+\\sqrt{3}$ and $-\\sqrt{3}$. This results in a \"sawtooth\" function.\n\n### 3. Construction of the Minimizing Curve\n\nLet $S_+$ be the subset of $[0, 1]$ where $y'(x) = \\sqrt{3}$ and $S_-$ be the subset where $y'(x) = -\\sqrt{3}$. Let $p$ be the total measure (length) of $S_+$. Then the measure of $S_-$ is $1-p$.\nThe boundary condition $\\int_0^1 y' \\, dx = y(1) - y(0) = 1$ implies:\n$$\np(\\sqrt{3}) + (1-p)(-\\sqrt{3}) = 1.\n$$\nSolving for $p$:\n$$\n\\sqrt{3}(2p - 1) = 1 \\implies 2p - 1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\implies p = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{3}}.\n$$\nSince $\\sqrt{3} > 1$, we have $0 < \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} < 1$, so $p \\in (0.5, 1)$, which is a valid proportion.\n\nAny continuous piecewise linear function with slopes $\\pm \\sqrt{3}$ satisfying this proportion $p$ is a solution. A simple example with one peak is:\n1.  Rise with slope $\\sqrt{3}$ for $x \\in [0, p]$.\n2.  Fall with slope $-\\sqrt{3}$ for $x \\in (p, 1]$.\n\nThe peak vertex would be at $(p, p\\sqrt{3})$.\nChecking the endpoint:\n$y(1) = p\\sqrt{3} - (1-p)\\sqrt{3} = (2p-1)\\sqrt{3} = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)\\sqrt{3} = 1$. (Consistent)\n\nThis solution satisfies the **Weierstrass-Erdmann corner conditions** for broken extremals. Specifically, for the Lagrangian $L = (y')^2 - 4\\sqrt{1+(y')^2}$ (corresponding to $\\lambda = -4$), the quantities $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y'}$ and $L - y'\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y'}$ are continuous across the corners where slope switches between $\\sqrt{3}$ and $-\\sqrt{3}$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe problem is technically ill-posed in the space of smooth ($C^1$) curves, as no such curve exists.

The fundamental group $\\pi_1(M)$ can be computed using the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. The fundamental group of the handlebody $V_1$ is a free group on 2 generators, $\\pi_1(V_1) \\cong F_2 = \\langle a, b \\rangle$.\nThe group $\\pi_1(M)$ is obtained from $\\pi_1(V_1)$ by adding relations corresponding to the boundaries of the meridian disks of $V_2$. Since $V_2$ has genus 2, there are 2 such attaching curves (up to homotopy equivalence of the handlebody structure). Thus, $\\pi_1(M)$ admits a presentation with 2 generators and 2 relations:\n$$ \\pi_1(M) = \\langle a, b \\mid r_1, r_2 \\rangle $$\nThe first homology group $H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z})$ is the abelianization of $\\pi_1(M)$.\n$$ H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\pi_1(M) / [\\pi_1(M), \\pi_1(M)] $$\nThis abelian group is generated by the images of $a$ and $b$.

Thus, $k \\le 2$.

Therefore, we equate the upper limit of the inequality to $z_{0.95}$:\n$$\n\\frac{c - \\mu_Y}{\\sigma_Y} = z_{0.95}\n$$\nSolving for $c$:\n$$\nc = \\mu_Y + \\sigma_Y z_{0.95}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\mu_Y$ and $\\sigma_Y$:\n$$\nc = (a\\mu + b) + |a|\\sigma z_{0.95}\n$$\n*(Note: If we assume $a > 0$, as implied by the parameter values in Part 3, this simplifies to $c = a\\mu + b + a\\sigma z_{0.95}$.)*\n\n**Answer:**\n$$\nc = a\\mu + b + |a|\\sigma z_{0.95}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Part 3: Calculation of $c$\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- $\\mu = 10$\n- $\\sigma^2 = 4 \\implies \\sigma = \\sqrt{4} = 2$ (Standard deviation must be non-negative)\n- $a = 2$\n- $b = 3$\n- $z_{0.95} \\approx 1.645$\n\nFirst, we calculate the mean ($\\mu_Y$) and standard deviation ($\\sigma_Y$) of $Y$:\n$$\n\\mu_Y = a\\mu + b = 2(10) + 3 = 20 + 3 = 23\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_Y = |a|\\sigma = |2|(2) = 2 \\times 2 = 4\n$$\n\nNext, we substitute these into the expression for $c$ derived in Part 2:\n$$\nc = \\mu_Y + \\sigma_Y z_{0.95}\n$$\n$$\nc = 23 + 4(1.645)\n$$\n\nPerform the multiplication:\n$$\n4 \\times 1.645 = 6.58\n$$\n\nPerform the addition:\n$$\nc = 23 + 6.58 = 29.58\n$$\n\n**Answer:**\nThe value of $c$ is **29.58**.",
