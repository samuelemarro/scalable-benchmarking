        "answer": "## Step 1: Prove that $\\sim$ is reflexive\nTo prove that $\\sim$ is reflexive, we need to show that for any $f \\in S$, $f \\sim f$. This means we must find a constant $C$ such that for all $x \\in [0, 1]$, $|f(x) - f(x)| \\leq C \\cdot |x - 0.5|$. Since $|f(x) - f(x)| = 0$, we can choose $C = 0$, and the condition is satisfied because $0 \\leq 0 \\cdot |x - 0.5|$ for all $x$. Thus, $\\sim$ is reflexive.\n\n## Step 2: Prove that $\\sim$ is symmetric\nTo prove that $\\sim$ is symmetric, we need to show that if $f \\sim g$, then $g \\sim f$. Given $f \\sim g$, there exists a $C$ such that $|f(x) - g(x)| \\leq C \\cdot |x - 0.5|$ for all $x \\in [0, 1]$. This implies $|g(x) - f(x)| \\leq C \\cdot |x - 0.5|$ since $|f(x) - g(x)| = |g(x) - f(x)|$. Thus, $g \\sim f$ with the same $C$, proving that $\\sim$ is symmetric.\n\n## Step 3: Prove that $\\sim$ is transitive\nTo prove that $\\sim$ is transitive, we need to show that if $f \\sim g$ and $g \\sim h$, then $f \\sim h$. Given $f \\sim g$, there exists a $C_1$ such that $|f(x) - g(x)| \\leq C_1 \\cdot |x - 0.5|$ for all $x$. Given $g \\sim h$, there exists a $C_2$ such that $|g(x) - h(x)| \\leq C_2 \\cdot |x - 0.5|$ for all $x$. By the triangle inequality, $|f(x) - h(x)| \\leq |f(x) - g(x)| + |g(x) - h(x)| \\leq (C_1 + C_2) \\cdot |x - 0.5|$. Thus, $f \\sim h$ with $C = C_1 + C_2$, proving that $\\sim$ is transitive.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the equivalence class of $f(x) = x$\nTo find the equivalence class of $f(x) = x$, we need to find all $g \\in S$ such that $g \\sim f$. This means $|g(x) - x| \\leq C \\cdot |x - 0.5|$ for some $C$ and all $x \\in [0, 1]$. Thus, $g(x)$ is in the equivalence class of $f(x)$ if $|g(x) - x| \\leq C|x - 0.5|$.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze the condition for $g(x)$ to be in the equivalence class of $f(x) = x$\nFor $x = 0.5$, $|g(0.5) - 0.5| \\leq C \\cdot 0$, which implies $g(0.5) = 0.5$. For $x$ near $0.5$, $g(x)$ is approximately $x$ because $|g(x) - x|$ is bounded by a constant times $|x - 0.5|$, which is small. This condition does not restrict $g(x)$ significantly for $x$ far from $0.5$, but it does imply that $g(x)$ and $x$ are close near $x = 0.5$.\n\n## Step 6: Show that the set of equivalence classes forms a vector space over the reals\nTo show that the set of equivalence classes forms a vector space, we need to define addition and scalar multiplication and verify the vector space axioms. Let $[f]$ denote the equivalence class of $f$. Define $[f] + [g] = [f + g]$ and $c[f] = [cf]$ for $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$. We must verify that these operations are well-defined.\n\n## Step 7: Verify that the operations are well-defined\nFor $[f] + [g] = [f + g]$, if $f \\sim f'$ and $g \\sim g'$, we need to show $f + g \\sim f' + g'$. Since $|f(x) - f'(x)| \\leq C_1|x - 0.5|$ and $|g(x) - g'(x)| \\leq C_2|x - 0.5|$, $|(f + g)(x) - (f' + g')(x)| \\leq (C_1 + C_2)|x - 0.5|$, proving $f + g \\sim f' + g'$. For $c[f] = [cf]$, if $f \\sim g$, then $|cf(x) - cg(x)| = |c||f(x) - g(x)| \\leq |c|C|x - 0.5|$, so $cf \\sim cg$, showing that scalar multiplication is well-defined.\n\n## Step 8: Identify a basis for the vector space of equivalence classes\nThe zero element is $[0]$, the equivalence class of the zero function. For any $f$, $[f] + [-f] = [0]$, showing the existence of additive inverses. To identify a basis, consider that two functions $f$ and $g$ are in the same equivalence class if $|f(x) - g(x)| \\leq C|x - 0.5|$ for some $C$. This suggests that functions differing by a bounded multiple of $|x - 0.5|$ are equivalent.\n\n## Step 9: Further analysis on the basis\nSince any function $f$ can be represented as $f(x) = (f(x) - f(0.5)) + f(0.5)$, and $|f(x) - f(0.5)|$ can be related to $|x - 0.5|$ by some $C$ if $f$ is Lipschitz or has a bounded derivative near $0.5$, the equivalence classes can be related to the value of $f(0.5)$ and the behavior of $f(x) - f(0.5)$ relative to $|x - 0.5|$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

        "answer": "## Step 1: Understand the problem and the function $f(x)$\nThe problem asks us to find the maximum possible value of the sum $\\sum_{x \\in S} f(x)$, where $S$ is a set of $n$ distinct positive integers, and $f(x)$ is the number of elements in $S$ that are divisible by $x$. To maximize $\\sum_{x \\in S} f(x)$, we need to understand how $f(x)$ contributes to the sum. For any $x \\in S$, $f(x)$ counts the number of elements in $S$ that are multiples of $x$.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the contribution of $f(x)$ to the sum\nFor each $x \\in S$, $f(x)$ is at least 1 because $x$ is divisible by itself. The sum $\\sum_{x \\in S} f(x)$ counts the total number of pairs $(x, y)$ where $x, y \\in S$ and $x$ divides $y$. This is because for every $y \\in S$, $f(x)$ is incremented by 1 for each $x \\in S$ that divides $y$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the maximum value of $\\sum_{x \\in S} f(x)$\nTo maximize $\\sum_{x \\in S} f(x)$, we should choose $S$ such that the number of pairs $(x, y)$ where $x$ divides $y$ is maximized. This happens when $S$ contains numbers that are likely to divide many other numbers in $S$. The set $S$ that maximizes this condition is likely to contain small numbers, as they are more likely to be divisors of other numbers.\n\n## Step 4: Examine the structure of $S$ for maximum $\\sum_{x \\in S} f(x)$\nLet's consider $S = \\{1, 2, 4, 8, \\ldots, 2^{n-1}\\}$. In this set, every element is a divisor of the elements that follow it (except for the last element), thus maximizing the count of $f(x)$ for each $x$. For $x = 2^k$, $f(x) = n - k$ because $x$ divides $2^k, 2^{k+1}, \\ldots, 2^{n-1}$, which are $n-k$ elements.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate $\\sum_{x \\in S} f(x)$ for $S = \\{1, 2, 4, 8, \\ldots, 2^{n-1}\\}$\nFor $S = \\{1, 2, 4, \\ldots, 2^{n-1}\\}$, we have:\n- $f(1) = n$ because 1 divides all $n$ elements.\n- $f(2) = n-1$ because 2 divides $n-1$ elements.\n- $f(2^2) = n-2$.\n- ...\n- $f(2^{n-1}) = 1$.\nSo, $\\sum_{x \\in S} f(x) = n + (n-1) + (n-2) + \\ldots + 1 = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} k$.\n\n## Step 6: Compute the sum $\\sum_{k=1}^{n} k$\nThe sum of the first $n$ positive integers is given by the formula $\\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}$.\n\n## Step 7: Validate the choice of $S$\nThe chosen $S = \\{1, 2, 4, \\ldots, 2^{n-1}\\}$ is a set of $n$ distinct positive integers, satisfying the problem's constraints. This set maximizes $\\sum_{x \\in S} f(x)$ because it ensures that every element $x$ in $S$ divides as many other elements as possible.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}}$",
