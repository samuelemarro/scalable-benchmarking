        "answer": "The question asks to prove that every group of order 56 has a normal subgroup of order 7. This statement is **false**; therefore the question is ill\u2011posed because it requires proving a claim that does not hold for all groups of order 56. A concrete counterexample is given below.\n\n---\n\n### Counterexample: a group of order 56 with no normal subgroup of order 7\n\nLet $V = (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$ be the elementary abelian group of order $8$. Its automorphism group is  \n$$\n\\operatorname{Aut}(V) \\cong \\mathrm{GL}(3,2),\n$$  \nwhich has order $168 = 2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7$. By Cauchy\u2019s theorem there exists an element $\\alpha \\in \\operatorname{Aut}(V)$ of order $7$. Moreover, we can choose $\\alpha$ so that it acts **fixed\u2011point\u2011freely** on $V$, i.e. the only vector fixed by $\\alpha$ is the identity $0$. Such an element exists, for instance, as a Singer cycle: identify $V$ with the additive group of the field $\\mathbb{F}_{2^3}$; multiplication by a primitive element of $\\mathbb{F}_{2^3}^{\\times}$ gives an $\\mathbb{F}_2$-linear transformation of order $7$ with no non\u2011zero fixed points.\n\nLet $Q = \\langle q \\rangle$ be a cyclic group of order $7$. Define a homomorphism  \n$$\n\\varphi \\colon Q \\to \\operatorname{Aut}(V),\\qquad \\varphi(q) = \\alpha.\n$$  \nForm the semidirect product  \n$$\nG = V \\rtimes_\\varphi Q.\n$$  \nThen $|G| = |V| \\cdot |Q| = 8 \\cdot 7 = 56$.\n\n---\n\n### Verification that $G$ has no normal subgroup of order $7$\n\nIn $G$, the subgroup $V$ is normal (it is the kernel of the projection onto $Q$). Consider the Sylow $7$-subgroups. By Sylow\u2019s theorems, the number $n_7$ of Sylow $7$-subgroups satisfies  \n$$\nn_7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}, \\qquad n_7 \\mid 8.\n$$  \nHence $n_7$ can only be $1$ or $8$.\n\nWe compute $n_7$ directly in $G$. The normalizer $N_G(Q)$ contains $Q$. Because $V$ is normal, an element $v \\in V$ normalizes $Q$ if and only if  \n$$\nv Q v^{-1} = Q \\;\\Longleftrightarrow\\; \\alpha(v) = v,\n$$  \ni.e. $v$ is fixed by the action of $Q$. Thus  \n$$\nN_G(Q) = V^Q \\rtimes Q,\n$$  \nwhere $V^Q = \\{ v \\in V \\mid \\alpha(v) = v \\}$. By construction $\\alpha$ acts fixed\u2011point\u2011freely, so $V^Q = \\{0\\}$. Consequently $N_G(Q) = Q$ and  \n$$\n[G : N_G(Q)] = \\frac{|G|}{|Q|} = \\frac{56}{7} = 8.\n$$  \nSylow\u2019s theorem also gives $n_7 = [G : N_G(Q)]$, therefore $n_7 = 8$.\n\nSince $n_7 = 8$, the Sylow $7$-subgroup $Q$ is **not** normal, and any subgroup of order $7$ (being a Sylow $7$-subgroup) is conjugate to $Q$. With eight distinct conjugates, none can be normal. Hence $G$ has no normal subgroup of order $7$.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe group $G$ constructed above is a group of order $56$ that does **not** possess a normal subgroup of order $7$. Thus the statement \u201cevery group of order $56$ has a normal subgroup of order $7$\u201d is false, and the question as posed is **ill\u2011posed** (it asks to prove an incorrect claim).  \n\nTo obtain a valid problem, one could instead ask to prove that a group of order $56$ always has a normal Sylow $2$-subgroup **or** a normal Sylow $7$-subgroup (i.e., it is not simple), or impose additional hypotheses (e.g., that the Sylow $2$-subgroup is cyclic) that would force $n_7 = 1$.",

Subtracting gives\n$$\nf_1 - f_2 = (x^2+y^2+z^2-1) - (x^2+y^2 - z) = z^2 + z - 1 = 0.\n$$\nThus every point of $V$ satisfies\n$$\nz^2 + z - 1 = 0.\n$$\nThis quadratic factors as\n$$\n(z - \\alpha)(z - \\beta) = 0,\\quad \\text{where } \\alpha = \\frac{-1+\\sqrt{5}}{2},\\; \\beta = \\frac{-1-\\sqrt{5}}{2}.\n$$\nHence $z$ can only be $\\alpha$ or $\\beta$.\n\nNow take the case $z = \\alpha$. From $f_2=0$ we obtain\n$$\nx^2 + y^2 = \\alpha.\n$$\nConversely, if $z = \\alpha$ and $x^2+y^2 = \\alpha$, then\n$$\nf_1 = \\alpha + \\alpha^2 - 1 = 0\n$$\nbecause $\\alpha$ satisfies $\\alpha^2+\\alpha-1=0$. Thus the point lies in $V$. An identical argument holds for $z = \\beta$. Therefore\n$$\nV = V_\\alpha \\cup V_\\beta,\n$$\nwhere\n$$\nV_\\alpha = \\{(x,y,z)\\in\\mathbb{C}^3 \\mid z = \\alpha,\\; x^2+y^2 = \\alpha\\},\n$$\n$$\nV_\\beta = \\{(x,y,z)\\in\\mathbb{C}^3 \\mid z = \\beta,\\; x^2+y^2 = \\beta\\}.\n$$\n\n### 2. Irreducibility of the components\nConsider the ideal\n$$\nJ_\\alpha = \\langle z - \\alpha,\\; x^2 + y^2 - \\alpha \\rangle \\subset \\mathbb{C}[x,y,z].\n$$\nThe quotient\n$$\n\\mathbb{C}[x,y,z]/J_\\alpha \\cong \\mathbb{C}[x,y]/\\langle x^2 + y^2 - \\alpha \\rangle\n$$\nis an integral domain if and only if the polynomial $x^2 + y^2 - \\alpha$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{C}$.\n\n*Proof of irreducibility:*  \nIf $\\alpha \\neq 0$, the polynomial $x^2 + y^2 - \\alpha$ is irreducible. Indeed, its homogenisation $X^2 + Y^2 - \\alpha Z^2$ defines a smooth conic in $\\mathbb{P}^2_{\\mathbb{C}}$ (the partial derivatives vanish only at $(0,0,0)$, which is not a point of the projective variety). A smooth projective conic is irreducible. Hence $x^2 + y^2 - \\alpha$ is irreducible in the affine case as well. Since $\\alpha = (-1+\\sqrt{5})/2 \\neq 0$ (and similarly $\\beta \\neq 0$), both polynomials are irreducible.\n\nThus $J_\\alpha$ is a prime ideal, and consequently $V_\\alpha = \\mathbf{V}(J_\\alpha)$ is an irreducible affine variety. The same holds for $V_\\beta$. Moreover, $\\alpha \\neq \\beta$ implies $V_\\alpha \\cap V_\\beta = \\varnothing$. Therefore $V$ is the union of two distinct irreducible components $V_\\alpha$ and $V_\\beta$.\n\n### 3. Dimension\nThe coordinate ring of $V_\\alpha$ is\n$$\n\\mathbb{C}[x,y,z]/J_\\alpha \\cong \\mathbb{C}[x,y]/\\langle x^2 + y^2 - \\alpha \\rangle.\n$$\nSince $x^2 + y^2 - \\alpha$ is a non\u2011constant irreducible polynomial in two variables, the Krull dimension of this ring is $1$. Hence $\\dim V_\\alpha = 1$. The same reasoning gives $\\dim V_\\beta = 1$. The dimension of a reducible variety is the maximum of the dimensions of its components, so\n$$\n\\dim V = 1.\n$$\n\n### 4.

Preliminaries and the closed subgroup theorem\n\nLet $\\mathfrak{g} = T_eG$ be the Lie algebra of $G$. Because $H$ is a closed subgroup of $G$, **Cartan\u2019s closed subgroup theorem** asserts that $H$ is an embedded Lie subgroup of $G$. In particular:\n\n* $H$ is a submanifold of $G$;\n* its Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{h} = T_eH$ is a Lie subalgebra of $\\mathfrak{g}$;\n* $\\dim H = \\dim \\mathfrak{h}$.\n\nThis theorem is fundamental; its proof uses the exponential map to show that near the identity, $H$ coincides with $\\exp(U \\cap \\mathfrak{h})$ for some neighbourhood $U$ of $0$ in $\\mathfrak{g}$. We shall rely on this result.\n\n### 2. Choice of a complementary subspace\n\nSince $\\mathfrak{h}$ is a linear subspace of $\\mathfrak{g}$, we can choose a vector subspace $\\mathfrak{m} \\subset \\mathfrak{g}$ such that\n$$\n\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathfrak{h} \\oplus \\mathfrak{m} \\quad \\text{(direct sum)}.\n$$\nThen $\\dim \\mathfrak{m} = \\dim \\mathfrak{g} - \\dim \\mathfrak{h} = \\dim G - \\dim H$.\n\n### 3. A local diffeomorphism\n\nConsider the smooth map\n$$\n\\Phi : \\mathfrak{m} \\times H \\longrightarrow G,\\qquad \\Phi(X, h) = \\exp(X)\\, h.\n$$\nCompute its differential at $(0, e)$. Identify $T_0\\mathfrak{m} \\cong \\mathfrak{m}$, $T_eH \\cong \\mathfrak{h}$, and $T_eG \\cong \\mathfrak{g}$. For $(Y, Z) \\in \\mathfrak{m} \\times \\mathfrak{h}$ we have\n$$\nd\\Phi_{(0,e)}(Y, Z) = \\left.\\frac{d}{dt}\\right|_{t=0} \\exp(tY)\\, \\exp(tZ) = Y + Z,\n$$\nbecause the derivative of $\\exp$ at $0$ is the identity and right multiplication by $e$ does not change the tangent vector. Since $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathfrak{h} \\oplus \\mathfrak{m}$, the map $(Y, Z) \\mapsto Y+Z$ is an isomorphism. Hence $d\\Phi_{(0,e)}$ is an isomorphism.\n\nBy the **Inverse Function Theorem**, there exist open neighbourhoods $\\widetilde{U} \\subset \\mathfrak{m}$ of $0$, $V \\subset H$ of $e$, and $W \\subset G$ of $e$ such that\n$$\n\\Phi|_{\\widetilde{U} \\times V} : \\widetilde{U} \\times V \\longrightarrow W\n$$\nis a diffeomorphism. Moreover, because $\\exp$ is a local diffeomorphism at $0$, we may shrink $\\widetilde{U}$ to a smaller neighbourhood $U \\subset \\widetilde{U}$ of $0$ so that $\\exp|_U : U \\to \\exp(U)$ is also a diffeomorphism and $\\exp(U) \\subset W$. Then, after possibly shrinking $U$ further, we can ensure that for all $X_1, X_2 \\in U$ and $h \\in H$ with $\\exp(X_1) = \\exp(X_2) h$ we have $h \\in V$. This will be used to prove injectivity of the chart map.\n\n### 4. Constructing a chart at the identity coset\n\nLet $\\pi : G \\to G/H$ be the canonical projection $g \\mapsto gH$. Define\n$$\n\\psi : U \\longrightarrow G/H,\\qquad \\psi(X) = \\pi(\\exp(X)) = \\exp(X)H.\n$$\n\n* **Injectivity.** Suppose $\\psi(X_1) = \\psi(X_2)$ for $X_1, X_2 \\in U$. Then $\\exp(X_1)H = \\exp(X_2)H$, so there exists $h \\in H$ with $\\exp(X_1) = \\exp(X_2) h$. By our choice of $U$, we have $h \\in V$. Then $\\Phi(X_2, h) = \\exp(X_2)h = \\exp(X_1) = \\Phi(X_1, e)$. Since $\\Phi$ is injective on $U \\times V$, we obtain $X_1 = X_2$ and $h = e$. Hence $\\psi$ is injective.\n\n* **Continuity and openness.** The map $\\psi$ is continuous because $\\exp$ and $\\pi$ are continuous. The projection $\\pi$ is open (for any open set $O \\subset G$, $\\pi^{-1}(\\pi(O)) = O H$ is a union of right translates, each open, so $\\pi(O)$ is open). Since $\\exp|_U$ is a homeomorphism onto its image, $\\psi(U) = \\pi(\\exp(U))$ is open in $G/H$. Moreover, the restriction $\\psi : U \\to \\psi(U)$ is a homeomorphism (its inverse is given by $\\psi^{-1}(\\exp(X)H) = X$, which is continuous because locally it can be expressed as the composition of a smooth local section of $\\pi$).\n\nThus $(U, \\psi)$ is a coordinate chart around the point $eH \\in G/H$.\n\n### 5. Extending to an atlas\n\nFor an arbitrary coset $gH \\in G/H$, use left translation. The map\n$$\nL_g : G \\longrightarrow G,\\quad x \\mapsto gx\n$$\nis a diffeomorphism. It descends to a homeomorphism\n$$\n\\tau_g : G/H \\longrightarrow G/H,\\quad \\tau_g(xH) = gxH.\n$$\nDefine the chart around $gH$ by\n$$\n\\psi_g : U \\longrightarrow G/H,\\qquad \\psi_g(X) = \\tau_g(\\psi(X)) = g\\exp(X)H.\n$$\nBecause $\\tau_g$ is a homeomorphism and $\\psi$ is a homeomorphism onto its image, $\\psi_g$ is a homeomorphism from $U$ onto the open neighbourhood $\\tau_g(\\psi(U))$ of $gH$.\n\n### 6. Smoothness of transition maps\n\nTake two such charts $(U, \\psi_g)$ and $(U, \\psi_{g'})$ with non\u2011empty overlap. For $X, Y \\in U$ such that $\\psi_g(X) = \\psi_{g'}(Y)$, we have\n$$\ng\\exp(X)H = g'\\exp(Y)H \\quad\\Longleftrightarrow\\quad (g')^{-1}g\\exp(X) \\in \\exp(Y)H.\n$$\nSet $a = (g')^{-1}g \\in G$. Then there exists a unique $h \\in H$ (close to $e$) satisfying\n$$\na\\exp(X) = \\exp(Y) h.\n$$\nBecause $\\Phi$ is a diffeomorphism on $U \\times V$, we can solve for $Y$ and $h$ smoothly in terms of $X$. More precisely, consider the smooth map\n$$\nF : U \\longrightarrow G,\\quad F(X) = a\\exp(X).\n$$\nFor $X$ sufficiently close to $0$, $F(X)$ lies in the neighbourhood $W$ where $\\Phi^{-1}$ is defined. Then\n$$\n\\Phi^{-1}(F(X)) = (Y(X),\\, h(X)) \\in U \\times V,\n$$\nwith $Y(X)$ and $h(X)$ depending smoothly on $X$. The transition map from the chart $\\psi_g$ to $\\psi_{g'}$ is precisely $X \\mapsto Y(X)$. Since $\\Phi^{-1}$ is smooth, $Y(X)$ is smooth. Consequently, the transition maps are smooth, and the collection $\\{(U, \\psi_g)\\}_{g\\in G}$ forms a smooth atlas on $G/H$.\n\n### 7. Topological properties\n\n* **Second countability.** $G$ is a manifold, hence second countable. The projection $\\pi$ is open and surjective. If $\\mathcal{B}$ is a countable base for $G$, then $\\{\\pi(B) : B \\in \\mathcal{B}\\}$ is a countable base for $G/H$ (any open set in $G/H$ is the image of its preimage, which is a union of sets from $\\mathcal{B}$, and the image of that union equals the union of the images). Thus $G/H$ is second countable.\n\n* **Hausdorff.** Because $H$ is closed, the quotient $G/H$ is Hausdorff. (Standard argument: if $g_1H \\neq g_2H$, then $g_2^{-1}g_1 \\notin H$. Since $H$ is closed, there exists a neighbourhood $U$ of $e$ such that $U g_2^{-1}g_1 \\cap H = \\emptyset$. Then the neighbourhoods $\\pi(g_1U)$ and $\\pi(g_2U)$ separate the two cosets.)\n\nThese properties, together with the smooth atlas, show that $G/H$ is a smooth manifold.\n\n### 8. Dimension\n\nThe charts $(U, \\psi_g)$ map an open subset of $\\mathfrak{m}$ (which is a vector space of dimension $\\dim \\mathfrak{m} = \\dim \\mathfrak{g} - \\dim \\mathfrak{h}$) diffeomorphically onto an open set of $G/H$. Hence the local dimension of $G/H$ is $\\dim \\mathfrak{m} = \\dim G - \\dim H$.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion.** The quotient space $G/H$ is a smooth manifold, and its dimension is $\\dim G - \\dim H$.",

Solving the ODE\n\nEquation (1) is a linear non\u2011homogeneous second\u2011order ODE.  \n**Homogeneous solution:** $y_h'' - y_h = 0$ has characteristic equation $r^2-1=0$, so $r = \\pm 1$. Thus\n\n$$\ny_h(x) = A e^{x} + B e^{-x}, \\quad A,B \\in \\mathbb{R}.\n$$\n\n**Particular solution:** Because the right\u2011hand side is $-x$, a polynomial of degree one, we try $y_p(x) = Cx + D$. Then $y_p' = C$, $y_p'' = 0$. Substituting into (1):\n\n$$\n0 - (Cx + D) = -x \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad -Cx - D = -x.\n$$\n\nMatching coefficients yields $-C = -1$ and $-D = 0$, so $C = 1$, $D = 0$. Hence $y_p(x) = x$.\n\nThe general solution is\n\n$$\ny(x) = y_h(x) + y_p(x) = x + A e^{x} + B e^{-x}. \\tag{2}\n$$\n\n### 3. Applying the boundary conditions\n\n- $y(0) = 0$:  \n  $0 = 0 + A e^{0} + B e^{0} = A + B \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad A + B = 0$. \\tag{3}\n- $y(1) = 1$:  \n  $1 = 1 + A e^{1} + B e^{-1} \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad A e + B e^{-1} = 0$. \\tag{4}\n\nFrom (3), $B = -A$. Insert into (4):\n\n$$\nA e + (-A) e^{-1} = A(e - e^{-1}) = 0.\n$$\n\nSince $e - e^{-1} \\neq 0$, we must have $A = 0$. Then $B = 0$ as well.\n\nThus the only function of the form (2) satisfying the boundary conditions is\n\n$$\ny(x) = x.\n$$\n\n### 4. Verification that $y(x)=x$ is indeed the minimizer\n\nWe have found a stationary point of the functional. To confirm it gives a global minimum, note that the integrand $L = (y')^2 + (y-x)^2$ is **strictly convex** in the variables $(y,y')$ for each fixed $x$: its Hessian matrix\n\n$$\n\\nabla^2 L = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial^2 L}{\\partial y^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 L}{\\partial y \\partial y'} \\$$2mm] \\frac{\\partial^2 L}{\\partial y' \\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial^2 L}{\\partial y'^2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nis positive definite. Consequently, the functional $J$ is strictly convex on the space of admissible functions, and any stationary point is the unique global minimizer.\n\nAlternatively, a direct inequality shows that $J[y] \\ge 1$ for every admissible $y$, with equality only for $y(x)=x$. Indeed, by the boundary conditions and the Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality,\n\n$$\n1 = \\bigl( y(1)-y(0) \\bigr)^2 = \\left( \\int_0^1 y'(x)\\,dx \\right)^2 \\le \\int_0^1 1^2\\,dx \\cdot \\int_0^1 y'(x)^2\\,dx = \\int_0^1 y'(x)^2\\,dx.\n$$\n\nThus $\\int_0^1 y'(x)^2\\,dx \\ge 1$. Since $(y(x)-x)^2 \\ge 0$, we obtain\n\n$$\nJ[y] = \\int_0^1 y'(x)^2\\,dx + \\int_0^1 (y(x)-x)^2\\,dx \\ge 1.\n$$\n\nEquality holds iff simultaneously $\\int_0^1 y'(x)^2\\,dx = 1$ and $\\int_0^1 (y(x)-x)^2\\,dx = 0$. The first condition, together with the equality case of Cauchy\u2013Schwarz, forces $y'(x)$ to be constant almost everywhere; because the integral of $y'$ is $1$, that constant must be $1$.

Solving the ODE\n\nEquation (1) is a linear non\u2011homogeneous second\u2011order ODE.  \n**Homogeneous solution:** \\(y_h'' - y_h = 0\\) has characteristic equation \\(r^2-1=0\\), so \\(r = \\pm 1\\). Thus\n\n\\[\ny_h(x) = A e^{x} + B e^{-x}, \\quad A,B \\in \\mathbb{R}.\n\\]\n\n**Particular solution:** Because the right\u2011hand side is \\(-x\\), a polynomial of degree one, we try \\(y_p(x) = Cx + D\\). Then \\(y_p' = C\\), \\(y_p'' = 0\\). Substituting into (1):\n\n\\[\n0 - (Cx + D) = -x \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad -Cx - D = -x.\n\\]\n\nMatching coefficients yields \\(-C = -1\\) and \\(-D = 0\\), so \\(C = 1\\), \\(D = 0\\). Hence \\(y_p(x) = x\\).\n\nThe general solution is\n\n\\[\ny(x) = y_h(x) + y_p(x) = x + A e^{x} + B e^{-x}. \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\n### 3. Applying the boundary conditions\n\n- \\(y(0) = 0\\):  \n  \\(0 = 0 + A e^{0} + B e^{0} = A + B \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad A + B = 0\\). \\tag{3}\n- \\(y(1) = 1\\):  \n  \\(1 = 1 + A e^{1} + B e^{-1} \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad A e + B e^{-1} = 0\\). \\tag{4}\n\nFrom (3), \\(B = -A\\). Insert into (4):\n\n\\[\nA e + (-A) e^{-1} = A(e - e^{-1}) = 0.\n\\]\n\nSince \\(e - e^{-1} \\neq 0\\), we must have \\(A = 0\\). Then \\(B = 0\\) as well.\n\nThus the only function of the form (2) satisfying the boundary conditions is\n\n\\[\ny(x) = x.\n\\]\n\n### 4. Verification that \\(y(x)=x\\) is indeed the minimizer\n\nWe have found a stationary point of the functional. To confirm it gives a global minimum, note that the integrand \\(L = (y')^2 + (y-x)^2\\) is **strictly convex** in the variables \\((y,y')\\) for each fixed \\(x\\): its Hessian matrix\n\n\\[\n\\nabla^2 L = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial^2 L}{\\partial y^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 L}{\\partial y \\partial y'} \\\\[2mm] \\frac{\\partial^2 L}{\\partial y' \\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial^2 L}{\\partial y'^2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nis positive definite. Consequently, the functional \\(J\\) is strictly convex on the space of admissible functions, and any stationary point is the unique global minimizer.\n\nAlternatively, a direct inequality shows that \\(J[y] \\ge 1\\) for every admissible \\(y\\), with equality only for \\(y(x)=x\\). Indeed, by the boundary conditions and the Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality,\n\n\\[\n1 = \\bigl( y(1)-y(0) \\bigr)^2 = \\left( \\int_0^1 y'(x)\\,dx \\right)^2 \\le \\int_0^1 1^2\\,dx \\cdot \\int_0^1 y'(x)^2\\,dx = \\int_0^1 y'(x)^2\\,dx.\n\\]\n\nThus \\(\\int_0^1 y'(x)^2\\,dx \\ge 1\\). Since \\((y(x)-x)^2 \\ge 0\\), we obtain\n\n\\[\nJ[y] = \\int_0^1 y'(x)^2\\,dx + \\int_0^1 (y(x)-x)^2\\,dx \\ge 1.\n\\]\n\nEquality holds iff simultaneously \\(\\int_0^1 y'(x)^2\\,dx = 1\\) and \\(\\int_0^1 (y(x)-x)^2\\,dx = 0\\). The first condition, together with the equality case of Cauchy\u2013Schwarz, forces \\(y'(x)\\) to be constant almost everywhere; because the integral of \\(y'\\) is \\(1\\), that constant must be \\(1\\). Hence \\(y'(x)=1\\) a.e., and together with \\(y(0)=0\\) we get \\(y(x)=x\\) for all \\(x\\) (by continuity). The second condition then also gives \\(y(x)=x\\) for all \\(x\\). Therefore \\(y(x)=x\\) is the unique minimizer.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe function that minimizes \\(J[y]\\) under the given boundary conditions is\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{y(x) = x}.\n\\]",

Applying Stokes\u2019 theorem to the compact manifold \\(S^2\\) (which has no boundary) gives  \n\\[\n\\int_{S^2} \\omega = \\int_{S^2} d\\alpha = \\int_{\\partial S^2} \\alpha = 0.\n\\]  \nHowever, the integral of the volume form over \\(S^2\\) is the surface area:  \n\\[\n\\int_{S^2} \\omega = 4\\pi \\neq 0.\n\\]  \nThis contradiction shows that \\(\\omega\\) is **not** exact. Hence the claim fails for the simply connected manifold \\(S^2\\).\n\n### Correct Statement\nThe well\u2011known result is that on a **simply connected** manifold, every **closed 1\u2011form** is exact (the Poincar\u00e9 lemma for simply connected spaces). For forms of higher degree, simple connectivity does **not** imply exactness; one needs stronger topological conditions such as contractibility (which yields the full Poincar\u00e9 lemma: on a contractible manifold every closed form is exact) or the vanishing of the corresponding de Rham cohomology group \\(H^k_{\\text{dR}}(M)\\).\n\n### Conclusion\nBecause the question asks to prove a statement that is not generally true, it is ill\u2011posed. To make it answerable, one would need to either replace \u201csimply connected\u201d with \u201ccontractible\u201d (or \u201cwith trivial second de Rham cohomology\u201d) or change the degree of the form to 1. As written, the question cannot be answered correctly.",

This yields a partition $0 = x_0 < x_1 < \\cdots < x_n = 1$ with mesh $1/n < \\delta$. For each subinterval $[x_{i-1},x_i]$ we have\n\\[\n\\left|\\int_{x_{i-1}}^{x_i} f(x)\\,dx\\right| = |F(x_i) - F(x_{i-1})| < \\epsilon.\n\\]\n\nThus the required partition exists for every $\\epsilon > 0$. $\\square$\n\n(Note that the hypothesis $\\int_0^1 f = 0$ is not actually needed for this argument; the conclusion holds for any Lebesgue integrable $f$ on $[0,1]$.)",
