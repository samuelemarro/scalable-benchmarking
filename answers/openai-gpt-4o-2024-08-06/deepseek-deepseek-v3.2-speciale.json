        "answer": "The question asks to prove that every group of order 56 has a normal subgroup of order 7. This statement is **false**; therefore the question is ill\u2011posed because it requires proving a claim that does not hold for all groups of order 56. A concrete counterexample is given below.\n\n---\n\n### Counterexample: a group of order 56 with no normal subgroup of order 7\n\nLet $V = (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$ be the elementary abelian group of order $8$. Its automorphism group is  \n$$\n\\operatorname{Aut}(V) \\cong \\mathrm{GL}(3,2),\n$$  \nwhich has order $168 = 2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7$. By Cauchy\u2019s theorem there exists an element $\\alpha \\in \\operatorname{Aut}(V)$ of order $7$. Moreover, we can choose $\\alpha$ so that it acts **fixed\u2011point\u2011freely** on $V$, i.e. the only vector fixed by $\\alpha$ is the identity $0$. Such an element exists, for instance, as a Singer cycle: identify $V$ with the additive group of the field $\\mathbb{F}_{2^3}$; multiplication by a primitive element of $\\mathbb{F}_{2^3}^{\\times}$ gives an $\\mathbb{F}_2$-linear transformation of order $7$ with no non\u2011zero fixed points.\n\nLet $Q = \\langle q \\rangle$ be a cyclic group of order $7$. Define a homomorphism  \n$$\n\\varphi \\colon Q \\to \\operatorname{Aut}(V),\\qquad \\varphi(q) = \\alpha.\n$$  \nForm the semidirect product  \n$$\nG = V \\rtimes_\\varphi Q.\n$$  \nThen $|G| = |V| \\cdot |Q| = 8 \\cdot 7 = 56$.\n\n---\n\n### Verification that $G$ has no normal subgroup of order $7$\n\nIn $G$, the subgroup $V$ is normal (it is the kernel of the projection onto $Q$). Consider the Sylow $7$-subgroups. By Sylow\u2019s theorems, the number $n_7$ of Sylow $7$-subgroups satisfies  \n$$\nn_7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}, \\qquad n_7 \\mid 8.\n$$  \nHence $n_7$ can only be $1$ or $8$.\n\nWe compute $n_7$ directly in $G$. The normalizer $N_G(Q)$ contains $Q$. Because $V$ is normal, an element $v \\in V$ normalizes $Q$ if and only if  \n$$\nv Q v^{-1} = Q \\;\\Longleftrightarrow\\; \\alpha(v) = v,\n$$  \ni.e. $v$ is fixed by the action of $Q$. Thus  \n$$\nN_G(Q) = V^Q \\rtimes Q,\n$$  \nwhere $V^Q = \\{ v \\in V \\mid \\alpha(v) = v \\}$. By construction $\\alpha$ acts fixed\u2011point\u2011freely, so $V^Q = \\{0\\}$. Consequently $N_G(Q) = Q$ and  \n$$\n[G : N_G(Q)] = \\frac{|G|}{|Q|} = \\frac{56}{7} = 8.\n$$  \nSylow\u2019s theorem also gives $n_7 = [G : N_G(Q)]$, therefore $n_7 = 8$.\n\nSince $n_7 = 8$, the Sylow $7$-subgroup $Q$ is **not** normal, and any subgroup of order $7$ (being a Sylow $7$-subgroup) is conjugate to $Q$. With eight distinct conjugates, none can be normal. Hence $G$ has no normal subgroup of order $7$.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe group $G$ constructed above is a group of order $56$ that does **not** possess a normal subgroup of order $7$. Thus the statement \u201cevery group of order $56$ has a normal subgroup of order $7$\u201d is false, and the question as posed is **ill\u2011posed** (it asks to prove an incorrect claim).  \n\nTo obtain a valid problem, one could instead ask to prove that a group of order $56$ always has a normal Sylow $2$-subgroup **or** a normal Sylow $7$-subgroup (i.e., it is not simple), or impose additional hypotheses (e.g., that the Sylow $2$-subgroup is cyclic) that would force $n_7 = 1$.",

Thus the point lies in $V$. An identical argument holds for $z = \\beta$.

Indeed, its homogenisation $X^2 + Y^2 - \\alpha Z^2$ defines a smooth conic in $\\mathbb{P}^2_{\\mathbb{C}}$ (the partial derivatives vanish only at $(0,0,0)$, which is not a point of the projective variety). A smooth projective conic is irreducible. Hence $x^2 + y^2 - \\alpha$ is irreducible in the affine case as well. Since $\\alpha = (-1+\\sqrt{5})/2 \\neq 0$ (and similarly $\\beta \\neq 0$), both polynomials are irreducible.\n\nThus $J_\\alpha$ is a prime ideal, and consequently $V_\\alpha = \\mathbf{V}(J_\\alpha)$ is an irreducible affine variety.

Dimension\nThe coordinate ring of $V_\\alpha$ is\n$$\n\\mathbb{C}[x,y,z]/J_\\alpha \\cong \\mathbb{C}[x,y]/\\langle x^2 + y^2 - \\alpha \\rangle.\n$$\nSince $x^2 + y^2 - \\alpha$ is a non\u2011constant irreducible polynomial in two variables, the Krull dimension of this ring is $1$.

By definition there exist finite families \\(\\{a_i\\}_{i=1}^{m}\\subseteq I\\), \\(\\{b_i\\}_{i=1}^{m}\\subseteq J\\) and \\(\\{c_j\\}_{j=1}^{n}\\subseteq I\\), \\(\\{d_j\\}_{j=1}^{n}\\subseteq J\\) such that\n   \\[\n   x = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} a_i b_i, \\qquad y = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} c_j d_j.\n   \\]\n   Then\n   \\[\n   x + y = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} a_i b_i + \\sum_{j=1}^{n} c_j d_j,\n   \\]\n   which is again a finite sum of elements of the form \\(ab\\) with \\(a\\in I\\), \\(b\\in J\\). Hence \\(x+y\\in IJ\\).\n\n3. **Additive inverses.**  \n   Take \\(x = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} a_i b_i \\in IJ\\). Because \\(I\\) is an ideal, it is in particular an additive subgroup, so \\(-a_i\\in I\\) for each \\(i\\). Then\n   \\[\n   -x = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} (-a_i) b_i\n   \\]\n   is a finite sum of products with \\((-a_i)\\in I\\) and \\(b_i\\in J\\); therefore \\(-x\\in IJ\\).\n\n   (One could also note that \\(-1\\in R\\) and use the closure under multiplication proved below, but the direct argument above is self\u2011contained.)\n\n4. **Closure under multiplication by ring elements.**  \n   Let \\(r\\in R\\) and \\(x = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} a_i b_i \\in IJ\\). Then\n   \\[\n   r x = r\\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{m} a_i b_i \\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} (r a_i) b_i.\n   \\]\n   Since \\(I\\) is an ideal, \\(r a_i \\in I\\) for every \\(i\\). Consequently each term \\((r a_i)b_i\\) is of the form \\(a'b\\) with \\(a'\\in I\\), \\(b\\in J\\), and the sum is finite, so \\(r x \\in IJ\\). Because \\(R\\) is commutative, we also have \\(x r = r x \\in IJ\\); thus \\(IJ\\) absorbs multiplication from either side.\n\n5. **Conclusion.**  \n   We have shown that \\(IJ\\) contains the zero element, is closed under addition, contains additive inverses (hence is an additive subgroup), and is closed under multiplication by arbitrary elements of \\(R\\). Therefore \\(IJ\\) is an ideal of \\(R\\). \u220e\n\n---\n\n**Remark.** It is worth noting that each product \\(ab\\) (\\(a\\in I, b\\in J\\)) lies in both \\(I\\) and \\(J\\) because ideals absorb multiplication: \\(ab\\in I\\) (since \\(a\\in I\\) and \\(b\\in R\\)) and \\(ab\\in J\\) (since \\(b\\in J\\) and \\(a\\in R\\)). Hence every finite sum of such products belongs to \\(I\\cap J\\), so \\(IJ \\subseteq I\\cap J\\). This fact, although not required for the proof, provides additional context.",

Preliminaries and the closed subgroup theorem\n\nLet $\\mathfrak{g} = T_eG$ be the Lie algebra of $G$. Because $H$ is a closed subgroup of $G$, **Cartan\u2019s closed subgroup theorem** asserts that $H$ is an embedded Lie subgroup of $G$. In particular:\n\n* $H$ is a submanifold of $G$;\n* its Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{h} = T_eH$ is a Lie subalgebra of $\\mathfrak{g}$;\n* $\\dim H = \\dim \\mathfrak{h}$.\n\nThis theorem is fundamental; its proof uses the exponential map to show that near the identity, $H$ coincides with $\\exp(U \\cap \\mathfrak{h})$ for some neighbourhood $U$ of $0$ in $\\mathfrak{g}$. We shall rely on this result.\n\n### 2. Choice of a complementary subspace\n\nSince $\\mathfrak{h}$ is a linear subspace of $\\mathfrak{g}$, we can choose a vector subspace $\\mathfrak{m} \\subset \\mathfrak{g}$ such that\n$$\n\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathfrak{h} \\oplus \\mathfrak{m} \\quad \\text{(direct sum)}.\n$$\nThen $\\dim \\mathfrak{m} = \\dim \\mathfrak{g} - \\dim \\mathfrak{h} = \\dim G - \\dim H$.\n\n### 3. A local diffeomorphism\n\nConsider the smooth map\n$$\n\\Phi : \\mathfrak{m} \\times H \\longrightarrow G,\\qquad \\Phi(X, h) = \\exp(X)\\, h.\n$$\nCompute its differential at $(0, e)$. Identify $T_0\\mathfrak{m} \\cong \\mathfrak{m}$, $T_eH \\cong \\mathfrak{h}$, and $T_eG \\cong \\mathfrak{g}$. For $(Y, Z) \\in \\mathfrak{m} \\times \\mathfrak{h}$ we have\n$$\nd\\Phi_{(0,e)}(Y, Z) = \\left.\\frac{d}{dt}\\right|_{t=0} \\exp(tY)\\, \\exp(tZ) = Y + Z,\n$$\nbecause the derivative of $\\exp$ at $0$ is the identity and right multiplication by $e$ does not change the tangent vector. Since $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathfrak{h} \\oplus \\mathfrak{m}$, the map $(Y, Z) \\mapsto Y+Z$ is an isomorphism. Hence $d\\Phi_{(0,e)}$ is an isomorphism.\n\nBy the **Inverse Function Theorem**, there exist open neighbourhoods $\\widetilde{U} \\subset \\mathfrak{m}$ of $0$, $V \\subset H$ of $e$, and $W \\subset G$ of $e$ such that\n$$\n\\Phi|_{\\widetilde{U} \\times V} : \\widetilde{U} \\times V \\longrightarrow W\n$$\nis a diffeomorphism. Moreover, because $\\exp$ is a local diffeomorphism at $0$, we may shrink $\\widetilde{U}$ to a smaller neighbourhood $U \\subset \\widetilde{U}$ of $0$ so that $\\exp|_U : U \\to \\exp(U)$ is also a diffeomorphism and $\\exp(U) \\subset W$. Then, after possibly shrinking $U$ further, we can ensure that for all $X_1, X_2 \\in U$ and $h \\in H$ with $\\exp(X_1) = \\exp(X_2) h$ we have $h \\in V$. This will be used to prove injectivity of the chart map.\n\n### 4. Constructing a chart at the identity coset\n\nLet $\\pi : G \\to G/H$ be the canonical projection $g \\mapsto gH$. Define\n$$\n\\psi : U \\longrightarrow G/H,\\qquad \\psi(X) = \\pi(\\exp(X)) = \\exp(X)H.\n$$\n\n* **Injectivity.** Suppose $\\psi(X_1) = \\psi(X_2)$ for $X_1, X_2 \\in U$. Then $\\exp(X_1)H = \\exp(X_2)H$, so there exists $h \\in H$ with $\\exp(X_1) = \\exp(X_2) h$. By our choice of $U$, we have $h \\in V$. Then $\\Phi(X_2, h) = \\exp(X_2)h = \\exp(X_1) = \\Phi(X_1, e)$. Since $\\Phi$ is injective on $U \\times V$, we obtain $X_1 = X_2$ and $h = e$. Hence $\\psi$ is injective.\n\n* **Continuity and openness.** The map $\\psi$ is continuous because $\\exp$ and $\\pi$ are continuous. The projection $\\pi$ is open (for any open set $O \\subset G$, $\\pi^{-1}(\\pi(O)) = O H$ is a union of right translates, each open, so $\\pi(O)$ is open). Since $\\exp|_U$ is a homeomorphism onto its image, $\\psi(U) = \\pi(\\exp(U))$ is open in $G/H$. Moreover, the restriction $\\psi : U \\to \\psi(U)$ is a homeomorphism (its inverse is given by $\\psi^{-1}(\\exp(X)H) = X$, which is continuous because locally it can be expressed as the composition of a smooth local section of $\\pi$).\n\nThus $(U, \\psi)$ is a coordinate chart around the point $eH \\in G/H$.\n\n### 5. Extending to an atlas\n\nFor an arbitrary coset $gH \\in G/H$, use left translation. The map\n$$\nL_g : G \\longrightarrow G,\\quad x \\mapsto gx\n$$\nis a diffeomorphism. It descends to a homeomorphism\n$$\n\\tau_g : G/H \\longrightarrow G/H,\\quad \\tau_g(xH) = gxH.\n$$\nDefine the chart around $gH$ by\n$$\n\\psi_g : U \\longrightarrow G/H,\\qquad \\psi_g(X) = \\tau_g(\\psi(X)) = g\\exp(X)H.\n$$\nBecause $\\tau_g$ is a homeomorphism and $\\psi$ is a homeomorphism onto its image, $\\psi_g$ is a homeomorphism from $U$ onto the open neighbourhood $\\tau_g(\\psi(U))$ of $gH$.\n\n### 6. Smoothness of transition maps\n\nTake two such charts $(U, \\psi_g)$ and $(U, \\psi_{g'})$ with non\u2011empty overlap. For $X, Y \\in U$ such that $\\psi_g(X) = \\psi_{g'}(Y)$, we have\n$$\ng\\exp(X)H = g'\\exp(Y)H \\quad\\Longleftrightarrow\\quad (g')^{-1}g\\exp(X) \\in \\exp(Y)H.\n$$\nSet $a = (g')^{-1}g \\in G$. Then there exists a unique $h \\in H$ (close to $e$) satisfying\n$$\na\\exp(X) = \\exp(Y) h.\n$$\nBecause $\\Phi$ is a diffeomorphism on $U \\times V$, we can solve for $Y$ and $h$ smoothly in terms of $X$. More precisely, consider the smooth map\n$$\nF : U \\longrightarrow G,\\quad F(X) = a\\exp(X).\n$$\nFor $X$ sufficiently close to $0$, $F(X)$ lies in the neighbourhood $W$ where $\\Phi^{-1}$ is defined. Then\n$$\n\\Phi^{-1}(F(X)) = (Y(X),\\, h(X)) \\in U \\times V,\n$$\nwith $Y(X)$ and $h(X)$ depending smoothly on $X$. The transition map from the chart $\\psi_g$ to $\\psi_{g'}$ is precisely $X \\mapsto Y(X)$. Since $\\Phi^{-1}$ is smooth, $Y(X)$ is smooth. Consequently, the transition maps are smooth, and the collection $\\{(U, \\psi_g)\\}_{g\\in G}$ forms a smooth atlas on $G/H$.\n\n### 7. Topological properties\n\n* **Second countability.** $G$ is a manifold, hence second countable. The projection $\\pi$ is open and surjective. If $\\mathcal{B}$ is a countable base for $G$, then $\\{\\pi(B) : B \\in \\mathcal{B}\\}$ is a countable base for $G/H$ (any open set in $G/H$ is the image of its preimage, which is a union of sets from $\\mathcal{B}$, and the image of that union equals the union of the images). Thus $G/H$ is second countable.\n\n* **Hausdorff.** Because $H$ is closed, the quotient $G/H$ is Hausdorff. (Standard argument: if $g_1H \\neq g_2H$, then $g_2^{-1}g_1 \\notin H$. Since $H$ is closed, there exists a neighbourhood $U$ of $e$ such that $U g_2^{-1}g_1 \\cap H = \\emptyset$. Then the neighbourhoods $\\pi(g_1U)$ and $\\pi(g_2U)$ separate the two cosets.)\n\nThese properties, together with the smooth atlas, show that $G/H$ is a smooth manifold.\n\n### 8. Dimension\n\nThe charts $(U, \\psi_g)$ map an open subset of $\\mathfrak{m}$ (which is a vector space of dimension $\\dim \\mathfrak{m} = \\dim \\mathfrak{g} - \\dim \\mathfrak{h}$) diffeomorphically onto an open set of $G/H$. Hence the local dimension of $G/H$ is $\\dim \\mathfrak{m} = \\dim G - \\dim H$.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion.** The quotient space $G/H$ is a smooth manifold, and its dimension is $\\dim G - \\dim H$.",

It descends to a homeomorphism\n\\[\n\\tau_g : G/H \\longrightarrow G/H,\\quad \\tau_g(xH) = gxH.\n\\]\nDefine the chart around \\(gH\\) by\n\\[\n\\psi_g : U \\longrightarrow G/H,\\qquad \\psi_g(X) = \\tau_g(\\psi(X)) = g\\exp(X)H.\n\\]\nBecause \\(\\tau_g\\) is a homeomorphism and \\(\\psi\\) is a homeomorphism onto its image, \\(\\psi_g\\) is a homeomorphism from \\(U\\) onto the open neighbourhood \\(\\tau_g(\\psi(U))\\) of \\(gH\\).\n\n### 6. Smoothness of transition maps\n\nTake two such charts \\((U, \\psi_g)\\) and \\((U, \\psi_{g'})\\) with non\u2011empty overlap. For \\(X, Y \\in U\\) such that \\(\\psi_g(X) = \\psi_{g'}(Y)\\), we have\n\\[\ng\\exp(X)H = g'\\exp(Y)H \\quad\\Longleftrightarrow\\quad (g')^{-1}g\\exp(X) \\in \\exp(Y)H.\n\\]\nSet \\(a = (g')^{-1}g \\in G\\). Then there exists a unique \\(h \\in H\\) (close to \\(e\\)) satisfying\n\\[\na\\exp(X) = \\exp(Y) h.\n\\]\nBecause \\(\\Phi\\) is a diffeomorphism on \\(U \\times V\\), we can solve for \\(Y\\) and \\(h\\) smoothly in terms of \\(X\\). More precisely, consider the smooth map\n\\[\nF : U \\longrightarrow G,\\quad F(X) = a\\exp(X).\n\\]\nFor \\(X\\) sufficiently close to \\(0\\), \\(F(X)\\) lies in the neighbourhood \\(W\\) where \\(\\Phi^{-1}\\) is defined. Then\n\\[\n\\Phi^{-1}(F(X)) = (Y(X),\\, h(X)) \\in U \\times V,\n\\]\nwith \\(Y(X)\\) and \\(h(X)\\) depending smoothly on \\(X\\). The transition map from the chart \\(\\psi_g\\) to \\(\\psi_{g'}\\) is precisely \\(X \\mapsto Y(X)\\). Since \\(\\Phi^{-1}\\) is smooth, \\(Y(X)\\) is smooth. Consequently, the transition maps are smooth, and the collection \\(\\{(U, \\psi_g)\\}_{g\\in G}\\) forms a smooth atlas on \\(G/H\\).\n\n### 7. Topological properties\n\n* **Second countability.** \\(G\\) is a manifold, hence second countable. The projection \\(\\pi\\) is open and surjective. If \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) is a countable base for \\(G\\), then \\(\\{\\pi(B) : B \\in \\mathcal{B}\\}\\) is a countable base for \\(G/H\\) (any open set in \\(G/H\\) is the image of its preimage, which is a union of sets from \\(\\mathcal{B}\\), and the image of that union equals the union of the images). Thus \\(G/H\\) is second countable.\n\n* **Hausdorff.** Because \\(H\\) is closed, the quotient \\(G/H\\) is Hausdorff. (Standard argument: if \\(g_1H \\neq g_2H\\), then \\(g_2^{-1}g_1 \\notin H\\). Since \\(H\\) is closed, there exists a neighbourhood \\(U\\) of \\(e\\) such that \\(U g_2^{-1}g_1 \\cap H = \\emptyset\\). Then the neighbourhoods \\(\\pi(g_1U)\\) and \\(\\pi(g_2U)\\) separate the two cosets.)\n\nThese properties, together with the smooth atlas, show that \\(G/H\\) is a smooth manifold.\n\n### 8. Dimension\n\nThe charts \\((U, \\psi_g)\\) map an open subset of \\(\\mathfrak{m}\\) (which is a vector space of dimension \\(\\dim \\mathfrak{m} = \\dim \\mathfrak{g} - \\dim \\mathfrak{h}\\)) diffeomorphically onto an open set of \\(G/H\\). Hence the local dimension of \\(G/H\\) is \\(\\dim \\mathfrak{m} = \\dim G - \\dim H\\).\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion.** The quotient space \\(G/H\\) is a smooth manifold, and its dimension is \\(\\dim G - \\dim H\\).",

We have:\n\n- $\\Gamma(1/2) = \\sqrt{\\pi}$.\n- $\\Gamma(3/2) = \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\Gamma(1/2) = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2}$ (using the functional equation $\\Gamma(z+1)=z\\Gamma(z)$).\n\nHence the left\u2011hand side is $\\sqrt{\\pi} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nOn the right\u2011hand side, $(2\\cdot1-1)!! = 1!! = 1$, so it becomes $\\frac{1 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\pi}}{2^1} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2}$.\n\nThus $\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\neq \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2}$ for any $\\pi \\neq 0,1$, providing a counterexample.\n\nThe correct well\u2011known identities are:\n\n\\[\n\\Gamma\\!\\left(n + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{(2n-1)!! \\sqrt{\\pi}}{2^n}\n\\]\n\nand consequently\n\n\\[\n\\Gamma\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\Gamma\\!\\left(n + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{(2n-1)!! \\,\\pi}{2^n}.\n\\]\n\nEither of these would be a properly posed question. The given statement mistakenly has $\\sqrt{\\pi}$ instead of $\\pi$ in the numerator of the right\u2011hand side.\n\nBecause the requested proof is of a false statement, the question cannot be answered as stated. It would become answerable if the right\u2011hand side were corrected to $\\dfrac{(2n-1)!! \\,\\pi}{2^n}$ (or, equivalently, if the factor $\\Gamma(1/2)$ were omitted from the left\u2011hand side and the right\u2011hand side kept as $\\dfrac{(2n-1)!! \\sqrt{\\pi}}{2^n}$).\n\nThus, I must declare the question ill\u2011posed and refrain from attempting a proof of the incorrect identity.",

Pick any such vertex \\(x\\).\n\n* Since \\(x\\) is not adjacent to \\(1\\), the diagonal \\((1,x)\\) would have weight \\(|1 - L(x)|\\). By our assumption this is \\(\\le k-1\\), so \\(L(x) \\le k\\).\n* Since \\(x\\) is not adjacent to \\(n\\), similarly \\(|n - L(x)| \\le k-1\\), so \\(L(x) \\ge n - k + 1\\).\n\nThus  \n\\[\nn - k + 1 \\le L(x) \\le k \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad n + 1 \\le 2k. \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\nNow we examine the parity of \\(n\\).\n\n* **If \\(n\\) is even**, write \\(n = 2m\\).

The connection 1\u2011form \\(\\omega\\) of the frame is defined by  \n\\[\n\\nabla_v e_1 = \\omega(v)\\, e_2,\\qquad \\nabla_v e_2 = -\\omega(v)\\, e_1.\n\\]  \nA straightforward calculation gives  \n\\[\n\\nabla_v U = \\bigl(d\\varphi(v)+\\omega(v)\\bigr)\\, J U,\n\\]  \nand consequently  \n\\[\n\\alpha = d\\varphi + \\omega. \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\n### 3. Exterior derivative of \\(\\alpha\\)\nFrom (1) we obtain \\(d\\alpha = d\\omega\\) because \\(d(d\\varphi)=0\\). The curvature of the surface is encoded by \\(\\omega\\):  \n\\[\nd\\omega = -K\\, dA, \\tag{2}\n\\]  \nwhere \\(K\\) is the Gaussian curvature and \\(dA\\) is the oriented area form. (This follows from Cartan\u2019s structure equations: with the coframe dual to \\((e_1,e_2)\\) one has \\(d\\omega = -K\\, dA\\).) Hence  \n\\[\nd\\alpha = -K\\, dA \\qquad\\text{on } M\\setminus\\{\\text{zeros}\\}. \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\n### 4. Stokes\u2019 theorem on the manifold with holes\nLet \\(p_1,\\dots,p_k\\) be the zeros of \\(X\\). Choose disjoint closed disks \\(D_i\\) around each \\(p_i\\) as above and set  \n\\[\nM' = M \\setminus \\bigcup_{i=1}^k \\operatorname{int}(D_i).\n\\]  \nThen \\(M'\\) is a compact surface with boundary \\(\\partial M' = \\bigcup_i (-\\partial D_i)\\), where \\(-\\partial D_i\\) means the circle \\(\\partial D_i\\) with the orientation opposite to that induced as the boundary of \\(D_i\\). On \\(M'\\) the forms \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(d\\alpha\\) are smooth.\n\nApply Stokes\u2019 theorem on \\(M'\\):  \n\\[\n\\int_{M'} d\\alpha = \\int_{\\partial M'} \\alpha.\n\\]  \nUsing (3) for the left side and the description of the boundary for the right side,  \n\\[\n-\\int_{M'} K\\, dA = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\int_{-\\partial D_i} \\alpha = -\\sum_{i=1}^k \\int_{\\partial D_i} \\alpha,\n\\]  \nwhere \\(\\partial D_i\\) is oriented as the boundary of \\(D_i\\) (positive orientation with outward normal). Therefore  \n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^k \\int_{\\partial D_i} \\alpha = \\int_{M'} K\\, dA. \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\n### 5. Relating the boundary integrals to indices\nOn each disk \\(D_i\\) we use the representation (1). Integrating over \\(\\partial D_i\\) gives  \n\\[\n\\int_{\\partial D_i} \\alpha = \\int_{\\partial D_i} d\\varphi + \\int_{\\partial D_i} \\omega.\n\\]  \nThe first integral equals \\(2\\pi\\operatorname{ind}_{p_i}(X)\\) by the definition of the index. For the second integral we apply Stokes\u2019 theorem on \\(D_i\\) (the form \\(\\omega\\) is smooth on the whole disk because the frame can be chosen smooth everywhere):  \n\\[\n\\int_{\\partial D_i} \\omega = \\int_{D_i} d\\omega = \\int_{D_i} (-K\\, dA) = -\\int_{D_i} K\\, dA.\n\\]  \nThus  \n\\[\n\\int_{\\partial D_i} \\alpha = 2\\pi\\operatorname{ind}_{p_i}(X) - \\int_{D_i} K\\, dA. \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\n### 6. Summing over all zeros\nSumming (5) over \\(i\\) and inserting into (4) yields  \n\\[\n\\int_{M'} K\\, dA = 2\\pi\\sum_{i=1}^k \\operatorname{ind}_{p_i}(X) - \\sum_{i=1}^k \\int_{D_i} K\\, dA.\n\\]  \nRearranging,  \n\\[\n2\\pi\\sum_{i=1}^k \\operatorname{ind}_{p_i}(X) = \\int_{M'} K\\, dA + \\sum_{i=1}^k \\int_{D_i} K\\, dA = \\int_{M} K\\, dA. \\tag{6}\n\\]\n\n### 7. Gauss\u2013Bonnet and conclusion\nThe Gauss\u2013Bonnet theorem for a compact oriented 2\u2011dimensional Riemannian manifold without boundary states  \n\\[\n\\int_M K\\, dA = 2\\pi\\,\\chi(M),\n\\]  \nwhere \\(\\chi(M)\\) is the Euler characteristic. Substituting into (6) we finally obtain  \n\\[\n\\sum_{\\text{zeros }p} \\operatorname{ind}_p(X) = \\chi(M).\n\\]\n\nThis completes the proof of the Poincar\u00e9\u2013Hopf theorem in the two\u2011dimensional case. \u220e",

Choose a symmetric open neighbourhood $U\\subseteq U_0$ (i.e. $U=U^{-1}$) with $U^2\\subseteq U_0$. Then $U\\cap H=\\{e\\}$ and for any $u,v\\in U$ we have $u^{-1}v\\in U^2\\subseteq U_0$; if additionally $u^{-1}v\\in H$ then $u^{-1}v\\in U_0\\cap H=\\{e\\}$, hence $u=v$.\n\nNow take any $x\\in\\overline{H}$ (the closure of $H$). Suppose, for contradiction, that $x\\notin H$. Since $x\\in\\overline{H}$, there exists a net $(h_\\alpha)$ in $H$ converging to $x$. For sufficiently large indices, all $h_\\alpha$ lie in the open neighbourhood $xU$ of $x$. Because the net converges to $x\\notin H$, it cannot be eventually constant (otherwise that constant would equal $x$, contradicting $x\\notin H$). Thus we can pick two distinct elements $h,k\\in H\\cap xU$. Write $h=xu$, $k=xv$ with $u,v\\in U$. Then\n$$\nh^{-1}k = u^{-1}v \\in U^2\\subseteq U_0.\n$$\nBut $h^{-1}k\\in H$, so $h^{-1}k\\in U_0\\cap H=\\{e\\}$, implying $h=k$, a contradiction. Therefore $x\\in H$ and $H$ is closed.\n\n---\n\n### 2. $G/H$ is a Hausdorff topological group\n\nAs $H$ is a closed normal subgroup of the topological group $G$, the quotient $G/H$ endowed with the quotient topology is a Hausdorff topological group. The quotient map $\\pi:G\\to G/H,\\; g\\mapsto gH$ is open and continuous, and the group operations are well defined because $H$ is normal.\n\n---\n\n### 3. $\\pi$ is a covering map\n\nLet $U$ be the symmetric open neighbourhood constructed in step\u202f1. For any $g\\in G$ consider the open set $gU$. We show that $\\pi|_{gU}$ is a homeomorphism onto its image.\n\n- **Injectivity**: if $\\pi(gu)=\\pi(gv)$ for $u,v\\in U$, then $guH=gvH \\Rightarrow uH=vH \\Rightarrow v^{-1}u\\in H$. But $v^{-1}u\\in U^{-1}U=U^2\\subseteq U_0$, so $v^{-1}u\\in U_0\\cap H=\\{e\\}$; hence $u=v$.\n- $\\pi$ is open (quotient map of a topological group), thus $\\pi|_{gU}$ is an open continuous bijection onto $\\pi(gU)$, hence a homeomorphism.\n\nNow set $W=\\pi(U)$. For any $g\\in G$ we have\n$$\n\\pi^{-1}(\\pi(gU)) = gUH = \\bigcup_{h\\in H} gUh.\n$$\nThe sets $gUh$ are open and pairwise disjoint: if $guh = gvh'$ with $u,v\\in U,\\; h,h'\\in H$, then $uh=vh' \\Rightarrow v^{-1}u = h'h^{-1}\\in H\\cap U^2=\\{e\\}$, so $u=v$ and $h=h'$. Moreover, for each $h\\in H$ the map $R_h:gU\\to gUh,\\; x\\mapsto xh$ is a homeomorphism, and $\\pi|_{gUh} = \\pi|_{gU}\\circ R_{h^{-1}}$, hence $\\pi|_{gUh}$ is also a homeomorphism onto $\\pi(gU)$. Therefore every point of $G/H$ has an evenly covered neighbourhood (e.g. $\\pi(gU)$), so $\\pi$ is a covering map. The deck transformations are precisely the right multiplications by elements of $H$, which are diffeomorphisms of $G$.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Smooth structure on $G/H$\n\nBecause $\\pi$ is a covering map and the deck transformations $R_h\\;(h\\in H)$ are diffeomorphisms, we can equip $G/H$ with a unique smooth structure such that $\\pi$ becomes a local diffeomorphism. One explicit construction is as follows.\n\nChoose an atlas $\\{(V_i,\\varphi_i)\\}$ of $G$ with each $V_i$ contained in some translate $gU$ (so that $\\pi|_{V_i}$ is a diffeomorphism onto its image). Then define charts on $G/H$ by\n$$\n\\bigl(\\pi(V_i),\\;\\varphi_i\\circ(\\pi|_{V_i})^{-1}\\bigr).\n$$\nIf two such charts overlap, say on $\\pi(V_i)\\cap\\pi(V_j)\\neq\\varnothing$, then on the overlap\n$$\n(\\pi|_{V_j})^{-1}\\circ\\pi|_{V_i} = R_h\n$$\nfor some $h\\in H$ (the deck transformation sending the sheet containing $V_i$ to the sheet containing $V_j$). Since $R_h$ is a diffeomorphism, the transition map\n$$\n\\varphi_j\\circ(\\pi|_{V_j})^{-1}\\circ\\pi|_{V_i}\\circ\\varphi_i^{-1} = \\varphi_j\\circ R_h\\circ\\varphi_i^{-1}\n$$\nis smooth. Hence we obtain a smooth atlas on $G/H$. With this structure $\\pi$ is a local diffeomorphism by construction. Moreover, $G/H$ is second countable (as the open continuous image of a second countable space) and Hausdorff, so it is a smooth manifold.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Smoothness of the group operations\n\nThe group operations on $G/H$ are\n$$\n\\mu'([x],[y]) = [xy],\\qquad \\iota'([x]) = [x^{-1}].\n$$\nBecause $\\pi$ is a homomorphism, we have\n$$\n\\mu'\\circ(\\pi\\times\\pi) = \\pi\\circ\\mu,\\qquad \\iota'\\circ\\pi = \\pi\\circ\\iota,\n$$\nwhere $\\mu,\\iota$ are the multiplication and inversion on $G$.\n\nLet us prove that $\\mu'$ is smooth. Fix $(p,q)\\in G/H\\times G/H$ and choose $(x,y)\\in G\\times G$ with $\\pi(x)=p,\\;\\pi(y)=q$. Since $\\pi$ is a local diffeomorphism, there exist open neighbourhoods $A$ of $x$ and $B$ of $y$ such that $\\pi|_A:A\\to\\pi(A)$ and $\\pi|_B:B\\to\\pi(B)$ are diffeomorphisms. Then\n$$\n\\pi(A)\\times\\pi(B)\n$$\nis an open neighbourhood of $(p,q)$, and $\\pi|_A\\times\\pi|_B : A\\times B \\to \\pi(A)\\times\\pi(B)$ is a diffeomorphism. On this neighbourhood we can write\n$$\n\\mu' = \\pi\\circ\\mu\\circ\\bigl((\\pi|_A\\times\\pi|_B)^{-1}\\bigr).\n$$\nThe right\u2011hand side is a composition of smooth maps ($\\mu$ smooth on $G$, $\\pi$ smooth, and the inverse of a diffeomorphism is smooth), hence $\\mu'$ is smooth near $(p,q)$. As $(p,q)$ was arbitrary, $\\mu'$ is smooth everywhere.\n\nThe same argument applied to a single neighbourhood shows that $\\iota'$ is smooth:\n$$\n\\iota' = \\pi\\circ\\iota\\circ(\\pi|_A)^{-1}\n$$\non $\\pi(A)$, which is smooth.\n\nTherefore $G/H$ is a Lie group.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Dimension\n\nBecause $\\pi$ is a local diffeomorphism, its differential at any point is an isomorphism of tangent spaces. Consequently\n$$\n\\dim(G/H) = \\dim G.\n$$\n(Equivalently, since $H$ is discrete, $\\dim H = 0$ and the usual dimension formula for quotients by closed Lie subgroups gives $\\dim(G/H)=\\dim G-\\dim H = \\dim G$.)\n\n---\n\nThus $G/H$ is a Lie group and its dimension equals that of $G$. \u220e",

Let  \n\n\\[\nm = \\min_{x \\in [0,1]} f(x), \\qquad M = \\max_{x \\in [0,1]} f(x).\n\\]\n\nThen for every $x \\in [0,1]$ we have  \n\n\\[\nm \\le f(x) \\le M.\n\\]\n\nIntegrating this inequality over $[0,1]$ yields  \n\n\\[\n\\int_0^1 m \\,dx \\;\\le\\; \\int_0^1 f(x)\\,dx \\;\\le\\; \\int_0^1 M \\,dx.\n\\]\n\nBecause $\\int_0^1 m \\,dx = m$ and $\\int_0^1 M \\,dx = M$ (the length of the interval is $1$), we obtain  \n\n\\[\nm \\;\\le\\; \\int_0^1 f(x)\\,dx \\;\\le\\; M.\n\\]\n\nThe hypothesis states that $\\int_0^1 f(x)\\,dx = 0$, so  \n\n\\[\nm \\le 0 \\le M. \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\nNow we consider three possibilities.\n\n* **Case 1:** $m = 0$. Then the minimum value of $f$ is $0$, so there exists $c \\in [0,1]$ with $f(c) = m = 0$.\n* **Case 2:** $M = 0$. Then the maximum value of $f$ is $0$, so there exists $c \\in [0,1]$ with $f(c) = M = 0$.\n* **Case 3:** $m < 0 < M$. Then there exist points $a, b \\in [0,1]$ such that $f(a) = m < 0$ and $f(b) = M > 0$. Since $f$ is continuous on $[0,1]$, the Intermediate Value Theorem applied to the interval between $a$ and $b$ guarantees a point $c$ between $a$ and $b$ (hence $c \\in [0,1]$) with $f(c) = 0$.\n\nIn every case we have found a point $c \\in [0,1]$ satisfying $f(c) = 0$. This completes the proof. \u220e",

The argument proceeds by verifying that $\\sqrt{I}$ is an additive subgroup of $R$ and that it absorbs multiplication by elements of $R$.\n\n---\n\n**Proof.**\n\nWe show that $\\sqrt{I}$ satisfies the definition of an ideal: it contains $0$, is closed under addition and additive inverses (hence an additive subgroup), and for any $r \\in R$ and $x \\in \\sqrt{I}$ we have $r x \\in \\sqrt{I}$.\n\n1. **Zero is in $\\sqrt{I}$.**  \n   Since $0^1 = 0 \\in I$, we have $0 \\in \\sqrt{I}$.\n\n2. **Additive inverses.**  \n   Let $x \\in \\sqrt{I}$. Then there exists a positive integer $m$ such that $x^m \\in I$. Because $(-x)^m = (-1)^m x^m$ and $I$ is an ideal, $(-1)^m x^m \\in I$. Hence $-x \\in \\sqrt{I}$.\n\n3. **Closure under addition.**  \n   Take $x, y \\in \\sqrt{I}$. Choose positive integers $a, b$ with $x^a \\in I$ and $y^b \\in I$. Set $n = a + b$. By the binomial theorem (which holds in any commutative ring),\n   $$\n   (x + y)^n = \\sum_{i=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{i} \\, x^i y^{n-i}.\n   $$\n   We claim each term $\\binom{n}{i} x^i y^{n-i}$ lies in $I$.  \n   *Case 1:* $i \\ge a$. Then we can write $x^i = x^a \\cdot x^{i-a}$. Since $x^a \\in I$ and $I$ is an ideal,\n   $$\n   x^i y^{n-i} = (x^a \\cdot x^{i-a}) y^{n-i} = x^a \\cdot (x^{i-a} y^{n-i}) \\in I.\n   $$\n   *Case 2:* $i < a$. Then $n - i = a + b - i > a + b - (a-1) = b+1$, so $n-i \\ge b+1 > b$. Hence we can write $y^{n-i} = y^b \\cdot y^{n-i-b}$. Because $y^b \\in I$,\n   $$\n   x^i y^{n-i} = x^i (y^b \\cdot y^{n-i-b}) = (x^i y^{n-i-b}) \\cdot y^b \\in I.\n   $$\n   Thus in both cases the monomial $x^i y^{n-i}$ belongs to $I$. The integer $\\binom{n}{i}$ indicates that we add this monomial $\\binom{n}{i}$ times; since $I$ is an additive subgroup, repeated addition of an element of $I$ remains in $I$. Therefore each term $\\binom{n}{i} x^i y^{n-i}$ is in $I$.  \n   The sum of finitely many elements of $I$ is again in $I$, so $(x+y)^n \\in I$. Consequently $x+y \\in \\sqrt{I}$.\n\n   Together with step\u202f2, this shows that $\\sqrt{I}$ is an additive subgroup of $R$.\n\n4. **Absorption under multiplication by ring elements.**  \n   Let $x \\in \\sqrt{I}$ with $x^m \\in I$ and let $r \\in R$.

By the binomial theorem (which holds in any commutative ring),\n   \\[\n   (x + y)^n = \\sum_{i=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{i} \\, x^i y^{n-i}.\n   \\]\n   We claim each term \\(\\binom{n}{i} x^i y^{n-i}\\) lies in \\(I\\).  \n   *Case 1:* \\(i \\ge a\\). Then we can write \\(x^i = x^a \\cdot x^{i-a}\\). Since \\(x^a \\in I\\) and \\(I\\) is an ideal,\n   \\[\n   x^i y^{n-i} = (x^a \\cdot x^{i-a}) y^{n-i} = x^a \\cdot (x^{i-a} y^{n-i}) \\in I.\n   \\]\n   *Case 2:* \\(i < a\\). Then \\(n - i = a + b - i > a + b - (a-1) = b+1\\), so \\(n-i \\ge b+1 > b\\). Hence we can write \\(y^{n-i} = y^b \\cdot y^{n-i-b}\\). Because \\(y^b \\in I\\),\n   \\[\n   x^i y^{n-i} = x^i (y^b \\cdot y^{n-i-b}) = (x^i y^{n-i-b}) \\cdot y^b \\in I.\n   \\]\n   Thus in both cases the monomial \\(x^i y^{n-i}\\) belongs to \\(I\\). The integer \\(\\binom{n}{i}\\) indicates that we add this monomial \\(\\binom{n}{i}\\) times; since \\(I\\) is an additive subgroup, repeated addition of an element of \\(I\\) remains in \\(I\\). Therefore each term \\(\\binom{n}{i} x^i y^{n-i}\\) is in \\(I\\).  \n   The sum of finitely many elements of \\(I\\) is again in \\(I\\), so \\((x+y)^n \\in I\\). Consequently \\(x+y \\in \\sqrt{I}\\).\n\n   Together with step\u202f2, this shows that \\(\\sqrt{I}\\) is an additive subgroup of \\(R\\).\n\n4. **Absorption under multiplication by ring elements.**  \n   Let \\(x \\in \\sqrt{I}\\) with \\(x^m \\in I\\) and let \\(r \\in R\\). Then\n   \\[\n   (r x)^m = r^m x^m.\n   \\]\n   Because \\(x^m \\in I\\) and \\(I\\) is an ideal, \\(r^m x^m \\in I\\). Hence \\(r x \\in \\sqrt{I}\\).\n\nSince \\(\\sqrt{I}\\) is an additive subgroup of \\(R\\) and is closed under multiplication by arbitrary elements of \\(R\\), it is an ideal of \\(R\\). \u220e\n\n---\n\n**Remark.** The proof does not use the hypothesis that \\(I\\) is finitely generated; the radical of any ideal in a commutative ring with unity is an ideal. The finite generation is therefore superfluous for this statement.",
