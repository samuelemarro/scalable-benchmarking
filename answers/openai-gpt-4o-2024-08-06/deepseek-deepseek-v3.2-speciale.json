The only explicit rule of inference is Modus Ponens, but the standard logical rules are implicitly available.\n\n**Goal:** Prove or disprove $a \\neq b$.\n\n### Proof\n\n1. From Axiom 1, by universal instantiation (taking $x = a$), we obtain  \n   $$\n   P(a) \\rightarrow Q(a). \\tag{1}\n   $$\n\n2. Axiom 2 states $P(a)$. \\tag{2}\n\n3. Applying Modus Ponens to (1) and (2) yields  \n   $$\n   Q(a). \\tag{3}\n   $$\n\n4. Now assume, for the sake of contradiction, that $a = b$.\n\n5. By the substitution property of equality, from $a = b$ and $Q(a)$ we infer $Q(b)$. \\tag{4}\n\n6. Axiom 3 asserts $\\neg Q(b)$. \\tag{5}\n\n7. Statements (4) and (5) contradict each other ($Q(b) \\land \\neg Q(b)$).\n\n8. Therefore, the assumption $a = b$ must be false. Hence, $a \\neq b$.\n\nThus, $a \\neq b$ is a logical consequence of the given axioms; it can be formally derived using standard logical rules together with Modus Ponens.\n\n**Final answer:** $a \\neq b$ is provable.",

        "answer": "We prove the theorem using Gaussian integers.\n\n---\n\n### Theorem\nIf $p$ is a prime and $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, then there exist integers $x, y$ such that $p = x^2 + y^2$.\n\n### Proof\n\n1. **Existence of a square root of $-1$ modulo $p$**  \n   Since $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, $(p-1)/2$ is even. By Euler's criterion,\n   $$\n   (-1)^{\\frac{p-1}{2}} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p},\n   $$\n   so $-1$ is a quadratic residue modulo $p$. Equivalently, there exists an integer $a$ with\n   $$\n   a^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}.\n   $$\n   (One can also argue using the cyclicity of $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$: its order $p-1$ is divisible by $4$, so an element of order $4$ satisfies $g^2 = -1$; then $a = g^{(p-1)/4}$ works.)\n\n2. **$p$ divides a product in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$**  \n   The above congruence implies $p \\mid a^2 + 1$. In the ring of Gaussian integers $\\mathbb{Z}[i] = \\{x+iy \\mid x,y\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\}$,\n   $$\n   a^2 + 1 = (a+i)(a-i),\n   $$\n   hence $p \\mid (a+i)(a-i)$.\n\n3. **$p$ does not divide either factor**  \n   Suppose $p \\mid a+i$. Then there exist integers $c,d$ such that\n   $$\n   a+i = p(c+di).\n   $$\n   Comparing imaginary parts gives $1 = p\\,d$, impossible because $p \\nmid 1$. Similarly, $p \\nmid a-i$. Therefore $p$ divides the product but neither factor.\n\n4. **$\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a unique factorization domain**  \n   The norm $N(x+iy) = x^2 + y^2$ makes $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ a Euclidean domain, hence a UFD. In a UFD, every irreducible element is prime: if an irreducible divides a product, it must divide at least one factor.\n\n5. **$p$ is not irreducible in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$**  \n   If $p$ were irreducible (hence prime) in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$, then from $p \\mid (a+i)(a-i)$ we would have $p \\mid a+i$ or $p \\mid a-i$, contradicting step 3. Thus $p$ is reducible: there exist non\u2011unit elements $\\alpha, \\beta \\in \\mathbb{Z}[i]$ such that\n   $$\n   p = \\alpha \\beta.\n   $$\n\n6. **Norms give the representation**  \n   Take norms:\n   $$\n   N(p) = p^2 = N(\\alpha) N(\\beta).\n   $$\n   Since $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are non\u2011units, $N(\\alpha) > 1$ and $N(\\beta) > 1$ (the only elements of norm $1$ are the units $\\pm 1, \\pm i$). The only positive factorisation of $p^2$ with both factors $>1$ is $p \\cdot p$. Hence\n   $$\n   N(\\alpha) = N(\\beta) = p.\n   $$\n   Write $\\alpha = x + i y$ with $x,y \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Then\n   $$\n   p = N(\\alpha) = x^2 + y^2,\n   $$\n   which is the desired sum of two squares.\n\n---\n\n### Example: $p = 13$\n\n- $13 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, so the theorem applies.\n- Find an integer $a$ with $a^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{13}$. Trying small values:\n  $$\n  5^2 = 25 \\equiv 12 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{13},\n  $$\n  so $a = 5$ works.\n- In $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$, we have $13 \\mid (5+i)(5-i)$. Compute a common divisor of $13$ and $5+i$ using the Euclidean algorithm (or by inspection):\n  $$\n  (5+i) = (2+3i)(1-i), \\qquad 13 = (2+3i)(2-3i).\n  $$\n  Hence $2+3i$ divides both, and its norm is\n  $$\n  N(2+3i) = 2^2 + 3^2 = 13.\n  $$\n  Therefore\n  $$\n  13 = 2^2 + 3^2.\n  $$\n\nThus we can take $(x,y) = (2,3)$ (or any permutation/change of signs).\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:** The theorem is proved as above, and for $p=13$ we have $13 = 2^2 + 3^2$.",
