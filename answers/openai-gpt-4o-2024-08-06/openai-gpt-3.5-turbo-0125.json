To show this, we need to demonstrate that $u$ satisfies the Laplace equation $\\Delta u = 0$ in $D$, where $\\Delta$ is the Laplacian operator.\n\nFirst, let's express $u$ in terms of $x$ and $y$ where $z = x + iy$:\n\n$$u(z) = \\log \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - |z|^2} \\right) = \\log \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - (x^2 + y^2)} \\right) = \\log \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - x^2 - y^2} \\right).$$\n\nNow, we compute the Laplacian of $u$:\n\n$$\\Delta u = \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2}.$$\n\nCalculating the partial derivatives:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\frac{-2x}{1 - x^2 - y^2},$$\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = \\frac{-2y}{1 - x^2 - y^2}.$$\n\nNow, we compute the second partial derivatives:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{2(1 - x^2 - y^2) - 4x^2}{(1 - x^2 - y^2)^2},$$\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} = \\frac{2(1 - x^2 - y^2) - 4y^2}{(1 - x^2 - y^2)^2}.$$\n\nAdding these together:\n\n$$\\Delta u = \\frac{4 - 2x^2 - 2y^2 - 4x^2 - 4y^2}{(1 - x^2 - y^2)^2} = 0.$$\n\nTherefore, $u$ is harmonic on the open unit disk $D$.\n\nNext, we investigate whether $u$ can be extended to a harmonic function on the closed unit disk $\\overline{D} = \\{ z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z| \\leq 1 \\}$. Since $u$ is harmonic on $D$, it can be extended to $\\overline{D}$ if $u$ is continuous on $\\partial D$, the boundary of $D$.\n\nThe function $u(z) = \\log \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - |z|^2} \\right)$ is not continuous on $\\partial D$ because as $z$ approaches the boundary $|z| = 1$, the denominator $1 - |z|^2$ approaches zero, causing the logarithm to be undefined. Therefore, $u$ cannot be extended to a harmonic function on the closed unit disk $\\overline{D}$.\n\nIn conclusion, $u$ is a harmonic function on the open unit disk $D$, but it cannot be extended to a harmonic function on the closed unit disk $\\overline{D}$.",
