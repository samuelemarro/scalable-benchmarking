Additionally, $n_7$ must divide 56 and be of the form $7k + 1$ for some integer $k$.\n\nSince $56 = 2^3 \\times 7$, the possible values for $n_7$ are 1, 8, or 64. However, $n_7$ cannot be 64 as it would imply that there are 64 Sylow 7-subgroups, which is not possible given the order of the group. Therefore, $n_7$ must be either 1 or 8.\n\nIf $n_7 = 1$, then there is a unique Sylow 7-subgroup, which we denote as $H$. In this case, $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ since any subgroup of index 2 is normal. Thus, $H$ is a normal subgroup of order 7.\n\nIf $n_7 = 8$, then there are 8 distinct Sylow 7-subgroups.

To show this, we need to demonstrate that $u$ satisfies the Laplace equation $\\Delta u = 0$ in $D$, where $\\Delta$ is the Laplacian operator.\n\nFirst, let's express $u$ in terms of $x$ and $y$ where $z = x + iy$:\n\n$$u(z) = \\log \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - |z|^2} \\right) = \\log \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - (x^2 + y^2)} \\right) = \\log \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - x^2 - y^2} \\right).$$\n\nNow, we compute the Laplacian of $u$:\n\n$$\\Delta u = \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2}.$$\n\nCalculating the partial derivatives:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\frac{1}{1 - x^2 - y^2} \\cdot (-2x) = \\frac{-2x}{1 - x^2 - y^2},$$\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = \\frac{1}{1 - x^2 - y^2} \\cdot (-2y) = \\frac{-2y}{1 - x^2 - y^2}.$$\n\nNow, we compute the second partial derivatives:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{-2(1 - x^2 - y^2) - (-2x)(-2x)}{(1 - x^2 - y^2)^2} = \\frac{2(1 - x^2 - y^2) - 4x^2}{(1 - x^2 - y^2)^2},$$\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} = \\frac{2(1 - x^2 - y^2) - 4y^2}{(1 - x^2 - y^2)^2}.$$\n\nAdding these together:\n\n$$\\Delta u = \\frac{2(1 - x^2 - y^2) - 4x^2 + 2(1 - x^2 - y^2) - 4y^2}{(1 - x^2 - y^2)^2} = \\frac{4 - 2x^2 - 2y^2 - 4x^2 - 4y^2}{(1 - x^2 - y^2)^2} = 0.$$\n\nTherefore, $u$ is harmonic on the open unit disk $D$.\n\nNext, we investigate whether $u$ can be extended to a harmonic function on the closed unit disk $\\overline{D} = \\{ z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z| \\leq 1 \\}$.

Comparison and Discussion:**\n\nTo compare the two approximations, we need to consider the error terms associated with each method. In general, Simpson's Rule provides a more accurate approximation than the Trapezoidal Rule for smooth functions like $e^{-x^2}$ due to its higher order of accuracy.\n\nSimpson's Rule has an error term proportional to $(b-a)^5/n^4$, while the Trapezoidal Rule has an error term proportional to $(b-a)^3/n^2$. Since both methods use $n = 4$ subintervals in this case, Simpson's Rule is expected to have a smaller error and therefore a more accurate approximation compared to the Trapezoidal Rule.\n\nTherefore, based on the error analysis, Simpson's Rule is likely to provide a more accurate approximation of the integral $\\int_{0}^{1} e^{-x^2} \\, dx$ compared to the Trapezoidal Rule when using $n = 4$ subintervals.",

        "answer": "**Answer:**\n\nGiven a finite group $G$ of order 28, we aim to prove that $G$ has a normal subgroup of order 7.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 7-subgroups, denoted $n_7$, divides the order of $G$ (28) and is congruent to 1 modulo 7. This means $n_7$ could be 1 or 4.\n\nLet's consider the two cases:\n\n**Case 1: $n_7 = 1$**\nIf $n_7 = 1$, then there exists a unique Sylow 7-subgroup, say $H$, of order 7. By the Sylow theorems, any two Sylow 7-subgroups are conjugate to each other. Since there is only one Sylow 7-subgroup, it must be normal in $G$. Therefore, $H$ is a normal subgroup of order 7 in $G$.\n\n**Case 2: $n_7 = 4$**\nIf $n_7 = 4$, then there are 4 Sylow 7-subgroups, each of order 7. Let $H_1, H_2, H_3, H_4$ be these Sylow 7-subgroups. Since the number of Sylow 7-subgroups is congruent to 1 modulo 7, there must be a unique Sylow 7-subgroup for each of these 4 subgroups.
