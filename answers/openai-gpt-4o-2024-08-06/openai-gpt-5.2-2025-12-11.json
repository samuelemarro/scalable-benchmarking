In particular,\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{-1}{p}\\right) = (-1)^{\\frac{p-1}{2}}.\n$$\nSince $p\\equiv 1\\pmod 4$, we have $\\frac{p-1}{2}$ even, hence\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{-1}{p}\\right)=1.\n$$\nTherefore $-1$ is a quadratic residue mod $p$, i.e. there exists an integer $a$ such that\n$$\na^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod p.\n$$\n\n## 2) A pigeonhole argument to get a small solution of $x^2+y^2\\equiv 0\\pmod p$\n\nLet $n=\\lfloor \\sqrt p\\rfloor$.
