        "answer": "To determine whether $a \\neq b$ can be proven or disproven given the axioms and rules of inference, let's analyze the logical system step by step.\n\n### Axioms and Rules\n\n1. **Axiom 1**: $\\forall x \\in D, P(x) \\rightarrow Q(x)$\n\n   This states that for every element $x$ in the domain $D$, if $P(x)$ is true, then $Q(x)$ must also be true.\n\n2. **Axiom 2**: $P(a)$\n\n   This states that the predicate $P$ is true for the specific element $a$.\n\n3. **Axiom 3**: $\\neg Q(b)$\n\n   This states that the predicate $Q$ is false for the specific element $b$.\n\n4. **Rule of Inference**: Modus Ponens\n\n   From $A \\rightarrow B$ and $A$, infer $B$.\n\n### Proof\n\nLet's apply the axioms and the rule of inference to see if we can derive $a \\neq b$.\n\n- From **Axiom 2** ($P(a)$) and **Axiom 1** ($\\forall x \\in D, P(x) \\rightarrow Q(x)$), we can apply the rule of inference (Modus Ponens) to conclude $Q(a)$. Specifically, since $P(a)$ is true, and $P(a) \\rightarrow Q(a)$ is a specific instance of Axiom 1, we have:\n\n  $$\n  Q(a)\n  $$\n\n- From **Axiom 3** ($\\neg Q(b)$), we know that $Q(b)$ is false.\n\nNow, we have:\n\n- $Q(a)$ is true.\n- $Q(b)$ is false.\n\nIf $a = b$, then $Q(a)$ and $Q(b)$ would refer to the same element, implying $Q(a) = Q(b)$. However, we have $Q(a)$ is true and $Q(b)$ is false, which is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, $a \\neq b$ must be true to avoid this contradiction.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the axioms and the rule of inference, we have shown that $a \\neq b$ must hold to maintain logical consistency. Thus, the statement $a \\neq b$ is proven.\n\n$$\n\\boxed{a \\neq b}\n$$",

        "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to prove that for a prime number $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, there exist integers $x$ and $y$ such that $p = x^2 + y^2$. We will then find such integers for $p = 13$.\n\n### Step 1: Prove the Existence of $x$ and $y$\n\n**Fermat's Theorem on Sums of Two Squares** states that a prime number $p$ can be expressed as a sum of two squares if and only if $p = 2$ or $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$. Since $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$ by the problem's condition, it follows from Fermat's theorem that there exist integers $x$ and $y$ such that $p = x^2 + y^2$.\n\n**Proof Sketch:**\n\n1. **Quadratic Residues:** For a prime $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, $-1$ is a quadratic residue modulo $p$. This means there exists an integer $a$ such that $a^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$.\n\n2. **Gaussian Integers:** Consider the ring of Gaussian integers $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$, where $i^2 = -1$. The norm of a Gaussian integer $z = a + bi$ is $N(z) = a^2 + b^2$.\n\n3. **Factorization in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$:** Since $a^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$, we have $a^2 + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$, implying $p \\mid (a^2 + 1)$. Thus, $p \\mid (a + bi)(a - bi)$ in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$.\n\n4. **Prime Factorization:** In $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$, $p$ can be factored as $p = \\pi \\overline{\\pi}$ where $\\pi = a + bi$ and $\\overline{\\pi} = a - bi$. The norm $N(\\pi) = a^2 + b^2$ is $p$.\n\n5. **Conclusion:** Therefore, $p = a^2 + b^2$.\n\n### Step 2: Find $x$ and $y$ for $p = 13$\n\nNow, we need to find integers $x$ and $y$ such that $13 = x^2 + y^2$.\n\n1. **Check Small Values:**\n   - $x = 0$: $y^2 = 13$ (not a perfect square)\n   - $x = 1$: $y^2 = 13 - 1^2 = 12$ (not a perfect square)\n   - $x = 2$: $y^2 = 13 - 2^2 = 9$ (perfect square, $y = 3$)\n   - $x = 3$: $y^2 = 13 - 3^2 = 4$ (perfect square, $y = 2$)\n\n2. **Solutions:**\n   - $x = 2, y = 3$ gives $13 = 2^2 + 3^2$.\n   - $x = 3, y = 2$ gives $13 = 3^2 + 2^2$.\n\nThus, the integers $x$ and $y$ such that $13 = x^2 + y^2$ are $(x, y) = (2, 3)$ or $(x, y) = (3, 2)$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nFor $p = 13$, the integers $x$ and $y$ such that $13 = x^2 + y^2$ are $(x, y) = (2, 3)$ or $(x, y) = (3, 2)$.",
