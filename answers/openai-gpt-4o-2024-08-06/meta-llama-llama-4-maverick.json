        "answer": "## Step 1: Understand the given axioms and the rule of inference.\nWe are given three axioms and one rule of inference. Axiom 1 states that for all $x$ in the domain $D$, if $P(x)$ is true, then $Q(x)$ is true. Axiom 2 states that $P(a)$ is true. Axiom 3 states that $Q(b)$ is false. The rule of inference is Modus Ponens, which allows us to infer $B$ if we have $A \\rightarrow B$ and $A$.\n\n## Step 2: Apply Axiom 1 and Axiom 2 using Modus Ponens to derive $Q(a)$.\nFrom Axiom 1, we have $\\forall x \\in D, P(x) \\rightarrow Q(x)$. This implies $P(a) \\rightarrow Q(a)$ because $a \\in D$. Given $P(a)$ from Axiom 2, we can use Modus Ponens to infer $Q(a)$.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the derived statement $Q(a)$ and Axiom 3.\nWe have derived that $Q(a)$ is true. Axiom 3 states that $\\neg Q(b)$, meaning $Q(b)$ is false. This gives us a contradiction if $a = b$ because it would imply both $Q(a)$ and $\\neg Q(a)$ if $a$ and $b$ were the same element.\n\n## Step 4: Determine if $a = b$ is possible given the derived statements.\nIf $a = b$, then $Q(a) = Q(b)$. However, we have $Q(a)$ being true and $Q(b)$ being false. This is a contradiction, so $a$ cannot be equal to $b$.\n\n## Step 5: Conclude based on the analysis.\nSince assuming $a = b$ leads to a contradiction ($Q(a)$ is both true and false), we must conclude that $a \\neq b$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{a \\neq b}$",

        "answer": "## Step 1: Understand the problem statement\nThe problem asks us to prove that for a prime number $p$ where $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, there exist integers $x$ and $y$ such that $p = x^2 + y^2$. Additionally, we need to find specific $x$ and $y$ for $p = 13$.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the relevant theorem\nThe statement that every prime $p$ with $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$ can be expressed as $p = x^2 + y^2$ for some integers $x$ and $y$ is known as Fermat's theorem on the sum of two squares.\n\n## Step 3: Prove Fermat's theorem on the sum of two squares for $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$\nTo prove this, we can use the fact that $-1$ is a quadratic residue modulo $p$ if $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$. This implies there exists an integer $a$ such that $a^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$. We can then use this to show that $p$ can be represented as a sum of two squares.\n\n## Step 4: Show that $-1$ is a quadratic residue modulo $p$\nFor $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, by Euler's criterion, $-1$ is a quadratic residue modulo $p$ because $(-1)^{(p-1)/2} = (-1)^{(p-1)/2} = 1$ since $(p-1)/2$ is even.\n\n## Step 5: Use the fact that $-1$ is a quadratic residue to find $a$ such that $a^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$\nThere exists an $a$ such that $a^2 + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$, meaning $a^2 + 1 = kp$ for some integer $k$.\n\n## Step 6: Apply the Brahmagupta\u2013Fibonacci identity or use a descent argument to show $p$ is a sum of two squares\nHowever, a more straightforward approach to prove $p = x^2 + y^2$ involves using the properties of Gaussian integers or a descent argument. For $p = 13$, we can directly check values or use the fact that since $-1$ is a quadratic residue mod $13$, we can find $a$ such that $a^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{13}$.\n\n## Step 7: Find $a$ such that $a^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{13}$\nWe need to find an integer $a$ such that $a^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{13}$. Checking squares modulo $13$, we find $5^2 = 25 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{13}$ because $25 = 1 + 2*12$.\n\n## Step 8: Use $a = 5$ to express $13$ as a sum of two squares\nSince $5^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{13}$, we have $5^2 + 1 = 26 = 2*13$. This implies that $13$ can be represented as a sum of two squares using a different method. We directly check: $2^2 + 3^2 = 4 + 9 = 13$.\n\n## Step 9: Verify the representation for $p = 13$\nFor $p = 13$, $x = 2$ and $y = 3$ satisfy $p = x^2 + y^2$ because $13 = 2^2 + 3^2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2, 3}$",
