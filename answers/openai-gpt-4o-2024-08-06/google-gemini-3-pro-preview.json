By applying the transitivity property ($\\psi_{\\text{trans}}$) repeatedly along this chain, we deduce that $R^{\\mathcal{N}}(a_j, a_i)$.\n7.

For any valid subset $A$, there are two mutually exclusive cases regarding $n$:\n\n**Case 1: $n \\notin A$**\nIf $n$ is not included in $A$, then $A$ must be a valid subset of $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, n-1\\}$. By definition, there are $a_{n-1}$ such subsets.\n\n**Case 2: $n \\in A$**\nIf $n$ is included in $A$, then $n-1$ cannot be in $A$ because consecutive integers are not allowed. Therefore, the remaining elements of $A$ must be a valid subset of $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, n-2\\}$. By definition, there are $a_{n-2}$ such subsets.\n\nThus, the total number of valid subsets satisfies the linear recurrence relation:\n$$ a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} $$\n\n### 2.

The only subset is $\\emptyset$, which has no consecutive integers.\n    $$ a_0 = 1 $$\n*   **For $n=1$**: The set is $\\{1\\}$. The subsets are $\\emptyset$ and $\\{1\\}$.

To determine the degree of the extension $[K : \\mathbb{Q}]$ and find a basis, we will construct the field extension in steps and apply the Tower Law.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the intermediate field $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$\n\nConsider the intermediate field $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The element $\\sqrt{2}$ is a root of the polynomial $p(x) = x^2 - 2$.\n\n1.  **Irreducibility**: The polynomial $x^2 - 2$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's Criterion (with prime $p=2$) or simply because $\\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.\n2.  **Degree**: Since $p(x)$ is the minimal polynomial of $\\sqrt{2}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, the degree of the extension is:\n    $$[L : \\mathbb{Q}] = [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) : \\mathbb{Q}] = \\deg(x^2 - 2) = 2$$\n3.  **Basis**: A basis for $L$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is given by $\\{1, \\sqrt{2}\\}$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the full extension $K = L(\\sqrt{3})$\n\nNow consider $K$ as an extension of $L$, i.e., $K = L(\\sqrt{3}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})(\\sqrt{3})$. The element $\\sqrt{3}$ is a root of the polynomial $q(x) = x^2 - 3$.\n\nTo determine the degree $[K : L]$, we must check if the polynomial $x^2 - 3$ is irreducible over $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Since the polynomial is quadratic, it is reducible over $L$ if and only if it has a root in $L$. That is, we must determine if $\\sqrt{3} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\n**Proposition**: $\\sqrt{3} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\n**Proof**:\nAssume, for the sake of contradiction, that $\\sqrt{3} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Then there exist rational numbers $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ such that:\n$$ \\sqrt{3} = a + b\\sqrt{2} $$\nSquare both sides of the equation:\n$$ 3 = (a + b\\sqrt{2})^2 $$\n$$ 3 = a^2 + 2b^2 + 2ab\\sqrt{2} $$\nRearranging the terms:\n$$ 3 - a^2 - 2b^2 = 2ab\\sqrt{2} $$\nSince $\\sqrt{2}$ is irrational and $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, this equation holds only if the coefficient of $\\sqrt{2}$ is zero. Thus, $2ab = 0$, which implies $a = 0$ or $b = 0$.\n\n*   **Case 1**: $b = 0$.\n    The equation becomes $3 = a^2$. This implies $\\sqrt{3} = |a|$. Since $a \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, this would mean $\\sqrt{3}$ is rational, which is false.\n*   **Case 2**: $a = 0$.\n    The equation becomes $3 = 2b^2$, which implies $b^2 = \\frac{3}{2}$.

        "raw_answer": "Let $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. To determine the degree of the extension $[K : \\mathbb{Q}]$ and find a basis, we will construct the field extension in steps and apply the Tower Law.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the intermediate field $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$\n\nConsider the intermediate field $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The element $\\sqrt{2}$ is a root of the polynomial $p(x) = x^2 - 2$.\n\n1.  **Irreducibility**: The polynomial $x^2 - 2$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's Criterion (with prime $p=2$) or simply because $\\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.\n2.  **Degree**: Since $p(x)$ is the minimal polynomial of $\\sqrt{2}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, the degree of the extension is:\n    $$[L : \\mathbb{Q}] = [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) : \\mathbb{Q}] = \\deg(x^2 - 2) = 2$$\n3.  **Basis**: A basis for $L$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is given by $\\{1, \\sqrt{2}\\}$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the full extension $K = L(\\sqrt{3})$\n\nNow consider $K$ as an extension of $L$, i.e., $K = L(\\sqrt{3}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})(\\sqrt{3})$. The element $\\sqrt{3}$ is a root of the polynomial $q(x) = x^2 - 3$.\n\nTo determine the degree $[K : L]$, we must check if the polynomial $x^2 - 3$ is irreducible over $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Since the polynomial is quadratic, it is reducible over $L$ if and only if it has a root in $L$. That is, we must determine if $\\sqrt{3} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\n**Proposition**: $\\sqrt{3} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\n**Proof**:\nAssume, for the sake of contradiction, that $\\sqrt{3} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.

Thus, $2ab = 0$, which implies $a = 0$ or $b = 0$.\n\n*   **Case 1**: $b = 0$.\n    The equation becomes $3 = a^2$. This implies $\\sqrt{3} = |a|$. Since $a \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, this would mean $\\sqrt{3}$ is rational, which is false.\n*   **Case 2**: $a = 0$.\n    The equation becomes $3 = 2b^2$, which implies $b^2 = \\frac{3}{2}$.

The component $V_2$ defined by:\n    $$ \\begin{cases} x^2 + y^2 = -\\frac{\\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \\\\ z = -\\frac{\\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \\end{cases} $$",

Definition of a Lie Algebra\n\nA vector space $L$ over a field $F$ (here $F=\\mathbb{R}$) equipped with a bilinear operation (multiplication), typically denoted by $[x, y]$ or simply $xy$, is a Lie algebra if it satisfies the following two axioms for all $x, y, z \\in L$:\n\n1.  **Alternativity (or Skew-symmetry):**\n    $$[x, x] = 0$$\n    From this property, utilizing bilinearity, we can derive the **anticommutativity** property:\n    $$[x, y] = -[y, x]$$\n    (Note: Over a field of characteristic not equal to 2, such as $\\mathbb{R}$, alternativity and anticommutativity are equivalent).\n\n2.  **Jacobi Identity:**\n    $$[x, [y, z]] + [y, [z, x]] + [z, [x, y]] = 0$$\n\nIf the algebra $A$ violates any of these conditions, it is not a Lie algebra.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the Algebra $A$\n\nWe are given a basis $\\{e_1, e_2, e_3\\}$ for $A$ and the following multiplication rules:\n1.  $e_1 e_1 = e_2$\n2.  $e_1 e_2 = e_3$\n3.  $e_2 e_1 = -e_3$\n4.  $e_2 e_2 = e_1$\n5.  $e_3 e_1 = e_1$\n6.  $e_3 e_2 = e_2$\n7.  $e_3 e_3 = e_3$\n\nWe test the **Alternativity** axiom ($x x = 0$) using the basis vectors.\n\n**Test Case 1: $x = e_1$**\nAccording to the axioms of a Lie algebra, the product $e_1 e_1$ must be the zero vector $0$.\nHowever, Rule 1 states:\n$$e_1 e_1 = e_2$$\nSince $\\{e_1, e_2, e_3\\}$ is a basis for $A$, the vector $e_2$ is non-zero ($e_2 \\neq 0$).\nTherefore:\n$$e_1 e_1 \\neq 0$$\nThis violates the alternativity axiom.\n\n**Test Case 2: $x = e_3$**\nSimilarly, for a Lie algebra, we require $e_3 e_3 = 0$.\nRule 7 states:\n$$e_3 e_3 = e_3$$\nSince $e_3$ is a basis vector, $e_3 \\neq 0$.\nTherefore:\n$$e_3 e_3 \\neq 0$$\nThis is another violation of the alternativity axiom. Furthermore, this implies that $e_3$ is a non-zero idempotent, which does not exist in a Lie algebra.\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nA Lie algebra requires that the product of any element with itself is zero ($[x, x] = 0$). The multiplication defined on $A$ fails this condition for the basis vectors $e_1, e_2$, and $e_3$.

Definition of a Lie Algebra\n\nA vector space $L$ over a field $F$ (here $F=\\mathbb{R}$) equipped with a bilinear operation (multiplication), typically denoted by $[x, y]$ or simply $xy$, is a Lie algebra if it satisfies the following two axioms for all $x, y, z \\in L$:\n\n1.  **Alternativity (or Skew-symmetry):**\n    $$[x, x] = 0$$\n    From this property, utilizing bilinearity, we can derive the **anticommutativity** property:\n    $$[x, y] = -[y, x]$$\n    (Note: Over a field of characteristic not equal to 2, such as $\\mathbb{R}$, alternativity and anticommutativity are equivalent).\n\n2.  **Jacobi Identity:**\n    $$[x, [y, z]] + [y, [z, x]] + [z, [x, y]] = 0$$\n\nIf the algebra $A$ violates any of these conditions, it is not a Lie algebra.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the Algebra $A$\n\nWe are given a basis $\\{e_1, e_2, e_3\\}$ for $A$ and the following multiplication rules:\n1.  $e_1 e_1 = e_2$\n2.  $e_1 e_2 = e_3$\n3.  $e_2 e_1 = -e_3$\n4.  $e_2 e_2 = e_1$\n5.  $e_3 e_1 = e_1$\n6.  $e_3 e_2 = e_2$\n7.  $e_3 e_3 = e_3$\n\nWe test the **Alternativity** axiom ($x x = 0$) using the basis vectors.\n\n**Test Case 1: $x = e_1$**\nAccording to the axioms of a Lie algebra, the product $e_1 e_1$ must be the zero vector $0$.\nHowever, Rule 1 states:\n$$e_1 e_1 = e_2$$\nSince $\\{e_1, e_2, e_3\\}$ is a basis for $A$, the vector $e_2$ is non-zero ($e_2 \\neq 0$).\nTherefore:\n$$e_1 e_1 \\neq 0$$\nThis violates the alternativity axiom.\n\n**Test Case 2: $x = e_3$**\nSimilarly, for a Lie algebra, we require $e_3 e_3 = 0$.\nRule 7 states:\n$$e_3 e_3 = e_3$$\nSince $e_3$ is a basis vector, $e_3 \\neq 0$.\nTherefore:\n$$e_3 e_3 \\neq 0$$\nThis is another violation of the alternativity axiom.

Topological Structure of $G/H$\n\nLet $G$ be a connected Lie group of dimension $n$, and let $H$ be a closed subgroup of $G$. Let $\\pi: G \\to G/H$ be the canonical projection map defined by $g \\mapsto gH$. We equip $G/H$ with the **quotient topology**, where a set $U \\subset G/H$ is open if and only if $\\pi^{-1}(U)$ is open in $G$.\n\n**Hausdorff Property:**\nThe quotient space $G/H$ is Hausdorff if and only if the set $R = \\{(g_1, g_2) \\in G \\times G \\mid g_1 H = g_2 H\\}$ is closed in $G \\times G$. Note that $R$ is the inverse image of the closed set $H$ under the continuous map $f: G \\times G \\to G$ defined by $f(g_1, g_2) = g_1^{-1} g_2$. Specifically, $g_1 H = g_2 H \\iff g_1^{-1} g_2 \\in H$. Since $H$ is a closed subgroup of $G$ and $f$ is continuous, $R = f^{-1}(H)$ is closed. Therefore, $G/H$ is a Hausdorff space.\n\n**Second Countability:**\nSince $G$ is a Lie group (and thus a manifold), it is second countable. The projection $\\pi: G \\to G/H$ is an open map (a standard property of quotient maps by topological groups). The continuous open image of a second countable space is second countable. Thus, $G/H$ is second countable.\n\n### 2. Lie Algebraic Setup and the Slice Theorem\n\nBy the **Closed Subgroup Theorem** (Cartan's Theorem), every closed subgroup of a Lie group is an embedded Lie subgroup. Therefore, $H$ is a Lie group with a Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{h}$, which is a subalgebra of $\\mathfrak{g} = \\text{Lie}(G)$.\n\nLet $k = \\dim(H)$ and $n = \\dim(G)$. We identify $\\mathfrak{h}$ as a subspace of $\\mathfrak{g}$. We can choose a linear subspace $\\mathfrak{m} \\subset \\mathfrak{g}$ complementary to $\\mathfrak{h}$ such that:\n$$ \\mathfrak{g} = \\mathfrak{h} \\oplus \\mathfrak{m} $$\nNote that $\\dim(\\mathfrak{m}) = n - k$.\n\nConsider the map $\\Phi: \\mathfrak{m} \\times H \\to G$ defined by:\n$$ \\Phi(X, h) = \\exp(X) \\cdot h $$\nThis map is smooth. We verify its differential at the point $(0, e) \\in \\mathfrak{m} \\times H$, identifying the tangent space $T_{(0,e)}(\\mathfrak{m} \\times H)$ with $\\mathfrak{m} \\oplus \\mathfrak{h}$.\n$$ d\\Phi_{(0,e)}(X, Y) = X + Y \\quad \\text{for } X \\in \\mathfrak{m}, Y \\in \\mathfrak{h} $$\nSince $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathfrak{h} \\oplus \\mathfrak{m}$, the differential $d\\Phi_{(0,e)}$ is a linear isomorphism. By the **Inverse Function Theorem**, there exist open neighborhoods $V_{\\mathfrak{m}} \\subset \\mathfrak{m}$ of $0$, $W_H \\subset H$ of $e$, and $U \\subset G$ of $e$ such that $\\Phi: V_{\\mathfrak{m}} \\times W_H \\to U$ is a diffeomorphism.\n\n### 3. Construction of Smooth Charts\n\nWe construct a coordinate chart for $G/H$ near the identity coset $eH$.\n\nLet $V = V_{\\mathfrak{m}}$ be the neighborhood of $0$ in $\\mathfrak{m}$ found above. We define a map $\\psi: V \\to G/H$ by:\n$$ \\psi(X) = \\pi(\\exp(X)) = \\exp(X)H $$\n**Injectivity:**\nSuppose $\\psi(X_1) = \\psi(X_2)$ for $X_1, X_2 \\in V$. Then $\\exp(X_1)H = \\exp(X_2)H$, which implies $\\exp(X_1) = \\exp(X_2)h$ for some $h \\in H$.\nSince $\\exp(X_1), \\exp(X_2) \\in \\Phi(V \\times \\{e\\}) \\subset U$ and the decomposition in $U \\cong V \\times W_H$ is unique, we have:\n$$ \\Phi(X_1, e) = \\exp(X_1) = \\exp(X_2)h = \\Phi(X_2, h) $$\nDue to the injectivity of $\\Phi$ on $V \\times W_H$ (assuming we restrict $V$ sufficiently such that $\\exp(V)^{-1}\\exp(V) \\cap H \\subseteq W_H$), we must have $X_1 = X_2$ and $h = e$. Thus, $\\psi$ is injective.\n\n**Homeomorphism:**\nThe map $\\psi$ is a continuous bijection onto its image $\\pi(U)$. The image $\\pi(U)$ is open in $G/H$ because $U$ is open in $G$ and $\\pi$ is an open map. The inverse map $\\psi^{-1}: \\pi(U) \\to V$ is continuous because it corresponds to the projection of the smooth inverse $\\Phi^{-1}|_{\\exp(V)}$ onto the $\\mathfrak{m}$-component. Thus, $\\phi = \\psi^{-1}$ is a homeomorphism from the open set $\\mathcal{U}_e = \\pi(U) \\subset G/H$ to $V \\subset \\mathfrak{m} \\cong \\mathbb{R}^{n-k}$.\n\n**Atlas Construction:**\nThis creates a chart $(\\mathcal{U}_e, \\phi)$ around the identity coset. To cover $G/H$, we use left translations. For any $g \\in G$, the left translation map $L_g: G/H \\to G/H$ is a homeomorphism. We define charts around $gH$ by $(\\mathcal{U}_g, \\phi_g)$ where:\n$$ \\mathcal{U}_g = g \\cdot \\mathcal{U}_e = \\{g x H \\mid xH \\in \\mathcal{U}_e\\} $$\n$$ \\phi_g(yH) = \\phi(g^{-1} y H) $$\nThe collection $\\{(\\mathcal{U}_g, \\phi_g)\\}_{g \\in G}$ covers $G/H$ and forms an atlas.\n\n### 4. Smoothness of Transition Maps\n\nLet $(\\mathcal{U}_{g_1}, \\phi_{g_1})$ and $(\\mathcal{U}_{g_2}, \\phi_{g_2})$ be two overlapping charts. We must show that the transition map $\\phi_{g_2} \\circ \\phi_{g_1}^{-1}$ is smooth on its domain.\nThe domain is $\\phi_{g_1}(\\mathcal{U}_{g_1} \\cap \\mathcal{U}_{g_2}) \\subset V \\subset \\mathfrak{m}$.\nLet $X \\in \\text{domain}$. Then:\n$$ \\phi_{g_1}^{-1}(X) = g_1 \\exp(X) H $$\nApplying $\\phi_{g_2}$:\n$$ (\\phi_{g_2} \\circ \\phi_{g_1}^{-1})(X) = \\phi_{g_2}(g_1 \\exp(X) H) = \\phi(g_2^{-1} g_1 \\exp(X) H) $$\nLet $k(X) = g_2^{-1} g_1 \\exp(X)$. For $X$ in the domain, $k(X)H \\in \\mathcal{U}_e$, which means $k(X)$ can be decomposed uniquely in $U$ (possibly after adjusting domains) as:\n$$ k(X) = \\exp(X') h $$\nwhere $X' \\in V$ and $h \\in W_H$. By definition, $\\phi(k(X)H) = X'$.\nThe mapping $X \\mapsto X'$ is determined by the equation:\n$$ g_2^{-1} g_1 \\exp(X) = \\exp(X') h $$\nRecall the diffeomorphism $\\Phi^{-1}: U \\to V \\times W_H$. Let $\\text{pr}_{\\mathfrak{m}}: V \\times W_H \\to V$ be the smooth projection onto the first factor. Then:\n$$ X' = \\text{pr}_{\\mathfrak{m}}(\\Phi^{-1}(g_2^{-1} g_1 \\exp(X))) $$\nSince group multiplication, the exponential map, and $\\Phi^{-1}$ are all smooth, the composition yielding $X'$ is smooth with respect to $X$. Thus, the transition functions are smooth.\n\n### 5. Conclusion and Dimension\n\nWe have constructed a Hausdorff, second-countable topological space equipped with a smooth atlas. Therefore, $G/H$ is a smooth manifold.\n\nThe charts map open sets of $G/H$ to open sets of the vector space $\\mathfrak{m}$. Since $\\mathfrak{m}$ was chosen as a complement to $\\mathfrak{h}$ in $\\mathfrak{g}$, we have:\n$$ \\dim(G/H) = \\dim(\\mathfrak{m}) = \\dim(\\mathfrak{g}) - \\dim(\\mathfrak{h}) $$\nAlternatively, denoting dimensions as $\\dim(G)$ and $\\dim(H)$:\n\n**Answer:**\nThe quotient space $G/H$ is a smooth manifold.

Therefore:\n$$ z^2 + z - 2 = (z - 1)(z + 2) $$\n\nAlternatively, using the quadratic formula:\n$$ z = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2 - 4(1)(-2)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 8}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm 3}{2} $$\nThis yields two solutions:\n$$ z_1 = \\frac{-1 + 3}{2} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1 $$\n$$ z_2 = \\frac{-1 - 3}{2} = \\frac{-4}{2} = -2 $$\n\n### Step 4: Combine Results and Determine Multiplicities\nSubstituting the factored form of the quadratic back into the expression for $f(z)$, we get:\n$$ f(z) = (z - 1) \\cdot (z - 1)(z + 2) = (z - 1)^2 (z + 2) $$\n\nTo find the roots, we set $f(z) = 0$:\n1.  $(z - 1)^2 = 0 \\implies z = 1$. Since the factor is squared, this root has a multiplicity of 2.\n2.  $(z + 2) = 0 \\implies z = -2$. This root has a multiplicity of 1.\n\n### Verification\nWe check the roots using Vieta's formulas for the polynomial $z^3 + 0z^2 - 3z + 2 = 0$:\n-   Sum of roots: $1 + 1 + (-2) = 0$. This matches the coefficient of $z^2$ (which is $0$) negated.\n-   Product of roots: $1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-2) = -2$. This matches the constant term ($2$) multiplied by $(-1)^n = -1$.\n\nBoth checks confirm the result.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe roots of the polynomial $f(z) = z^3 - 3z + 2$ are:\n\n**$z = 1$ (with multiplicity 2)**\n**$z = -2$ (with multiplicity 1)**",

The function derived above is one valid member of the infinite set of solutions (which includes, for example, $u(x, y) = e^{-y}\\sin(x)$ and $u(x,y) = e^y\\sin(x) + Cy$).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nA function satisfying the conditions is:\n\n$$ u(x, y) = e^y \\sin(x) $$",

Analysis of the Recurrence Relation\n\nThe recurrence relation relates $f(n+2)$ to $f(n)$. This \"step-2\" property implies that the values of $f$ on the even integers ($\\dots, -2, 0, 2, \\dots$) are determined independently of the values on the odd integers ($\\dots, -1, 1, 3, \\dots$). The set of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$ is partitioned into two disjoint sets based on parity (even and odd), and the recurrence operates within each set separately.\n\nWe can solve this problem by finding the general solution to the linear difference equation or by summation on the separate parity classes. We will use the method of particular and homogeneous solutions.\n\nThe equation is a linear non-homogeneous difference equation of the form:\n$$f(n+2) - f(n) = 2n + 3$$\n\n### 2. Particular Solution\n\nWe search for a particular solution $f_p(n)$ that satisfies the non-homogeneous equation. Since the non-homogeneous term $2n+3$ is a polynomial of degree 1, we try a polynomial of degree 2, $f_p(n) = An^2 + Bn$.\n\nSubstituting this into the recurrence:\n$$A(n+2)^2 + B(n+2) - (An^2 + Bn) = 2n + 3$$\n$$A(n^2 + 4n + 4) + (Bn + 2B) - An^2 - Bn = 2n + 3$$\n$$4An + (4A + 2B) = 2n + 3$$\n\nComparing coefficients of powers of $n$:\n1.  Coefficient of $n$: $4A = 2 \\implies A = \\frac{1}{2}$\n2.  Constant term: $4A + 2B = 3 \\implies 4(\\frac{1}{2}) + 2B = 3 \\implies 2 + 2B = 3 \\implies B = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nThus, a particular solution is:\n$$f_p(n) = \\frac{1}{2}n^2 + \\frac{1}{2}n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$\n\n### 3. Homogeneous Solution\n\nThe associated homogeneous equation is:\n$$f_h(n+2) - f_h(n) = 0 \\implies f_h(n+2) = f_h(n)$$\nThis implies that $f_h(n)$ is a periodic function with period 2. It depends only on the parity of $n$. We can express this as:\n$$f_h(n) = \\begin{cases} C_0 & \\text{if } n \\text{ is even} \\\\ C_1 & \\text{if } n \\text{ is odd} \\end{cases}$$\nwhere $C_0$ and $C_1$ are arbitrary constants.\n\n### 4. General Solution\n\nThe general solution is the sum of the particular and homogeneous solutions:\n$$f(n) = f_p(n) + f_h(n) = \\frac{n^2+n}{2} + \\begin{cases} C_0 & \\text{if } n \\text{ is even} \\\\ C_1 & \\text{if } n \\text{ is odd} \\end{cases}$$\n\n### 5. Applying Initial Conditions\n\nWe are given $f(0) = 1$. Since $0$ is even:\n$$f(0) = \\frac{0^2+0}{2} + C_0 = 1 \\implies C_0 = 1$$\n\nThus, for even integers $n$, the function is uniquely determined:\n$$f(n) = \\frac{n^2+n}{2} + 1 = \\frac{n^2+n+2}{2}$$\n\n**Missing Constraint for Odd Integers:**\nThe problem provides no value for $f(n)$ when $n$ is odd (e.g., $f(1)$). The recurrence relation never links an even input to an odd input. Therefore, $C_1$ remains an arbitrary integer constant. Let $C_1 = k$ where $k$ is an integer determining the value of $f(1)$. Specifically, $f(1) = 1 + k$.\n\n### 6. Well-Posedness Statement\n\nThe question asks for \"**the** explicit formula\", implying a unique solution. However, because the recurrence partitions the domain into two independent sets (evens and odds) and an initial condition is provided only for the even set, the solution is not unique. The problem is **ill-posed** with respect to finding a unique function. There are infinitely many functions satisfying the conditions, parameterized by the choice of $f(1)$.\n\nWe provide the general explicit formula representing the family of all solutions.\n\n### Final Result\n\nThe values of $f(n)$ are given by:\n$$f(n) = \\frac{n^2 + n}{2} + \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } n \\text{ is even} \\\\ C & \\text{if } n \\text{ is odd} \\end{cases}$$\nwhere $C$ is an arbitrary integer constant. (If we define $C = f(1) - 1$, then $C$ is simply determined by the choice of $f(1)$).\n\nWe can write this as a single formula using the parity indicator:\n$$f(n) = \\frac{n^2+n+2}{2} + (C-1)(n \\bmod 2)$$\nOr alternatively using $(-1)^n$:\n$$f(n) = \\frac{n^2+n}{2} + \\frac{1+C}{2} + \\frac{1-C}{2}(-1)^n$$\n\nIf we assume the simplest case where $f(n)$ is a polynomial (which implies the periodic part must be constant, i.e., $C=1$), the unique solution would be $f(n) = \\frac{n^2+n+2}{2}$. However, without this assumption, the general solution stands.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nFor even $n$, $f(n) = \\frac{n^2+n+2}{2}$.\nFor odd $n$, $f(n) = \\frac{n^2+n}{2} + C$ for some arbitrary integer constant $C$.",

Coefficient of $n$: $4A = 2 \\implies A = \\frac{1}{2}$\n2.

We can express this as:\n$$f_h(n) = \\begin{cases} C_0 & \\text{if } n \\text{ is even} \\\\ C_1 & \\text{if } n \\text{ is odd} \\end{cases}$$\nwhere $C_0$ and $C_1$ are arbitrary constants.\n\n### 4. General Solution\n\nThe general solution is the sum of the particular and homogeneous solutions:\n$$f(n) = f_p(n) + f_h(n) = \\frac{n^2+n}{2} + \\begin{cases} C_0 & \\text{if } n \\text{ is even} \\\\ C_1 & \\text{if } n \\text{ is odd} \\end{cases}$$\n\n### 5. Applying Initial Conditions\n\nWe are given $f(0) = 1$. Since $0$ is even:\n$$f(0) = \\frac{0^2+0}{2} + C_0 = 1 \\implies C_0 = 1$$\n\nThus, for even integers $n$, the function is uniquely determined:\n$$f(n) = \\frac{n^2+n}{2} + 1 = \\frac{n^2+n+2}{2}$$\n\n**Missing Constraint for Odd Integers:**\nThe problem provides no value for $f(n)$ when $n$ is odd (e.g., $f(1)$). The recurrence relation never links an even input to an odd input. Therefore, $C_1$ remains an arbitrary integer constant. Let $C_1 = k$ where $k$ is an integer determining the value of $f(1)$. Specifically, $f(1) = 1 + k$.\n\n### 6. Well-Posedness Statement\n\nThe question asks for \"**the** explicit formula\", implying a unique solution. However, because the recurrence partitions the domain into two independent sets (evens and odds) and an initial condition is provided only for the even set, the solution is not unique. The problem is **ill-posed** with respect to finding a unique function. There are infinitely many functions satisfying the conditions, parameterized by the choice of $f(1)$.\n\nWe provide the general explicit formula representing the family of all solutions.\n\n### Final Result\n\nThe values of $f(n)$ are given by:\n$$f(n) = \\frac{n^2 + n}{2} + \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } n \\text{ is even} \\\\ C & \\text{if } n \\text{ is odd} \\end{cases}$$\nwhere $C$ is an arbitrary integer constant. (If we define $C = f(1) - 1$, then $C$ is simply determined by the choice of $f(1)$).\n\nWe can write this as a single formula using the parity indicator:\n$$f(n) = \\frac{n^2+n+2}{2} + (C-1)(n \\bmod 2)$$\nOr alternatively using $(-1)^n$:\n$$f(n) = \\frac{n^2+n}{2} + \\frac{1+C}{2} + \\frac{1-C}{2}(-1)^n$$\n\nIf we assume the simplest case where $f(n)$ is a polynomial (which implies the periodic part must be constant, i.e., $C=1$), the unique solution would be $f(n) = \\frac{n^2+n+2}{2}$. However, without this assumption, the general solution stands.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nFor even $n$, $f(n) = \\frac{n^2+n+2}{2}$.\nFor odd $n$, $f(n) = \\frac{n^2+n}{2} + C$ for some arbitrary integer constant $C$.",

Evaluation of the One-Dimensional Integral $I(k)$\n\nWe evaluate $I(k)$ by completing the square in the exponent of the integrand. The exponent is:\n$$ -t^2 - 2\\pi i t k = -\\left( t^2 + 2\\pi i k t \\right). $$\nAdding and subtracting $(\\pi i k)^2 = -\\pi^2 k^2$ inside the parenthesis to complete the square:\n$$ -\\left( t^2 + 2\\pi i k t + (\\pi i k)^2 - (\\pi i k)^2 \\right) = -\\left( (t + \\pi i k)^2 + \\pi^2 k^2 \\right) = -(t + \\pi i k)^2 - \\pi^2 k^2. $$\nSubstituting this back into the integral:\n$$ I(k) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-(t + \\pi i k)^2 - \\pi^2 k^2} \\, dt = e^{-\\pi^2 k^2} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-(t + \\pi i k)^2} \\, dt. $$\n\nNow, consider the integral $J = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-(t + \\pi i k)^2} \\, dt$.\nLet us consider the complex function $h(z) = e^{-z^2}$. We integrate this function along a rectangular contour $C$ in the complex plane with vertices at $-R, R, R + i\\pi k, -R + i\\pi k$. Since $e^{-z^2}$ is an entire function (holomorphic everywhere), by Cauchy's Integral Theorem, the contour integral is zero:\n$$ \\oint_C e^{-z^2} \\, dz = 0. $$\nThis breaks down into four segments:\n1.  From $-R$ to $R$ on the real axis: $\\int_{-R}^{R} e^{-x^2} \\, dx$.\n2.  Vertical segment at $R$: $\\int_{0}^{\\pi k} e^{-(R + iy)^2} i \\, dy$.\n3.

Vertical segment at $-R$: $\\int_{\\pi k}^{0} e^{-(-R + iy)^2} i \\, dy$.\n\nAs $R \\to \\infty$, the integrals over the vertical segments vanish. For the right vertical segment (where $z = R + iy$), the magnitude of the integrand is $|e^{-(R^2 - y^2 + 2iRy)}| = e^{-R^2 + y^2}$. Since $y$ is bounded between $0$ and $\\pi k$, $e^{-R^2 + y^2} \\le e^{-R^2} e^{\\pi^2 k^2}$, which goes to 0 as $R \\to \\infty$. The same logic applies to the left vertical segment.\n\nTherefore, in the limit as $R \\to \\infty$:\n$$ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-x^2} \\, dx - \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-(t + i\\pi k)^2} \\, dt = 0 $$\n$$ \\implies \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-(t + i\\pi k)^2} \\, dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-x^2} \\, dx. $$\nThis is the standard Gaussian integral, the value of which is known to be $\\sqrt{\\pi}$.\n\nThus, we have:\n$$ I(k) = e^{-\\pi^2 k^2} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\pi} = \\sqrt{\\pi} e^{-\\pi^2 k^2}. $$\n\n### 3.

This can be factored as the product of two functions of a single variable:\n$$ f(x, y) = e^{-x^2} e^{-y^2}. $$\nThe kernel of the Fourier transform is also separable:\n$$ e^{-2\\pi i (x \\xi + y \\eta)} = e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} e^{-2\\pi i y \\eta}. $$\nThe integral is defined over $\\mathbb{R}^2$, and since $|f(x, y)| = e^{-(x^2+y^2)}$ is integrable on $\\mathbb{R}^2$ (it belongs to $L^1(\\mathbb{R}^2)$), we can apply Fubini's Theorem to write the double integral as a product of two single-variable integrals:\n\n$$ \\mathcal{F}\\{f\\}(\\xi, \\eta) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-x^2} e^{-y^2} e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} e^{-2\\pi i y \\eta} \\, dx \\, dy $$\n$$ \\mathcal{F}\\{f\\}(\\xi, \\eta) = \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-x^2} e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} \\, dx \\right) \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-y^2} e^{-2\\pi i y \\eta} \\, dy \\right). $$\n\nLet us define the one-dimensional Fourier transform of the Gaussian $g(t) = e^{-t^2}$ as:\n$$ I(k) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-t^2} e^{-2\\pi i t k} \\, dt. $$\nThen, our desired result is $\\mathcal{F}\\{f\\}(\\xi, \\eta) = I(\\xi) I(\\eta)$.\n\n### 2. Evaluation of the One-Dimensional Integral $I(k)$\n\nWe evaluate $I(k)$ by completing the square in the exponent of the integrand. The exponent is:\n$$ -t^2 - 2\\pi i t k = -\\left( t^2 + 2\\pi i k t \\right). $$\nAdding and subtracting $(\\pi i k)^2 = -\\pi^2 k^2$ inside the parenthesis to complete the square:\n$$ -\\left( t^2 + 2\\pi i k t + (\\pi i k)^2 - (\\pi i k)^2 \\right) = -\\left( (t + \\pi i k)^2 + \\pi^2 k^2 \\right) = -(t + \\pi i k)^2 - \\pi^2 k^2. $$\nSubstituting this back into the integral:\n$$ I(k) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-(t + \\pi i k)^2 - \\pi^2 k^2} \\, dt = e^{-\\pi^2 k^2} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-(t + \\pi i k)^2} \\, dt. $$\n\nNow, consider the integral $J = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-(t + \\pi i k)^2} \\, dt$.\nLet us consider the complex function $h(z) = e^{-z^2}$. We integrate this function along a rectangular contour $C$ in the complex plane with vertices at $-R, R, R + i\\pi k, -R + i\\pi k$. Since $e^{-z^2}$ is an entire function (holomorphic everywhere), by Cauchy's Integral Theorem, the contour integral is zero:\n$$ \\oint_C e^{-z^2} \\, dz = 0. $$\nThis breaks down into four segments:\n1.  From $-R$ to $R$ on the real axis: $\\int_{-R}^{R} e^{-x^2} \\, dx$.\n2.  Vertical segment at $R$: $\\int_{0}^{\\pi k} e^{-(R + iy)^2} i \\, dy$.\n3.  From $R + i\\pi k$ to $-R + i\\pi k$: $-\\int_{-R}^{R} e^{-(t + i\\pi k)^2} \\, dt$.\n4.  Vertical segment at $-R$: $\\int_{\\pi k}^{0} e^{-(-R + iy)^2} i \\, dy$.\n\nAs $R \\to \\infty$, the integrals over the vertical segments vanish. For the right vertical segment (where $z = R + iy$), the magnitude of the integrand is $|e^{-(R^2 - y^2 + 2iRy)}| = e^{-R^2 + y^2}$. Since $y$ is bounded between $0$ and $\\pi k$, $e^{-R^2 + y^2} \\le e^{-R^2} e^{\\pi^2 k^2}$, which goes to 0 as $R \\to \\infty$. The same logic applies to the left vertical segment.\n\nTherefore, in the limit as $R \\to \\infty$:\n$$ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-x^2} \\, dx - \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-(t + i\\pi k)^2} \\, dt = 0 $$\n$$ \\implies \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-(t + i\\pi k)^2} \\, dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-x^2} \\, dx. $$\nThis is the standard Gaussian integral, the value of which is known to be $\\sqrt{\\pi}$.\n\nThus, we have:\n$$ I(k) = e^{-\\pi^2 k^2} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\pi} = \\sqrt{\\pi} e^{-\\pi^2 k^2}. $$\n\n### 3. Combining the Results\n\nWe substitute the expression for $I(k)$ back into the product derived in Step 1:\n$$ \\mathcal{F}\\{f\\}(\\xi, \\eta) = I(\\xi) I(\\eta) $$\n$$ \\mathcal{F}\\{f\\}(\\xi, \\eta) = \\left( \\sqrt{\\pi} e^{-\\pi^2 \\xi^2} \\right) \\left( \\sqrt{\\pi} e^{-\\pi^2 \\eta^2} \\right) $$\n$$ \\mathcal{F}\\{f\\}(\\xi, \\eta) = \\pi e^{-\\pi^2 \\xi^2} e^{-\\pi^2 \\eta^2} $$\n$$ \\mathcal{F}\\{f\\}(\\xi, \\eta) = \\pi e^{-\\pi^2 (\\xi^2 + \\eta^2)}. $$\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe exact value of the Fourier transform $\\mathcal{F}\\{f\\}(\\xi, \\eta)$ for all $(\\xi, \\eta) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ is:\n\n$$ \\mathcal{F}\\{f\\}(\\xi, \\eta) = \\pi e^{-\\pi^2 (\\xi^2 + \\eta^2)} $$",

Proof for $n \\geq 6$\n\nWe prove that for any convex polygon with $n \\geq 6$ vertices labeled distinctively with $\\{1, \\ldots, n\\}$, there exists a diagonal with weight at least $k = \\lceil n/2 \\rceil$.\n\n**Proof by Contradiction:**\nAssume that for a given $n \\geq 6$, there exists a labeling such that every diagonal has weight strictly less than $k$.\nThis implies that any pair of vertices $\\{u, v\\}$ with weight $|L(u) - L(v)| \\geq k$ must be connected by an **edge** of the polygon. If they were connected by a diagonal, the diagonal would satisfy the condition we are trying to avoid.\n\nLet $S$ be the set of pairs of labels with difference at least $k$:\n$$ S = \\big\\{ \\{x, y\\} \\subseteq \\{1, \\ldots, n\\} : |x - y| \\geq k \\big\\} $$\nBy our assumption, every pair in $S$ must correspond to an edge of the polygon. In the graph of the polygon (which is a cycle $C_n$), the degree of every vertex is exactly 2. Therefore, if $S$ is a subset of the edges, the degree of any vertex in the graph defined by $S$ must be at most 2.\n\nConsider the vertex labeled $1$. We identify its neighbors in the set $S$.\nA label $y$ is connected to $1$ in $S$ if $|1 - y| \\geq k$, which simplifies to $y - 1 \\geq k$ (since $y > 1$).\nSo, $y \\geq k + 1$.\nThe possible values for $y$ are $\\{k+1, k+2, \\ldots, n\\}$.\nThe number of such neighbors (the degree of label 1 in $S$) is:\n$$ \\deg_S(1) = n - (k+1) + 1 = n - k $$\n\nFor $S$ to be a subset of the polygon's edges, we must have $\\deg_S(1) \\leq 2$. Thus, we require:\n$$ n - k \\leq 2 \\implies n - \\lceil n/2 \\rceil \\leq 2 $$\n\nLet's test this inequality for $n \\geq 6$:\n\n1.  **If $n$ is even**, let $n = 2m$ where $m \\geq 3$ (since $n \\geq 6$).\n    Then $k = \\lceil 2m/2 \\rceil = m$.\n    The condition becomes:\n    $$ 2m - m \\leq 2 \\implies m \\leq 2 $$\n    This contradicts $m \\geq 3$.

Define the punctured manifold:\n$$ M_\\epsilon = M \\setminus \\bigcup_{i=1}^k \\operatorname{int}(D_i(\\epsilon)) $$\nOn $M_\\epsilon$, the vector field $X$ is non-vanishing.

Let $e_2(p)$ be the unique unit vector orthogonal to $e_1(p)$ such that $\\{e_1, e_2\\}$ agrees with the orientation of $M$.\n\nLet $\\omega_{12}$ be the **connection 1-form** associated with this frame field.

Comparison and Discussion\n\nTo determine which approximation is likely to be more accurate, we consider the error bounds for each method and the properties of the function $f(x) = e^{-x^2}$.\n\n**Theoretical Error Analysis:**\n1.  **Trapezoidal Rule Error ($E_T$):** The error term is given by $E_T = -\\frac{(b-a)^3}{12n^2} f''(\\xi)$ for some $\\xi \\in [a,b]$. The error is of order **$O(h^2)$**.\n2.  **Simpson's Rule Error ($E_S$):** The error term is given by $E_S = -\\frac{(b-a)^5}{180n^4} f^{(4)}(\\xi)$ for some $\\xi \\in [a,b]$. The error is of order **$O(h^4)$**.\n\nSince the step size $h = 0.25$ is less than 1, $h^4$ is significantly smaller than $h^2$ ($0.0039$ vs $0.0625$). Because $f(x) = e^{-x^2}$ is a smooth ($C^\\infty$) function on $[0,1]$, its derivatives are bounded, ensuring that the theoretical advantages of the higher-order method hold. Therefore, Simpson's Rule is expected to provide a much tighter approximation.\n\n**Verification against the True Value:**\nThe integral $I = \\int_0^1 e^{-x^2} dx$ relates to the error function, $\\text{erf}(x)$, specifically $I = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2} \\text{erf}(1)$.\nThe precise value is approximately **0.746824**.\n\nComparing our results:\n-   **Trapezoidal Error:** $|0.746824 - 0.742984| \\approx 0.00384$\n-   **Simpson's Error:** $|0.746824 - 0.746855| \\approx 0.000031$\n\n**Conclusion:**\n**Simpson's Rule** is more accurate. This is because Simpson's Rule utilizes quadratic interpolation (parabolas) to approximate the function curve, whereas the Trapezoidal Rule uses linear interpolation (straight lines). For a smooth, curved function like $e^{-x^2}$, quadratic approximations capture the curvature much better, resulting in an error convergence rate of $O(h^4)$ compared to $O(h^2)$ for the Trapezoidal Rule.",

Approximation using the Trapezoidal Rule\n\nThe formula for the Trapezoidal Rule with $n$ subintervals is:\n$$ T_n = \\frac{h}{2} \\left[ y_0 + 2\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} y_i + y_n \\right] $$\n\nSubstituting our values for $n=4$:\n$$ T_4 = \\frac{0.25}{2} \\left[ y_0 + 2(y_1 + y_2 + y_3) + y_4 \\right] $$\n$$ T_4 = 0.125 \\left[ 1 + 2(0.939413 + 0.778801 + 0.569783) + 0.367879 \\right] $$\n\nFirst, compute the sum of the interior terms:\n$$ \\Sigma_{\\text{interior}} = 0.939413 + 0.778801 + 0.569783 = 2.287997 $$\n\nSubstitute back into the formula:\n$$ T_4 = 0.125 \\left[ 1 + 2(2.287997) + 0.367879 \\right] $$\n$$ T_4 = 0.125 \\left[ 1 + 4.575994 + 0.367879 \\right] $$\n$$ T_4 = 0.125 \\left[ 5.943873 \\right] $$\n$$ T_4 \\approx 0.742984 $$\n\n**Result for Part 1:**\nThe Trapezoidal Rule approximation is **0.742984**.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Approximation using Simpson's Rule\n\nThe formula for Simpson's Rule (where $n$ is even) is:\n$$ S_n = \\frac{h}{3} \\left[ y_0 + 4\\sum_{i \\text{ odd}} y_i + 2\\sum_{j \\text{ even}} y_j + y_n \\right] $$\n\nSubstituting our values for $n=4$:\n$$ S_4 = \\frac{0.25}{3} \\left[ y_0 + 4(y_1 + y_3) + 2(y_2) + y_4 \\right] $$\n\nCompute the bracketed sum component by component:\n1.  **Endpoints:**\n    $$ y_0 + y_4 = 1 + 0.367879 = 1.367879 $$\n\n2.  **Odd indexed terms ($y_1, y_3$):**\n    $$ 4(0.939413 + 0.569783) = 4(1.509196) = 6.036784 $$\n\n3.  **Even indexed terms ($y_2$):**\n    $$ 2(0.778801) = 1.557602 $$\n\nCombine the components:\n$$ \\text{Total Sum} = 1.367879 + 6.036784 + 1.557602 = 8.962265 $$\n\nMultiply by $\\frac{h}{3}$:\n$$ S_4 = \\frac{0.25}{3} \\times 8.962265 = \\frac{1}{12} \\times 8.962265 $$\n$$ S_4 \\approx 0.746855 $$\n\n**Result for Part 2:**\nSimpson's Rule approximation is **0.746855**.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Comparison and Discussion\n\nTo determine which approximation is likely to be more accurate, we consider the error bounds for each method and the properties of the function $f(x) = e^{-x^2}$.\n\n**Theoretical Error Analysis:**\n1.  **Trapezoidal Rule Error ($E_T$):** The error term is given by $E_T = -\\frac{(b-a)^3}{12n^2} f''(\\xi)$ for some $\\xi \\in [a,b]$. The error is of order **$O(h^2)$**.\n2.  **Simpson's Rule Error ($E_S$):** The error term is given by $E_S = -\\frac{(b-a)^5}{180n^4} f^{(4)}(\\xi)$ for some $\\xi \\in [a,b]$. The error is of order **$O(h^4)$**.\n\nSince the step size $h = 0.25$ is less than 1, $h^4$ is significantly smaller than $h^2$ ($0.0039$ vs $0.0625$). Because $f(x) = e^{-x^2}$ is a smooth ($C^\\infty$) function on $[0,1]$, its derivatives are bounded, ensuring that the theoretical advantages of the higher-order method hold. Therefore, Simpson's Rule is expected to provide a much tighter approximation.\n\n**Verification against the True Value:**\nThe integral $I = \\int_0^1 e^{-x^2} dx$ relates to the error function, $\\text{erf}(x)$, specifically $I = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2} \\text{erf}(1)$.\nThe precise value is approximately **0.746824**.\n\nComparing our results:\n-   **Trapezoidal Error:** $|0.746824 - 0.742984| \\approx 0.00384$\n-   **Simpson's Error:** $|0.746824 - 0.746855| \\approx 0.000031$\n\n**Conclusion:**\n**Simpson's Rule** is more accurate. This is because Simpson's Rule utilizes quadratic interpolation (parabolas) to approximate the function curve, whereas the Trapezoidal Rule uses linear interpolation (straight lines). For a smooth, curved function like $e^{-x^2}$, quadratic approximations capture the curvature much better, resulting in an error convergence rate of $O(h^4)$ compared to $O(h^2)$ for the Trapezoidal Rule.",
