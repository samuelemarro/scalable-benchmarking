For any valid subset $A$, there are two mutually exclusive cases regarding $n$:\n\n**Case 1: $n \\notin A$**\nIf $n$ is not included in $A$, then $A$ must be a valid subset of $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, n-1\\}$. By definition, there are $a_{n-1}$ such subsets.\n\n**Case 2: $n \\in A$**\nIf $n$ is included in $A$, then $n-1$ cannot be in $A$ because consecutive integers are not allowed. Therefore, the remaining elements of $A$ must be a valid subset of $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, n-2\\}$.

Let $k(k + 1) = 2m$ for some integer $m$.\n\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $p^2$:\n$$p^2 = 4(2m) + 1 = 8m + 1$$\n\nTherefore:\n$$p^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$$\n\nThus, $p^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$ holds for all primes $p > 3$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe have established that:\n1. $p^2 - 1$ is divisible by 3.\n2. $p^2 - 1$ is divisible by 8.\n\nSince 3 and 8 are coprime ($\\gcd(3, 8) = 1$), $p^2 - 1$ is divisible by their product, $3 \\times 8 = 24$.\n\nTherefore, $p^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{24}$.\n\n**Q.E.D.**",

Hence, $V_1$ is an irreducible algebraic set.\n\n**Analyzing $V_2$:**\nSimilarly, $V_2$ is defined by the ideal $J_2 = \\langle x^2 + y^2 - z_2, z - z_2 \\rangle$.\nThis represents a conic section in the plane $z = z_2$.\nSince $z_2 \\neq 0$, the polynomial $x^2 + y^2 - z_2$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{C}$. Thus, $V_2$ is also an irreducible algebraic set.\n\nSince $z_1 \\neq z_2$, the sets $V_1$ and $V_2$ are disjoint. Therefore, neither is contained in the other, and they are indeed the irreducible components of $V$.\n\n### 3. Dimension of the Variety\n\nThe dimension of an affine variety is the maximum of the dimensions of its irreducible components.\n- $V_1$ is an irreducible curve (hypersurface in a 2D plane defined by one equation), so $\\dim(V_1) = 1$.\n- $V_2$ is an irreducible curve, so $\\dim(V_2) = 1$.\n\nThus, $\\dim(V) = 1$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n**Dimension:**\nThe dimension of $V$ is **1**.\n\n**Irreducible Components:**\nThe variety $V$ has two irreducible components, which are disjoint conics lying in parallel planes parallel to the $xy$-plane. They are given by:\n\n1.  The component $V_1$ defined by:\n    $$ \\begin{cases} x^2 + y^2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{5} - 1}{2} \\\\ z = \\frac{\\sqrt{5} - 1}{2} \\end{cases} $$\n\n2.  The component $V_2$ defined by:\n    $$ \\begin{cases} x^2 + y^2 = -\\frac{\\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \\\\ z = -\\frac{\\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \\end{cases} $$",

Then there exists a unitary $u \\in A$ such that $u p u^* = q$. Consequently, $E_p \\cong E_q$.\n\n**Proof of Lemma:**\nWe construct the specific unitary that \"rotates\" the subspace $\\text{Im}(p)$ to $\\text{Im}(q)$. Consider the element $z \\in A$ defined by:\n$$ z = qp + (1-q)(1-p) $$\nFirst, we verify that $z$ intertwines $p$ and $q$:\n$$ zp = (qp + (1-q)(1-p))p = qp $$\n$$ qz = q(qp + 1 - p - q + qp) = qp + q - qp - q + qp = qp $$\nThus, $zp = qz$.\n\nNext, we show that $z$ is invertible.

Homotopy Argument\n\nLet $p_t \\in M_n(C(X))$ for $t \\in [0, 1]$ be a continuous path of projections connecting $p_0 = p$ and $p_1 = q$.\nThe map $t \\mapsto p_t$ is continuous from the compact interval $[0, 1]$ into the Banach algebra $M_n(C(X))$.\nSince $[0, 1]$ is compact, the map is uniformly continuous. Therefore, there exists a partition of the interval $0 = t_0 < t_1 < \\dots < t_k = 1$ such that for any $j \\in \\{0, \\dots, k-1\\}$:\n$$ \\|p_{t_{j+1}} - p_{t_j}\\| < 1 $$\nBy the Lemma proven in Section 2, the condition $\\|p_{t_{j+1}} - p_{t_j}\\| < 1$ implies that there exists a unitary equivalence between $p_{t_j}$ and $p_{t_{j+1}}$.\nConsequently, we have a chain of vector bundle isomorphisms:\n$$ E_{p_0} \\cong E_{p_{t_1}} \\cong E_{p_{t_2}} \\cong \\dots \\cong E_{p_{t_k}} = E_{p_1} $$\nSince vector bundle isomorphism is transitive, we conclude that $E_{p_0} \\cong E_{p_1}$.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nWe have shown that if $p$ and $q$ are homotopic projections, the associated vector bundles $E_p$ and $E_q$ are isomorphic. In the K-theory group $K^0(X)$, the class $[E]$ is defined by the isomorphism class of the bundle $E$. Therefore:\n$$ E_{p} \\cong E_{q} \\implies [E_p] = [E_q] \\text{ in } K^0(X) $$\nThis proves that the class $[E]$ is independent of the choice of the projection $p$ within its homotopy class.",

Topological Structure of $G/H$\n\nLet $G$ be a connected Lie group of dimension $n$, and let $H$ be a closed subgroup of $G$. Let $\\pi: G \\to G/H$ be the canonical projection map defined by $g \\mapsto gH$. We equip $G/H$ with the **quotient topology**, where a set $U \\subset G/H$ is open if and only if $\\pi^{-1}(U)$ is open in $G$.\n\n**Hausdorff Property:**\nThe quotient space $G/H$ is Hausdorff if and only if the set $R = \\{(g_1, g_2) \\in G \\times G \\mid g_1 H = g_2 H\\}$ is closed in $G \\times G$. Note that $R$ is the inverse image of the closed set $H$ under the continuous map $f: G \\times G \\to G$ defined by $f(g_1, g_2) = g_1^{-1} g_2$. Specifically, $g_1 H = g_2 H \\iff g_1^{-1} g_2 \\in H$. Since $H$ is a closed subgroup of $G$ and $f$ is continuous, $R = f^{-1}(H)$ is closed.

The projection $\\pi: G \\to G/H$ is an open map (a standard property of quotient maps by topological groups). The continuous open image of a second countable space is second countable. Thus, $G/H$ is second countable.\n\n### 2. Lie Algebraic Setup and the Slice Theorem\n\nBy the **Closed Subgroup Theorem** (Cartan's Theorem), every closed subgroup of a Lie group is an embedded Lie subgroup.

Construction of Smooth Charts\n\nWe construct a coordinate chart for $G/H$ near the identity coset $eH$.\n\nLet $V = V_{\\mathfrak{m}}$ be the neighborhood of $0$ in $\\mathfrak{m}$ found above. We define a map $\\psi: V \\to G/H$ by:\n$$ \\psi(X) = \\pi(\\exp(X)) = \\exp(X)H $$\n**Injectivity:**\nSuppose $\\psi(X_1) = \\psi(X_2)$ for $X_1, X_2 \\in V$. Then $\\exp(X_1)H = \\exp(X_2)H$, which implies $\\exp(X_1) = \\exp(X_2)h$ for some $h \\in H$.\nSince $\\exp(X_1), \\exp(X_2) \\in \\Phi(V \\times \\{e\\}) \\subset U$ and the decomposition in $U \\cong V \\times W_H$ is unique, we have:\n$$ \\Phi(X_1, e) = \\exp(X_1) = \\exp(X_2)h = \\Phi(X_2, h) $$\nDue to the injectivity of $\\Phi$ on $V \\times W_H$ (assuming we restrict $V$ sufficiently such that $\\exp(V)^{-1}\\exp(V) \\cap H \\subseteq W_H$), we must have $X_1 = X_2$ and $h = e$. Thus, $\\psi$ is injective.\n\n**Homeomorphism:**\nThe map $\\psi$ is a continuous bijection onto its image $\\pi(U)$. The image $\\pi(U)$ is open in $G/H$ because $U$ is open in $G$ and $\\pi$ is an open map. The inverse map $\\psi^{-1}: \\pi(U) \\to V$ is continuous because it corresponds to the projection of the smooth inverse $\\Phi^{-1}|_{\\exp(V)}$ onto the $\\mathfrak{m}$-component. Thus, $\\phi = \\psi^{-1}$ is a homeomorphism from the open set $\\mathcal{U}_e = \\pi(U) \\subset G/H$ to $V \\subset \\mathfrak{m} \\cong \\mathbb{R}^{n-k}$.\n\n**Atlas Construction:**\nThis creates a chart $(\\mathcal{U}_e, \\phi)$ around the identity coset. To cover $G/H$, we use left translations. For any $g \\in G$, the left translation map $L_g: G/H \\to G/H$ is a homeomorphism. We define charts around $gH$ by $(\\mathcal{U}_g, \\phi_g)$ where:\n$$ \\mathcal{U}_g = g \\cdot \\mathcal{U}_e = \\{g x H \\mid xH \\in \\mathcal{U}_e\\} $$\n$$ \\phi_g(yH) = \\phi(g^{-1} y H) $$\nThe collection $\\{(\\mathcal{U}_g, \\phi_g)\\}_{g \\in G}$ covers $G/H$ and forms an atlas.\n\n### 4. Smoothness of Transition Maps\n\nLet $(\\mathcal{U}_{g_1}, \\phi_{g_1})$ and $(\\mathcal{U}_{g_2}, \\phi_{g_2})$ be two overlapping charts. We must show that the transition map $\\phi_{g_2} \\circ \\phi_{g_1}^{-1}$ is smooth on its domain.\nThe domain is $\\phi_{g_1}(\\mathcal{U}_{g_1} \\cap \\mathcal{U}_{g_2}) \\subset V \\subset \\mathfrak{m}$.\nLet $X \\in \\text{domain}$. Then:\n$$ \\phi_{g_1}^{-1}(X) = g_1 \\exp(X) H $$\nApplying $\\phi_{g_2}$:\n$$ (\\phi_{g_2} \\circ \\phi_{g_1}^{-1})(X) = \\phi_{g_2}(g_1 \\exp(X) H) = \\phi(g_2^{-1} g_1 \\exp(X) H) $$\nLet $k(X) = g_2^{-1} g_1 \\exp(X)$. For $X$ in the domain, $k(X)H \\in \\mathcal{U}_e$, which means $k(X)$ can be decomposed uniquely in $U$ (possibly after adjusting domains) as:\n$$ k(X) = \\exp(X') h $$\nwhere $X' \\in V$ and $h \\in W_H$. By definition, $\\phi(k(X)H) = X'$.\nThe mapping $X \\mapsto X'$ is determined by the equation:\n$$ g_2^{-1} g_1 \\exp(X) = \\exp(X') h $$\nRecall the diffeomorphism $\\Phi^{-1}: U \\to V \\times W_H$. Let $\\text{pr}_{\\mathfrak{m}}: V \\times W_H \\to V$ be the smooth projection onto the first factor. Then:\n$$ X' = \\text{pr}_{\\mathfrak{m}}(\\Phi^{-1}(g_2^{-1} g_1 \\exp(X))) $$\nSince group multiplication, the exponential map, and $\\Phi^{-1}$ are all smooth, the composition yielding $X'$ is smooth with respect to $X$. Thus, the transition functions are smooth.\n\n### 5. Conclusion and Dimension\n\nWe have constructed a Hausdorff, second-countable topological space equipped with a smooth atlas. Therefore, $G/H$ is a smooth manifold.\n\nThe charts map open sets of $G/H$ to open sets of the vector space $\\mathfrak{m}$. Since $\\mathfrak{m}$ was chosen as a complement to $\\mathfrak{h}$ in $\\mathfrak{g}$, we have:\n$$ \\dim(G/H) = \\dim(\\mathfrak{m}) = \\dim(\\mathfrak{g}) - \\dim(\\mathfrak{h}) $$\nAlternatively, denoting dimensions as $\\dim(G)$ and $\\dim(H)$:\n\n**Answer:**\nThe quotient space $G/H$ is a smooth manifold.

Then $\\exp(X_1)H = \\exp(X_2)H$, which implies $\\exp(X_1) = \\exp(X_2)h$ for some $h \\in H$.\nSince $\\exp(X_1), \\exp(X_2) \\in \\Phi(V \\times \\{e\\}) \\subset U$ and the decomposition in $U \\cong V \\times W_H$ is unique, we have:\n$$ \\Phi(X_1, e) = \\exp(X_1) = \\exp(X_2)h = \\Phi(X_2, h) $$\nDue to the injectivity of $\\Phi$ on $V \\times W_H$ (assuming we restrict $V$ sufficiently such that $\\exp(V)^{-1}\\exp(V) \\cap H \\subseteq W_H$), we must have $X_1 = X_2$ and $h = e$. Thus, $\\psi$ is injective.\n\n**Homeomorphism:**\nThe map $\\psi$ is a continuous bijection onto its image $\\pi(U)$. The image $\\pi(U)$ is open in $G/H$ because $U$ is open in $G$ and $\\pi$ is an open map. The inverse map $\\psi^{-1}: \\pi(U) \\to V$ is continuous because it corresponds to the projection of the smooth inverse $\\Phi^{-1}|_{\\exp(V)}$ onto the $\\mathfrak{m}$-component. Thus, $\\phi = \\psi^{-1}$ is a homeomorphism from the open set $\\mathcal{U}_e = \\pi(U) \\subset G/H$ to $V \\subset \\mathfrak{m} \\cong \\mathbb{R}^{n-k}$.\n\n**Atlas Construction:**\nThis creates a chart $(\\mathcal{U}_e, \\phi)$ around the identity coset. To cover $G/H$, we use left translations. For any $g \\in G$, the left translation map $L_g: G/H \\to G/H$ is a homeomorphism. We define charts around $gH$ by $(\\mathcal{U}_g, \\phi_g)$ where:\n$$ \\mathcal{U}_g = g \\cdot \\mathcal{U}_e = \\{g x H \\mid xH \\in \\mathcal{U}_e\\} $$\n$$ \\phi_g(yH) = \\phi(g^{-1} y H) $$\nThe collection $\\{(\\mathcal{U}_g, \\phi_g)\\}_{g \\in G}$ covers $G/H$ and forms an atlas.\n\n### 4. Smoothness of Transition Maps\n\nLet $(\\mathcal{U}_{g_1}, \\phi_{g_1})$ and $(\\mathcal{U}_{g_2}, \\phi_{g_2})$ be two overlapping charts. We must show that the transition map $\\phi_{g_2} \\circ \\phi_{g_1}^{-1}$ is smooth on its domain.\nThe domain is $\\phi_{g_1}(\\mathcal{U}_{g_1} \\cap \\mathcal{U}_{g_2}) \\subset V \\subset \\mathfrak{m}$.\nLet $X \\in \\text{domain}$. Then:\n$$ \\phi_{g_1}^{-1}(X) = g_1 \\exp(X) H $$\nApplying $\\phi_{g_2}$:\n$$ (\\phi_{g_2} \\circ \\phi_{g_1}^{-1})(X) = \\phi_{g_2}(g_1 \\exp(X) H) = \\phi(g_2^{-1} g_1 \\exp(X) H) $$\nLet $k(X) = g_2^{-1} g_1 \\exp(X)$. For $X$ in the domain, $k(X)H \\in \\mathcal{U}_e$, which means $k(X)$ can be decomposed uniquely in $U$ (possibly after adjusting domains) as:\n$$ k(X) = \\exp(X') h $$\nwhere $X' \\in V$ and $h \\in W_H$. By definition, $\\phi(k(X)H) = X'$.\nThe mapping $X \\mapsto X'$ is determined by the equation:\n$$ g_2^{-1} g_1 \\exp(X) = \\exp(X') h $$\nRecall the diffeomorphism $\\Phi^{-1}: U \\to V \\times W_H$. Let $\\text{pr}_{\\mathfrak{m}}: V \\times W_H \\to V$ be the smooth projection onto the first factor. Then:\n$$ X' = \\text{pr}_{\\mathfrak{m}}(\\Phi^{-1}(g_2^{-1} g_1 \\exp(X))) $$\nSince group multiplication, the exponential map, and $\\Phi^{-1}$ are all smooth, the composition yielding $X'$ is smooth with respect to $X$. Thus, the transition functions are smooth.\n\n### 5. Conclusion and Dimension\n\nWe have constructed a Hausdorff, second-countable topological space equipped with a smooth atlas. Therefore, $G/H$ is a smooth manifold.\n\nThe charts map open sets of $G/H$ to open sets of the vector space $\\mathfrak{m}$. Since $\\mathfrak{m}$ was chosen as a complement to $\\mathfrak{h}$ in $\\mathfrak{g}$, we have:\n$$ \\dim(G/H) = \\dim(\\mathfrak{m}) = \\dim(\\mathfrak{g}) - \\dim(\\mathfrak{h}) $$\nAlternatively, denoting dimensions as $\\dim(G)$ and $\\dim(H)$:\n\n**Answer:**\nThe quotient space $G/H$ is a smooth manifold. Its dimension is given by:\n$$ \\dim(G/H) = \\dim(G) - \\dim(H) $$",

If a polynomial $a_n z^n + \\dots + a_0$ has integer coefficients, any rational root $p/q$ (in lowest terms) must satisfy:\n- $p$ is a factor of the constant term $a_0 = 2$.\n- $q$ is a factor of the leading coefficient $a_n = 1$.\n\nThe possible values for $p$ are $\\pm 1, \\pm 2$.\nThe possible values for $q$ are $\\pm 1$.\nThus, the possible rational roots are $\\pm 1$ and $\\pm 2$.\n\nWe test these values by substituting them into $f(z)$:\n\n1.  **Test $z = 1$:**\n    $$ f(1) = (1)^3 - 3(1) + 2 = 1 - 3 + 2 = 0 $$\n    Since $f(1) = 0$, **$z = 1$ is a root**. By the Factor Theorem, $(z - 1)$ is a factor of $f(z)$.\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Polynomial\nSince $(z - 1)$ is a factor, we can perform polynomial division to factor $f(z)$. We divide $z^3 - 3z + 2$ by $z - 1$.\n\nUsing synthetic division or polynomial long division:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & 1 & 0 & -3 & 2 \\\\\n  & \\downarrow & 1 & 1 & -2 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & 1 & 1 & -2 & 0\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThe quotient is $z^2 + z - 2$ and the remainder is $0$.\nThus, we can write:\n$$ f(z) = (z - 1)(z^2 + z - 2) $$\n\n### Step 3: Find Roots of the Quadratic Component\nNow we must find the roots of the quadratic factor $g(z) = z^2 + z - 2$. We set $g(z) = 0$:\n$$ z^2 + z - 2 = 0 $$\n\nWe can factor this quadratic expression by finding two numbers that multiply to $-2$ and add to $1$. These numbers are $+2$ and $-1$.

Separation of Variables\n\nWe assume a solution of the form:\n$$ u(x, y) = X(x)Y(y) $$\nwhere $X$ is a function of $x$ alone and $Y$ is a function of $y$ alone. Substituting this into the Laplace equation $u_{xx} + u_{yy} = 0$:\n\n$$ X''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y) = 0 $$\n\nAssuming $u(x, y)$ is not identically zero, we can divide by $X(x)Y(y)$ (where non-zero):\n\n$$ \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = 0 \\implies \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} $$\n\nSince the left side depends only on $x$ and the right side depends only on $y$, both must equal a constant, which we denote by $-\\lambda$:\n\n$$ \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda \\quad \\text{and} \\quad -\\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = -\\lambda $$\n\nThis gives us two ordinary differential equations:\n1. $X''(x) + \\lambda X(x) = 0$\n2. $Y''(y) - \\lambda Y(y) = 0$\n\n### 2. Determining the Separation Constant\n\nWe now consider the boundary condition $u(x, 0) = \\sin(x)$. In terms of our separated functions, this is:\n$$ X(x)Y(0) = \\sin(x) $$\n\nFor this equality to hold for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $X(x)$ must be proportional to $\\sin(x)$. We can set $X(x) = \\sin(x)$ and let the scaling constant be absorbed into $Y(y)$.\n\nSubstituting $X(x) = \\sin(x)$ into the first ODE:\n$$ X'(x) = \\cos(x) $$\n$$ X''(x) = -\\sin(x) $$\n$$ -\\sin(x) + \\lambda \\sin(x) = 0 \\implies (\\lambda - 1)\\sin(x) = 0 $$\n\nFor this to hold for all $x$, we must have:\n$$ \\lambda = 1 $$\n\n### 3.

Applying the Boundary Condition\n\nOur general separated solution is now:\n$$ u(x, y) = \\sin(x) (A e^y + B e^{-y}) $$\n\nApplying the boundary condition $u(x, 0) = \\sin(x)$:\n$$ u(x, 0) = \\sin(x) (A e^0 + B e^0) = \\sin(x) (A + B) $$\n\nTo satisfy $u(x, 0) = \\sin(x)$, we require:\n$$ A + B = 1 $$\n\nSince the problem asks to find *a* function, we can choose any pair of constants $A$ and $B$ that satisfy this condition. The simplest choices include:\n- Choosing $A=1, B=0$ yields $u(x, y) = e^y \\sin(x)$.\n- Choosing $A=0, B=1$ yields $u(x, y) = e^{-y} \\sin(x)$.\n- Choosing $A=1/2, B=1/2$ yields $u(x, y) = \\sin(x) \\cosh(y)$.\n\nWe select $A=1$ and $B=0$ for simplicity.\n\n### 5. Final Result and Verification\n\nThe proposed function is:\n$$ u(x, y) = e^y \\sin(x) $$\n\n**Verification:**\n1.  **Domain and Regularity:** The functions $e^y$ and $\\sin(x)$ are $C^\\infty$ on $\\mathbb{R}$, so their product is $C^\\infty$ (and thus $C^2$) on $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n2.  **Boundary Condition:**\n    $$ u(x, 0) = e^0 \\sin(x) = 1 \\cdot \\sin(x) = \\sin(x) $$\n    The condition is satisfied.\n3.  **Partial Differential Equation:**\n    Calculate partial derivatives:\n    $$ u_x = e^y \\cos(x) $$\n    $$ u_{xx} = -e^y \\sin(x) $$\n    $$ u_y = e^y \\sin(x) $$\n    $$ u_{yy} = e^y \\sin(x) $$\n    Sum them:\n    $$ u_{xx} + u_{yy} = -e^y \\sin(x) + e^y \\sin(x) = 0 $$\n    The Laplace equation is satisfied.\n\n**Note on Uniqueness:**\nThe Cauchy problem for the Laplace equation is ill-posed in the sense that the solution is not unique without specifying behavior at infinity (e.g., boundedness). Since Liouville's theorem implies there are no bounded harmonic functions on $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with non-constant boundary data, any solution must be unbounded. The function derived above is one valid member of the infinite set of solutions (which includes, for example, $u(x, y) = e^{-y}\\sin(x)$ and $u(x,y) = e^y\\sin(x) + Cy$).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nA function satisfying the conditions is:\n\n$$ u(x, y) = e^y \\sin(x) $$",

Substituting this into the Laplace equation $u_{xx} + u_{yy} = 0$:\n\n$$ X''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y) = 0 $$\n\nAssuming $u(x, y)$ is not identically zero, we can divide by $X(x)Y(y)$ (where non-zero):\n\n$$ \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = 0 \\implies \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} $$\n\nSince the left side depends only on $x$ and the right side depends only on $y$, both must equal a constant, which we denote by $-\\lambda$:\n\n$$ \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda \\quad \\text{and} \\quad -\\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = -\\lambda $$\n\nThis gives us two ordinary differential equations:\n1. $X''(x) + \\lambda X(x) = 0$\n2. $Y''(y) - \\lambda Y(y) = 0$\n\n### 2. Determining the Separation Constant\n\nWe now consider the boundary condition $u(x, 0) = \\sin(x)$. In terms of our separated functions, this is:\n$$ X(x)Y(0) = \\sin(x) $$\n\nFor this equality to hold for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $X(x)$ must be proportional to $\\sin(x)$. We can set $X(x) = \\sin(x)$ and let the scaling constant be absorbed into $Y(y)$.\n\nSubstituting $X(x) = \\sin(x)$ into the first ODE:\n$$ X'(x) = \\cos(x) $$\n$$ X''(x) = -\\sin(x) $$\n$$ -\\sin(x) + \\lambda \\sin(x) = 0 \\implies (\\lambda - 1)\\sin(x) = 0 $$\n\nFor this to hold for all $x$, we must have:\n$$ \\lambda = 1 $$\n\n### 3. Solving for $Y(y)$\n\nWith $\\lambda = 1$, the second ODE becomes:\n$$ Y''(y) - Y(y) = 0 $$\n\nThe general solution to this linear differential equation with constant coefficients is:\n$$ Y(y) = A e^y + B e^{-y} $$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are arbitrary constants.\n\n### 4. Applying the Boundary Condition\n\nOur general separated solution is now:\n$$ u(x, y) = \\sin(x) (A e^y + B e^{-y}) $$\n\nApplying the boundary condition $u(x, 0) = \\sin(x)$:\n$$ u(x, 0) = \\sin(x) (A e^0 + B e^0) = \\sin(x) (A + B) $$\n\nTo satisfy $u(x, 0) = \\sin(x)$, we require:\n$$ A + B = 1 $$\n\nSince the problem asks to find *a* function, we can choose any pair of constants $A$ and $B$ that satisfy this condition. The simplest choices include:\n- Choosing $A=1, B=0$ yields $u(x, y) = e^y \\sin(x)$.\n- Choosing $A=0, B=1$ yields $u(x, y) = e^{-y} \\sin(x)$.\n- Choosing $A=1/2, B=1/2$ yields $u(x, y) = \\sin(x) \\cosh(y)$.\n\nWe select $A=1$ and $B=0$ for simplicity.\n\n### 5. Final Result and Verification\n\nThe proposed function is:\n$$ u(x, y) = e^y \\sin(x) $$\n\n**Verification:**\n1.  **Domain and Regularity:** The functions $e^y$ and $\\sin(x)$ are $C^\\infty$ on $\\mathbb{R}$, so their product is $C^\\infty$ (and thus $C^2$) on $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n2.  **Boundary Condition:**\n    $$ u(x, 0) = e^0 \\sin(x) = 1 \\cdot \\sin(x) = \\sin(x) $$\n    The condition is satisfied.\n3.  **Partial Differential Equation:**\n    Calculate partial derivatives:\n    $$ u_x = e^y \\cos(x) $$\n    $$ u_{xx} = -e^y \\sin(x) $$\n    $$ u_y = e^y \\sin(x) $$\n    $$ u_{yy} = e^y \\sin(x) $$\n    Sum them:\n    $$ u_{xx} + u_{yy} = -e^y \\sin(x) + e^y \\sin(x) = 0 $$\n    The Laplace equation is satisfied.\n\n**Note on Uniqueness:**\nThe Cauchy problem for the Laplace equation is ill-posed in the sense that the solution is not unique without specifying behavior at infinity (e.g., boundedness). Since Liouville's theorem implies there are no bounded harmonic functions on $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with non-constant boundary data, any solution must be unbounded. The function derived above is one valid member of the infinite set of solutions (which includes, for example, $u(x, y) = e^{-y}\\sin(x)$ and $u(x,y) = e^y\\sin(x) + Cy$).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nA function satisfying the conditions is:\n\n$$ u(x, y) = e^y \\sin(x) $$",

Analysis of the Recurrence Relation\n\nThe recurrence relation relates $f(n+2)$ to $f(n)$. This \"step-2\" property implies that the values of $f$ on the even integers ($\\dots, -2, 0, 2, \\dots$) are determined independently of the values on the odd integers ($\\dots, -1, 1, 3, \\dots$). The set of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$ is partitioned into two disjoint sets based on parity (even and odd), and the recurrence operates within each set separately.\n\nWe can solve this problem by finding the general solution to the linear difference equation or by summation on the separate parity classes. We will use the method of particular and homogeneous solutions.\n\nThe equation is a linear non-homogeneous difference equation of the form:\n$$f(n+2) - f(n) = 2n + 3$$\n\n### 2. Particular Solution\n\nWe search for a particular solution $f_p(n)$ that satisfies the non-homogeneous equation. Since the non-homogeneous term $2n+3$ is a polynomial of degree 1, we try a polynomial of degree 2, $f_p(n) = An^2 + Bn$.\n\nSubstituting this into the recurrence:\n$$A(n+2)^2 + B(n+2) - (An^2 + Bn) = 2n + 3$$\n$$A(n^2 + 4n + 4) + (Bn + 2B) - An^2 - Bn = 2n + 3$$\n$$4An + (4A + 2B) = 2n + 3$$\n\nComparing coefficients of powers of $n$:\n1.  Coefficient of $n$: $4A = 2 \\implies A = \\frac{1}{2}$\n2.  Constant term: $4A + 2B = 3 \\implies 4(\\frac{1}{2}) + 2B = 3 \\implies 2 + 2B = 3 \\implies B = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nThus, a particular solution is:\n$$f_p(n) = \\frac{1}{2}n^2 + \\frac{1}{2}n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$\n\n### 3. Homogeneous Solution\n\nThe associated homogeneous equation is:\n$$f_h(n+2) - f_h(n) = 0 \\implies f_h(n+2) = f_h(n)$$\nThis implies that $f_h(n)$ is a periodic function with period 2. It depends only on the parity of $n$. We can express this as:\n$$f_h(n) = \\begin{cases} C_0 & \\text{if } n \\text{ is even} \\\\ C_1 & \\text{if } n \\text{ is odd} \\end{cases}$$\nwhere $C_0$ and $C_1$ are arbitrary constants.\n\n### 4. General Solution\n\nThe general solution is the sum of the particular and homogeneous solutions:\n$$f(n) = f_p(n) + f_h(n) = \\frac{n^2+n}{2} + \\begin{cases} C_0 & \\text{if } n \\text{ is even} \\\\ C_1 & \\text{if } n \\text{ is odd} \\end{cases}$$\n\n### 5. Applying Initial Conditions\n\nWe are given $f(0) = 1$. Since $0$ is even:\n$$f(0) = \\frac{0^2+0}{2} + C_0 = 1 \\implies C_0 = 1$$\n\nThus, for even integers $n$, the function is uniquely determined:\n$$f(n) = \\frac{n^2+n}{2} + 1 = \\frac{n^2+n+2}{2}$$\n\n**Missing Constraint for Odd Integers:**\nThe problem provides no value for $f(n)$ when $n$ is odd (e.g., $f(1)$). The recurrence relation never links an even input to an odd input. Therefore, $C_1$ remains an arbitrary integer constant. Let $C_1 = k$ where $k$ is an integer determining the value of $f(1)$. Specifically, $f(1) = 1 + k$.\n\n### 6. Well-Posedness Statement\n\nThe question asks for \"**the** explicit formula\", implying a unique solution. However, because the recurrence partitions the domain into two independent sets (evens and odds) and an initial condition is provided only for the even set, the solution is not unique.

        "raw_answer": "To find the explicit formula for the function $f: \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}$, we analyze the given functional equation:\n$$f(n+2) = f(n) + 2n + 3$$\nsubject to the initial condition $f(0) = 1$.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Recurrence Relation\n\nThe recurrence relation relates $f(n+2)$ to $f(n)$. This \"step-2\" property implies that the values of $f$ on the even integers ($\\dots, -2, 0, 2, \\dots$) are determined independently of the values on the odd integers ($\\dots, -1, 1, 3, \\dots$). The set of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$ is partitioned into two disjoint sets based on parity (even and odd), and the recurrence operates within each set separately.\n\nWe can solve this problem by finding the general solution to the linear difference equation or by summation on the separate parity classes. We will use the method of particular and homogeneous solutions.\n\nThe equation is a linear non-homogeneous difference equation of the form:\n$$f(n+2) - f(n) = 2n + 3$$\n\n### 2. Particular Solution\n\nWe search for a particular solution $f_p(n)$ that satisfies the non-homogeneous equation. Since the non-homogeneous term $2n+3$ is a polynomial of degree 1, we try a polynomial of degree 2, $f_p(n) = An^2 + Bn$.\n\nSubstituting this into the recurrence:\n$$A(n+2)^2 + B(n+2) - (An^2 + Bn) = 2n + 3$$\n$$A(n^2 + 4n + 4) + (Bn + 2B) - An^2 - Bn = 2n + 3$$\n$$4An + (4A + 2B) = 2n + 3$$\n\nComparing coefficients of powers of $n$:\n1.  Coefficient of $n$: $4A = 2 \\implies A = \\frac{1}{2}$\n2.  Constant term: $4A + 2B = 3 \\implies 4(\\frac{1}{2}) + 2B = 3 \\implies 2 + 2B = 3 \\implies B = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nThus, a particular solution is:\n$$f_p(n) = \\frac{1}{2}n^2 + \\frac{1}{2}n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$\n\n### 3. Homogeneous Solution\n\nThe associated homogeneous equation is:\n$$f_h(n+2) - f_h(n) = 0 \\implies f_h(n+2) = f_h(n)$$\nThis implies that $f_h(n)$ is a periodic function with period 2. It depends only on the parity of $n$. We can express this as:\n$$f_h(n) = \\begin{cases} C_0 & \\text{if } n \\text{ is even} \\\\ C_1 & \\text{if } n \\text{ is odd} \\end{cases}$$\nwhere $C_0$ and $C_1$ are arbitrary constants.\n\n### 4. General Solution\n\nThe general solution is the sum of the particular and homogeneous solutions:\n$$f(n) = f_p(n) + f_h(n) = \\frac{n^2+n}{2} + \\begin{cases} C_0 & \\text{if } n \\text{ is even} \\\\ C_1 & \\text{if } n \\text{ is odd} \\end{cases}$$\n\n### 5. Applying Initial Conditions\n\nWe are given $f(0) = 1$. Since $0$ is even:\n$$f(0) = \\frac{0^2+0}{2} + C_0 = 1 \\implies C_0 = 1$$\n\nThus, for even integers $n$, the function is uniquely determined:\n$$f(n) = \\frac{n^2+n}{2} + 1 = \\frac{n^2+n+2}{2}$$\n\n**Missing Constraint for Odd Integers:**\nThe problem provides no value for $f(n)$ when $n$ is odd (e.g., $f(1)$). The recurrence relation never links an even input to an odd input. Therefore, $C_1$ remains an arbitrary integer constant. Let $C_1 = k$ where $k$ is an integer determining the value of $f(1)$. Specifically, $f(1) = 1 + k$.\n\n### 6. Well-Posedness Statement\n\nThe question asks for \"**the** explicit formula\", implying a unique solution. However, because the recurrence partitions the domain into two independent sets (evens and odds) and an initial condition is provided only for the even set, the solution is not unique. The problem is **ill-posed** with respect to finding a unique function. There are infinitely many functions satisfying the conditions, parameterized by the choice of $f(1)$.\n\nWe provide the general explicit formula representing the family of all solutions.\n\n### Final Result\n\nThe values of $f(n)$ are given by:\n$$f(n) = \\frac{n^2 + n}{2} + \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } n \\text{ is even} \\\\ C & \\text{if } n \\text{ is odd} \\end{cases}$$\nwhere $C$ is an arbitrary integer constant. (If we define $C = f(1) - 1$, then $C$ is simply determined by the choice of $f(1)$).\n\nWe can write this as a single formula using the parity indicator:\n$$f(n) = \\frac{n^2+n+2}{2} + (C-1)(n \\bmod 2)$$\nOr alternatively using $(-1)^n$:\n$$f(n) = \\frac{n^2+n}{2} + \\frac{1+C}{2} + \\frac{1-C}{2}(-1)^n$$\n\nIf we assume the simplest case where $f(n)$ is a polynomial (which implies the periodic part must be constant, i.e., $C=1$), the unique solution would be $f(n) = \\frac{n^2+n+2}{2}$.

Separability of the Integral\n\nThe given function is $f(x, y) = e^{-(x^2 + y^2)}$. This can be factored as the product of two functions of a single variable:\n$$ f(x, y) = e^{-x^2} e^{-y^2}. $$\nThe kernel of the Fourier transform is also separable:\n$$ e^{-2\\pi i (x \\xi + y \\eta)} = e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} e^{-2\\pi i y \\eta}. $$\nThe integral is defined over $\\mathbb{R}^2$, and since $|f(x, y)| = e^{-(x^2+y^2)}$ is integrable on $\\mathbb{R}^2$ (it belongs to $L^1(\\mathbb{R}^2)$), we can apply Fubini's Theorem to write the double integral as a product of two single-variable integrals:\n\n$$ \\mathcal{F}\\{f\\}(\\xi, \\eta) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-x^2} e^{-y^2} e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} e^{-2\\pi i y \\eta} \\, dx \\, dy $$\n$$ \\mathcal{F}\\{f\\}(\\xi, \\eta) = \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-x^2} e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} \\, dx \\right) \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-y^2} e^{-2\\pi i y \\eta} \\, dy \\right). $$\n\nLet us define the one-dimensional Fourier transform of the Gaussian $g(t) = e^{-t^2}$ as:\n$$ I(k) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-t^2} e^{-2\\pi i t k} \\, dt. $$\nThen, our desired result is $\\mathcal{F}\\{f\\}(\\xi, \\eta) = I(\\xi) I(\\eta)$.\n\n### 2. Evaluation of the One-Dimensional Integral $I(k)$\n\nWe evaluate $I(k)$ by completing the square in the exponent of the integrand.

Since $e^{-z^2}$ is an entire function (holomorphic everywhere), by Cauchy's Integral Theorem, the contour integral is zero:\n$$ \\oint_C e^{-z^2} \\, dz = 0. $$\nThis breaks down into four segments:\n1.  From $-R$ to $R$ on the real axis: $\\int_{-R}^{R} e^{-x^2} \\, dx$.\n2.  Vertical segment at $R$: $\\int_{0}^{\\pi k} e^{-(R + iy)^2} i \\, dy$.\n3.

Vertical segment at $-R$: $\\int_{\\pi k}^{0} e^{-(-R + iy)^2} i \\, dy$.\n\nAs $R \\to \\infty$, the integrals over the vertical segments vanish. For the right vertical segment (where $z = R + iy$), the magnitude of the integrand is $|e^{-(R^2 - y^2 + 2iRy)}| = e^{-R^2 + y^2}$.

Substitution and Simplification\n\nNow, we substitute $(s+2)$ for every instance of $s$ in the expression for $G(s)$:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}\\{e^{-2t} \\sin(3t)\\}(s) = \\frac{3}{(s+2)^2 + 9} $$\n\nExpanding the denominator to simplify the expression:\n$$ (s+2)^2 + 9 = (s^2 + 4s + 4) + 9 = s^2 + 4s + 13 $$\n\nThus:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}\\{e^{-2t} \\sin(3t)\\}(s) = \\frac{3}{s^2 + 4s + 13} $$\n\n### 4. Verification of Convergence\n\nThe original transform $G(s) = \\frac{3}{s^2 + 9}$ is defined for $\\text{Re}(s) > 0$.\nApplying the shift $s \\to s+2$, the condition for convergence becomes:\n$$ \\text{Re}(s+2) > 0 \\implies \\text{Re}(s) + 2 > 0 \\implies \\text{Re}(s) > -2 $$\nThis matches the condition $\\text{Re}(s) > -2$ specified in the problem statement. The integral converges absolutely in this region because the exponential decay $e^{-2t}$ combined with $e^{-st}$ results in an integrand bounded by $e^{-(2+\\text{Re}(s))t}$, which decays to zero at infinity when $2+\\text{Re}(s) > 0$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Laplace transform of $f(t) = e^{-2t} \\sin(3t)$ is:\n\n$$ \\frac{3}{s^2 + 4s + 13} $$",

Proof for $n \\geq 6$\n\nWe prove that for any convex polygon with $n \\geq 6$ vertices labeled distinctively with $\\{1, \\ldots, n\\}$, there exists a diagonal with weight at least $k = \\lceil n/2 \\rceil$.\n\n**Proof by Contradiction:**\nAssume that for a given $n \\geq 6$, there exists a labeling such that every diagonal has weight strictly less than $k$.\nThis implies that any pair of vertices $\\{u, v\\}$ with weight $|L(u) - L(v)| \\geq k$ must be connected by an **edge** of the polygon. If they were connected by a diagonal, the diagonal would satisfy the condition we are trying to avoid.\n\nLet $S$ be the set of pairs of labels with difference at least $k$:\n$$ S = \\big\\{ \\{x, y\\} \\subseteq \\{1, \\ldots, n\\} : |x - y| \\geq k \\big\\} $$\nBy our assumption, every pair in $S$ must correspond to an edge of the polygon. In the graph of the polygon (which is a cycle $C_n$), the degree of every vertex is exactly 2. Therefore, if $S$ is a subset of the edges, the degree of any vertex in the graph defined by $S$ must be at most 2.\n\nConsider the vertex labeled $1$. We identify its neighbors in the set $S$.\nA label $y$ is connected to $1$ in $S$ if $|1 - y| \\geq k$, which simplifies to $y - 1 \\geq k$ (since $y > 1$).\nSo, $y \\geq k + 1$.\nThe possible values for $y$ are $\\{k+1, k+2, \\ldots, n\\}$.\nThe number of such neighbors (the degree of label 1 in $S$) is:\n$$ \\deg_S(1) = n - (k+1) + 1 = n - k $$\n\nFor $S$ to be a subset of the polygon's edges, we must have $\\deg_S(1) \\leq 2$. Thus, we require:\n$$ n - k \\leq 2 \\implies n - \\lceil n/2 \\rceil \\leq 2 $$\n\nLet's test this inequality for $n \\geq 6$:\n\n1.  **If $n$ is even**, let $n = 2m$ where $m \\geq 3$ (since $n \\geq 6$).\n    Then $k = \\lceil 2m/2 \\rceil = m$.\n    The condition becomes:\n    $$ 2m - m \\leq 2 \\implies m \\leq 2 $$\n    This contradicts $m \\geq 3$. Thus, for even $n \\geq 6$, the degree of label 1 in $S$ is at least 3, which is impossible for a polygon vertex.\n\n2.  **If $n$ is odd**, let $n = 2m + 1$ where $m \\geq 3$ (since $n \\geq 7$ for odd $n \\geq 6$).\n    Then $k = \\lceil (2m+1)/2 \\rceil = m + 1$.\n    The condition becomes:\n    $$ (2m + 1) - (m + 1) \\leq 2 \\implies m \\leq 2 $$\n    This contradicts $m \\geq 3$.

Comparison and Discussion\n\nTo determine which approximation is likely to be more accurate, we consider the error bounds for each method and the properties of the function $f(x) = e^{-x^2}$.\n\n**Theoretical Error Analysis:**\n1.  **Trapezoidal Rule Error ($E_T$):** The error term is given by $E_T = -\\frac{(b-a)^3}{12n^2} f''(\\xi)$ for some $\\xi \\in [a,b]$. The error is of order **$O(h^2)$**.\n2.  **Simpson's Rule Error ($E_S$):** The error term is given by $E_S = -\\frac{(b-a)^5}{180n^4} f^{(4)}(\\xi)$ for some $\\xi \\in [a,b]$. The error is of order **$O(h^4)$**.\n\nSince the step size $h = 0.25$ is less than 1, $h^4$ is significantly smaller than $h^2$ ($0.0039$ vs $0.0625$). Because $f(x) = e^{-x^2}$ is a smooth ($C^\\infty$) function on $[0,1]$, its derivatives are bounded, ensuring that the theoretical advantages of the higher-order method hold. Therefore, Simpson's Rule is expected to provide a much tighter approximation.\n\n**Verification against the True Value:**\nThe integral $I = \\int_0^1 e^{-x^2} dx$ relates to the error function, $\\text{erf}(x)$, specifically $I = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2} \\text{erf}(1)$.\nThe precise value is approximately **0.746824**.\n\nComparing our results:\n-   **Trapezoidal Error:** $|0.746824 - 0.742984| \\approx 0.00384$\n-   **Simpson's Error:** $|0.746824 - 0.746855| \\approx 0.000031$\n\n**Conclusion:**\n**Simpson's Rule** is more accurate.

Comparison and Discussion\n\nTo determine which approximation is likely to be more accurate, we consider the error bounds for each method and the properties of the function $f(x) = e^{-x^2}$.\n\n**Theoretical Error Analysis:**\n1.  **Trapezoidal Rule Error ($E_T$):** The error term is given by $E_T = -\\frac{(b-a)^3}{12n^2} f''(\\xi)$ for some $\\xi \\in [a,b]$. The error is of order **$O(h^2)$**.\n2.  **Simpson's Rule Error ($E_S$):** The error term is given by $E_S = -\\frac{(b-a)^5}{180n^4} f^{(4)}(\\xi)$ for some $\\xi \\in [a,b]$. The error is of order **$O(h^4)$**.\n\nSince the step size $h = 0.25$ is less than 1, $h^4$ is significantly smaller than $h^2$ ($0.0039$ vs $0.0625$). Because $f(x) = e^{-x^2}$ is a smooth ($C^\\infty$) function on $[0,1]$, its derivatives are bounded, ensuring that the theoretical advantages of the higher-order method hold. Therefore, Simpson's Rule is expected to provide a much tighter approximation.\n\n**Verification against the True Value:**\nThe integral $I = \\int_0^1 e^{-x^2} dx$ relates to the error function, $\\text{erf}(x)$, specifically $I = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2} \\text{erf}(1)$.\nThe precise value is approximately **0.746824**.\n\nComparing our results:\n-   **Trapezoidal Error:** $|0.746824 - 0.742984| \\approx 0.00384$\n-   **Simpson's Error:** $|0.746824 - 0.746855| \\approx 0.000031$\n\n**Conclusion:**\n**Simpson's Rule** is more accurate. This is because Simpson's Rule utilizes quadratic interpolation (parabolas) to approximate the function curve, whereas the Trapezoidal Rule uses linear interpolation (straight lines). For a smooth, curved function like $e^{-x^2}$, quadratic approximations capture the curvature much better, resulting in an error convergence rate of $O(h^4)$ compared to $O(h^2)$ for the Trapezoidal Rule.",

Algebraic and Topological Preliminaries\n\nLet $G$ be a Lie group and $H$ be a discrete normal subgroup of $G$.\n\n**Group Structure:**\nSince $H$ is a normal subgroup, the set of cosets $G/H$ forms a group under the operation $(g_1 H)(g_2 H) = (g_1 g_2)H$. Let $\\pi: G \\to G/H$ denote the canonical projection map $\\pi(g) = gH$.\n\n**Quotient Topology:**\nWe endow $G/H$ with the quotient topology relative to $\\pi$. A subset $U \\subset G/H$ is open if and only if $\\pi^{-1}(U)$ is open in $G$. Since $\\pi^{-1}(\\pi(V)) = \\bigcup_{h \\in H} Vh$ and right translation is a homeomorphism in $G$, the map $\\pi$ is an open map.\n\n**Hausdorff Property:**\nFor $G/H$ to be a manifold, it must be Hausdorff. A quotient group $G/H$ is Hausdorff if and only if $H$ is a closed subset of $G$.\n\n*Lemma:* A discrete subgroup of a Hausdorff topological group is closed.\n*Proof:* Let $G$ be a Hausdorff topological group and $H$ a discrete subgroup. Since $H$ is discrete, there exists an open neighborhood $U$ of the identity $e$ in $G$ such that $U \\cap H = \\{e\\}$. By the continuity of the map $(x, y) \\mapsto xy^{-1}$, there exists a neighborhood $V$ of $e$ such that $VV^{-1} \\subset U$.\nSuppose $x \\in \\bar{H}$ (the closure of $H$). The set $xV$ is a neighborhood of $x$, so it must contain an element $h \\in H$. Thus $x \\in hV^{-1}$, which implies $xV \\cap hV \\neq \\emptyset$.\nIf there is another element $h' \\in H \\cap xV$, then $h' \\in hV^{-1}V \\subset hU$. Thus $h^{-1}h' \\in U$. Since $h^{-1}h' \\in H$, we have $h^{-1}h' = e$, so $h = h'$.\nThus, $H \\cap xV = \\{h\\}$. Since $x$ is a limit point, every neighborhood of $x$ must contain points of $H$ distinct from $h$ (if $x=h$) or simply points of $H$ (if $x \\neq h$). However, we found a neighborhood containing only one point of $H$. This implies $x$ must be isolated in $H$. Since $x \\in \\bar{H}$ and $H$ is discrete, $x$ must be in $H$. Thus $H$ is closed.\n\nSince $G$ is a Lie group, it is Hausdorff. Therefore, $H$ is closed, and $G/H$ is a Hausdorff space. Furthermore, since $G$ is second-countable and $\\pi$ is open, $G/H$ is second-countable.\n\n### 2. Smooth Manifold Structure\n\nWe now construct a smooth atlas for $G/H$.\n\n**Local Injectivity of $\\pi$:**\nSince $H$ is discrete, there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $e$ in $G$ such that $U \\cap H = \\{e\\}$. By the continuity of $(x, y) \\mapsto x y^{-1}$ at $(e, e)$, there exists a connected open neighborhood $V$ of $e$ such that $V \\subset U$ and $V V^{-1} \\subset U$.\nRestricting the projection map to $V$, consider $\\pi|_V: V \\to \\pi(V) \\subset G/H$.\nIf $\\pi(v_1) = \\pi(v_2)$ for $v_1, v_2 \\in V$, then $v_1 v_2^{-1} \\in H$. Also, $v_1 v_2^{-1} \\in V V^{-1} \\subset U$. Since $U \\cap H = \\{e\\}$, we have $v_1 v_2^{-1} = e$, so $v_1 = v_2$.\nThus, $\\pi|_V$ is injective. Since $\\pi$ is continuous and open, $\\pi|_V$ is a homeomorphism from $V$ onto the open set $\\pi(V)$ in $G/H$.\n\n**Construction of Charts:**\nLet $n = \\dim(G)$. Since $G$ is a manifold, we can choose $V$ sufficiently small such that there exists a chart $\\phi: V \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$ of $G$.\nWe define a chart for $G/H$ around the identity element $\\bar{e} = \\pi(e)$ as $(\\pi(V), \\psi)$, where:\n$$ \\psi = \\phi \\circ (\\pi|_V)^{-1}: \\pi(V) \\to \\mathbb{R}^n $$\nThis maps the neighborhood $\\pi(V)$ of $\\bar{e}$ homeomorphically onto an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\nTo cover all of $G/H$, we use group translation. For any $g \\in G$, let $\\bar{g} = \\pi(g)$. The map $L_{\\bar{g}}: G/H \\to G/H$ defined by $x \\mapsto \\bar{g}x$ is a homeomorphism. We define charts around any point $\\bar{g}$ by translating the chart at the identity.\nLet $V_g = \\pi(gV)$. Define $\\psi_g: V_g \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$ by:\n$$ \\psi_g(y) = \\psi(L_{\\bar{g}^{-1}}(y)) = \\psi(\\bar{g}^{-1}y) $$\nThe collection $\\{(V_g, \\psi_g)\\}_{g \\in G}$ forms an atlas for $G/H$.\n\n**Smoothness of Transition Maps:**\nLet $(V_{g_1}, \\psi_{g_1})$ and $(V_{g_2}, \\psi_{g_2})$ be two charts with non-empty overlap. The transition map is essentially composed of translations and the original coordinate map $\\phi$.\nSince left multiplication in $G$ is smooth (it is a Lie group), and the local section $(\\pi|_V)^{-1}$ corresponds to the identity inclusion locally (or smooth translations thereof), the transition maps are compositions of smooth functions. Thus, $G/H$ is a smooth manifold.\n\n### 3. Smoothness of Group Operations\n\nWe must verify that multiplication $\\bar{\\mu}: G/H \\times G/H \\to G/H$ and inversion $\\bar{\\iota}: G/H \\to G/H$ are smooth maps.\n\nBy construction, the projection $\\pi: G \\to G/H$ is a local diffeomorphism. This means that for any $g \\in G$, there exists a neighborhood $W$ of $g$ such that $\\pi|_W$ is a diffeomorphism onto its image.\n\n**Multiplication:**\nConsider the diagram:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ccc}\nG \\times G & \\xrightarrow{\\mu} & G \\\\\n\\downarrow{\\pi \\times \\pi} & & \\downarrow{\\pi} \\\\\nG/H \\times G/H & \\xrightarrow{\\bar{\\mu}} & G/H\n\\end{array}\n$$\nWe have $\\bar{\\mu}(\\pi(x), \\pi(y)) = \\pi(xy)$.\nSince $\\pi$ is a surjective local diffeomorphism, smoothness can be checked locally by lifting. Locally, $\\bar{\\mu}$ corresponds to $\\pi \\circ \\mu \\circ (\\pi^{-1} \\times \\pi^{-1})$ (where $\\pi^{-1}$ denotes a local smooth section). Since $\\mu$ is smooth in $G$ and $\\pi$ is a local diffeomorphism, $\\bar{\\mu}$ is smooth.\n\n**Inversion:**\nSimilarly, $\\bar{\\iota}(\\pi(x)) = \\pi(x^{-1})$. Since the inversion map in $G$ is smooth, $\\bar{\\iota}$ is smooth on $G/H$.\n\nSince $G/H$ is a smooth manifold and the group operations are smooth, $G/H$ is a Lie group.\n\n### 4. Dimension\n\nWe determined the dimension during the construction of the charts.\nThe chart $\\psi: \\pi(V) \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$ was constructed via a homeomorphism with a chart domain $V \\subset G$. Thus, the dimension of the manifold $G/H$ is equal to the dimension of the manifold $G$.\n\n$$ \\dim(G/H) = \\dim(G) $$\n\nThis is consistent with the general formula $\\dim(G/H) = \\dim(G) - \\dim(H)$, where $\\dim(H) = 0$ because $H$ is discrete.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe have proven that the quotient group $G/H$ is a Lie group. Its dimension is:\n$$ \\dim(G/H) = \\dim(G) $$",

Applying the Initial Condition\n\nWe use the given initial condition $f(0) = 3$ to determine the constant $C$.\n\nSubstitute $x = 0$ and $f(0) = 3$ into the general solution:\n$$ 3 = C e^{2(0)} $$\n$$ 3 = C e^0 $$\n$$ 3 = C(1) $$\n$$ C = 3 $$\n\nSubstituting $C=3$ back into the general solution yields:\n$$ f(x) = 3e^{2x} $$\n\n### 5. Verification\n\nWe verify that $f(x) = 3e^{2x}$ satisfies both the differential equation and the initial condition.\n\n**1. Check the initial condition:**\n$$ f(0) = 3e^{2(0)} = 3e^0 = 3(1) = 3 $$\nThe initial condition holds.\n\n**2. Check the differential equation:**\nCalculate the derivative $f'(x)$:\n$$ f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( 3e^{2x} \\right) = 3 \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( e^{2x} \\right) = 3 \\cdot (2e^{2x}) = 6e^{2x} $$\nCalculate $2f(x)$:\n$$ 2f(x) = 2(3e^{2x}) = 6e^{2x} $$\nSince $f'(x) = 6e^{2x}$ and $2f(x) = 6e^{2x}$, we have $f'(x) = 2f(x)$.\nThe differential equation holds.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe explicit form of the function is:\n\n$$ f(x) = 3e^{2x} $$",

This suggests looking for a solution of the form:\n$$ u(x, y) = \\sin(x) Y(y) $$\nwhere $Y(y)$ is a function of $y$ to be determined.\n\n### 2. Substitution into the PDE\n\nLet us verify if a solution of this form is compatible with the Laplace equation. Compute the partial derivatives of $u(x, y) = \\sin(x) Y(y)$:\n\n$$ u_{xx} = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} [\\sin(x) Y(y)] = -\\sin(x) Y(y) $$\n$$ u_{yy} = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} [\\sin(x) Y(y)] = \\sin(x) Y''(y) $$\n\nSubstitute these into the PDE $u_{xx} + u_{yy} = 0$:\n$$ -\\sin(x) Y(y) + \\sin(x) Y''(y) = 0 $$\n\nFactor out $\\sin(x)$:\n$$ \\sin(x) [Y''(y) - Y(y)] = 0 $$\n\nFor this equation to hold for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ (specifically where $\\sin(x) \\neq 0$), the term in the brackets must be zero. This yields an ordinary differential equation (ODE) for $Y(y)$:\n$$ Y''(y) - Y(y) = 0 $$\n\n### 3. Solving the ODE for $Y(y)$\n\nThe general solution to the linear ODE $Y'' - Y = 0$ is given by linear combinations of exponentials or hyperbolic functions.

Now, we simplify the second term:\n\n$$ 2 \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(2k)^2} = 2 \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{4k^2} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{k^2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{k^2} $$\n\nRecognizing that $\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{k^2} = \\zeta(2)$, we have:\n\n$$ 2 \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(2k)^2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\zeta(2) $$\n\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $S$:\n\n$$ S = \\zeta(2) - \\frac{1}{2} \\zeta(2) = \\frac{1}{2} \\zeta(2) $$\n\nFinally, we substitute the known value $\\zeta(2) = \\frac{\\pi^2}{6}$:\n\n$$ S = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\pi^2}{6} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi^2}{12} $$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe series converges, and its sum is:\n$$ \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n^2} = \\frac{\\pi^2}{12} $$",

The Euler-Lagrange Equation\n\nLet the integrand be denoted by $F(x, y, y')$. In this problem:\n$$ F(x, y, y') = (y')^2 + 2xy $$\n\nA necessary condition for a function $y(x)$ to be an extremum of the functional $J[y]$ is that it must satisfy the Euler-Lagrange equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} - \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y'} \\right) = 0 $$\n\nWe compute the partial derivatives of $F$:\n1.  **Partial with respect to $y$:**\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left( (y')^2 + 2xy \\right) = 2x $$\n\n2.  **Partial with respect to $y'$:**\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y'} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y'} \\left( (y')^2 + 2xy \\right) = 2y' $$\n\nSubstituting these into the Euler-Lagrange equation gives:\n$$ 2x - \\frac{d}{dx} (2y') = 0 $$\n$$ 2x - 2y'' = 0 $$\n\nDividing by 2, we obtain the linear ordinary differential equation governing the extremum:\n$$ y''(x) = x $$\n\n### 2. Solving the Differential Equation\n\nWe solve the differential equation $y'' = x$ by integrating twice with respect to $x$.\n\n**First Integration:**\n$$ y'(x) = \\int x \\, dx = \\frac{x^2}{2} + C_1 $$\nwhere $C_1$ is an integration constant.\n\n**Second Integration:**\n$$ y(x) = \\int \\left( \\frac{x^2}{2} + C_1 \\right) \\, dx = \\frac{x^3}{6} + C_1 x + C_2 $$\nwhere $C_2$ is a second integration constant.\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n$$ y(x) = \\frac{x^3}{6} + C_1 x + C_2 $$\n\n### 3. Applying Boundary Conditions\n\nWe determine the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ using the given boundary conditions $y(0) = 0$ and $y(1) = 0$.\n\n1.  **Apply $y(0) = 0$:**\n    $$ y(0) = \\frac{0^3}{6} + C_1(0) + C_2 = 0 \\implies C_2 = 0 $$\n    So, the function simplifies to $y(x) = \\frac{x^3}{6} + C_1 x$.\n\n2.  **Apply $y(1) = 0$:**\n    $$ y(1) = \\frac{1^3}{6} + C_1(1) = \\frac{1}{6} + C_1 = 0 $$\n    Solving for $C_1$:\n    $$ C_1 = -\\frac{1}{6} $$\n\nSubstituting the constants back into the general solution, we obtain the candidate function:\n$$ y(x) = \\frac{x^3}{6} - \\frac{x}{6} = \\frac{1}{6}x(x^2 - 1) $$\n\n### 4. Verification of Minimization\n\nThe Euler-Lagrange equation provides a stationary point. To ensure this function minimizes $J[y]$, we examine the second variation or simply compare $J[y]$ with $J[y+\\eta]$ where $\\eta(x)$ is an admissible variation (i.e., $\\eta(x)$ is twice-differentiable and $\\eta(0)=\\eta(1)=0$).\n\nConsider $J[y + \\eta]$:\n$$ J[y + \\eta] = \\int_0^1 \\left( (y' + \\eta')^2 + 2x(y + \\eta) \\right) \\, dx $$\nExpanding the term $(y' + \\eta')^2$:\n$$ J[y + \\eta] = \\int_0^1 \\left( (y')^2 + 2y'\\eta' + (\\eta')^2 + 2xy + 2x\\eta \\right) \\, dx $$\nGrouping terms:\n$$ J[y + \\eta] = \\underbrace{\\int_0^1 \\left( (y')^2 + 2xy \\right) \\, dx}_{J[y]} + \\underbrace{\\int_0^1 \\left( 2y'\\eta' + 2x\\eta \\right) \\, dx}_{\\delta J} + \\int_0^1 (\\eta')^2 \\, dx $$\n\nThe first variation term is $\\delta J = \\int_0^1 (2y'\\eta' + 2x\\eta) \\, dx$. Integrating $2y'\\eta'$ by parts:\n$$ \\int_0^1 2y'\\eta' \\, dx = [2y'\\eta]_0^1 - \\int_0^1 2y''\\eta \\, dx $$\nSince $\\eta(0)=\\eta(1)=0$, the boundary term vanishes. Thus:\n$$ \\delta J = \\int_0^1 (-2y'' + 2x)\\eta \\, dx = 2 \\int_0^1 (x - y'')\\eta \\, dx $$\nSince $y$ satisfies $y'' = x$, $\\delta J = 0$.\n\nThis leaves:\n$$ J[y + \\eta] = J[y] + \\int_0^1 (\\eta'(x))^2 \\, dx $$\nSince $(\\eta'(x))^2 \\ge 0$ for all real $x$, the integral $\\int_0^1 (\\eta')^2 \\, dx \\ge 0$. It is zero only if $\\eta'(x) = 0$ for all $x$, which implies $\\eta(x)$ is constant. Given $\\eta(0)=0$, this implies $\\eta(x) \\equiv 0$.\n\nTherefore, $J[y + \\eta] > J[y]$ for any non-zero perturbation $\\eta$, proving that $y(x)$ is the strict global minimizer.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe function $y(x)$ that minimizes the functional is:\n$$ y(x) = \\frac{x^3 - x}{6} $$",

In this problem:\n$$ F(x, y, y') = (y')^2 + 2xy $$\n\nA necessary condition for a function $y(x)$ to be an extremum of the functional $J[y]$ is that it must satisfy the Euler-Lagrange equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} - \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y'} \\right) = 0 $$\n\nWe compute the partial derivatives of $F$:\n1.  **Partial with respect to $y$:**\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left( (y')^2 + 2xy \\right) = 2x $$\n\n2.  **Partial with respect to $y'$:**\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y'} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y'} \\left( (y')^2 + 2xy \\right) = 2y' $$\n\nSubstituting these into the Euler-Lagrange equation gives:\n$$ 2x - \\frac{d}{dx} (2y') = 0 $$\n$$ 2x - 2y'' = 0 $$\n\nDividing by 2, we obtain the linear ordinary differential equation governing the extremum:\n$$ y''(x) = x $$\n\n### 2. Solving the Differential Equation\n\nWe solve the differential equation $y'' = x$ by integrating twice with respect to $x$.\n\n**First Integration:**\n$$ y'(x) = \\int x \\, dx = \\frac{x^2}{2} + C_1 $$\nwhere $C_1$ is an integration constant.\n\n**Second Integration:**\n$$ y(x) = \\int \\left( \\frac{x^2}{2} + C_1 \\right) \\, dx = \\frac{x^3}{6} + C_1 x + C_2 $$\nwhere $C_2$ is a second integration constant.\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n$$ y(x) = \\frac{x^3}{6} + C_1 x + C_2 $$\n\n### 3. Applying Boundary Conditions\n\nWe determine the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ using the given boundary conditions $y(0) = 0$ and $y(1) = 0$.\n\n1.  **Apply $y(0) = 0$:**\n    $$ y(0) = \\frac{0^3}{6} + C_1(0) + C_2 = 0 \\implies C_2 = 0 $$\n    So, the function simplifies to $y(x) = \\frac{x^3}{6} + C_1 x$.\n\n2.  **Apply $y(1) = 0$:**\n    $$ y(1) = \\frac{1^3}{6} + C_1(1) = \\frac{1}{6} + C_1 = 0 $$\n    Solving for $C_1$:\n    $$ C_1 = -\\frac{1}{6} $$\n\nSubstituting the constants back into the general solution, we obtain the candidate function:\n$$ y(x) = \\frac{x^3}{6} - \\frac{x}{6} = \\frac{1}{6}x(x^2 - 1) $$\n\n### 4. Verification of Minimization\n\nThe Euler-Lagrange equation provides a stationary point. To ensure this function minimizes $J[y]$, we examine the second variation or simply compare $J[y]$ with $J[y+\\eta]$ where $\\eta(x)$ is an admissible variation (i.e., $\\eta(x)$ is twice-differentiable and $\\eta(0)=\\eta(1)=0$).\n\nConsider $J[y + \\eta]$:\n$$ J[y + \\eta] = \\int_0^1 \\left( (y' + \\eta')^2 + 2x(y + \\eta) \\right) \\, dx $$\nExpanding the term $(y' + \\eta')^2$:\n$$ J[y + \\eta] = \\int_0^1 \\left( (y')^2 + 2y'\\eta' + (\\eta')^2 + 2xy + 2x\\eta \\right) \\, dx $$\nGrouping terms:\n$$ J[y + \\eta] = \\underbrace{\\int_0^1 \\left( (y')^2 + 2xy \\right) \\, dx}_{J[y]} + \\underbrace{\\int_0^1 \\left( 2y'\\eta' + 2x\\eta \\right) \\, dx}_{\\delta J} + \\int_0^1 (\\eta')^2 \\, dx $$\n\nThe first variation term is $\\delta J = \\int_0^1 (2y'\\eta' + 2x\\eta) \\, dx$. Integrating $2y'\\eta'$ by parts:\n$$ \\int_0^1 2y'\\eta' \\, dx = [2y'\\eta]_0^1 - \\int_0^1 2y''\\eta \\, dx $$\nSince $\\eta(0)=\\eta(1)=0$, the boundary term vanishes. Thus:\n$$ \\delta J = \\int_0^1 (-2y'' + 2x)\\eta \\, dx = 2 \\int_0^1 (x - y'')\\eta \\, dx $$\nSince $y$ satisfies $y'' = x$, $\\delta J = 0$.\n\nThis leaves:\n$$ J[y + \\eta] = J[y] + \\int_0^1 (\\eta'(x))^2 \\, dx $$\nSince $(\\eta'(x))^2 \\ge 0$ for all real $x$, the integral $\\int_0^1 (\\eta')^2 \\, dx \\ge 0$. It is zero only if $\\eta'(x) = 0$ for all $x$, which implies $\\eta(x)$ is constant. Given $\\eta(0)=0$, this implies $\\eta(x) \\equiv 0$.\n\nTherefore, $J[y + \\eta] > J[y]$ for any non-zero perturbation $\\eta$, proving that $y(x)$ is the strict global minimizer.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe function $y(x)$ that minimizes the functional is:\n$$ y(x) = \\frac{x^3 - x}{6} $$",

This approach constructs a sequence of trigonometric polynomials derived from the Fourier coefficients of $f$ that converges to $f$ in the $L^1$ norm.\n\n### 1. Construction of Partial Sums and Ces\u00e0ro Means\n\nLet the $N$-th partial sum of the Fourier series of $f$ be denoted by $S_N(f)$. For any $x \\in G$:\n$$ S_N(f)(x) = \\sum_{n=-N}^{N} \\widehat{f}(n) e^{2\\pi i n x} $$\nBy the hypothesis, $\\widehat{f}(n) = 0$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Substituting this into the definition:\n$$ S_N(f)(x) = \\sum_{n=-N}^{N} 0 \\cdot e^{2\\pi i n x} = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } x \\in G, \\, N \\ge 0 $$\n\nNext, we consider the Ces\u00e0ro means (or Fej\u00e9r means) of the Fourier series, denoted by $\\sigma_N(f)$. These are defined as the arithmetic mean of the first $N+1$ partial sums:\n$$ \\sigma_N(f)(x) = \\frac{1}{N+1} \\sum_{k=0}^{N} S_k(f)(x) $$\nSince $S_k(f)(x) = 0$ for all $k$, it follows immediately that:\n$$ \\sigma_N(f)(x) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } x \\in G, \\, N \\ge 0 $$\n\n### 2. Integral Representation via the Fej\u00e9r Kernel\n\nIt is a standard result in harmonic analysis that the Ces\u00e0ro means can be expressed as the convolution of the function $f$ with the Fej\u00e9r kernel $K_N$. The Fej\u00e9r kernel is defined as:\n$$ K_N(x) = \\sum_{n=-N}^{N} \\left(1 - \\frac{|n|}{N+1}\\right) e^{2\\pi i n x} $$\nThe convolution identity states:\n$$ \\sigma_N(f)(x) = (f * K_N)(x) = \\int_0^1 f(x-t) K_N(t) \\, dt $$\nFrom our previous step, we know $\\sigma_N(f)(x) = 0$ for all $x$. Therefore, $f * K_N = 0$ as an element of $L^1(G)$.\n\n### 3. Convergence of Fej\u00e9r Means in $L^1$\n\nWe now establish that $\\sigma_N(f)$ converges to $f$ in the $L^1$ norm.

Construction of Partial Sums and Ces\u00e0ro Means\n\nLet the $N$-th partial sum of the Fourier series of $f$ be denoted by $S_N(f)$.

The length of this interval is:\n$$ x_i - x_{i-1} = \\frac{i}{n} - \\frac{i-1}{n} = \\frac{1}{n} $$\nSince $\\frac{1}{n} < \\delta$, we have $|x_i - x_{i-1}| < \\delta$.\n\nBy the fundamental theorem of calculus for Lebesgue integrals (specifically, that $F(b) - F(a) = \\int_a^b f(t) \\, dt$), the integral over this subinterval is:\n$$ \\int_{x_{i-1}}^{x_i} f(x) \\, dx = \\int_0^{x_i} f(x) \\, dx - \\int_0^{x_{i-1}} f(x) \\, dx = F(x_i) - F(x_{i-1}) $$\n\nApplying the uniform continuity property from Step 1:\n$$ \\left| \\int_{x_{i-1}}^{x_i} f(x) \\, dx \\right| = |F(x_i) - F(x_{i-1})| < \\epsilon $$\n\nThis inequality holds for every subinterval $[x_{i-1}, x_i]$ in the partition.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe have explicitly constructed a partition (specifically, a uniform partition with mesh size less than $\\delta$) such that the absolute value of the integral of $f$ over every subinterval is strictly less than $\\epsilon$.\n\n**Remark on the Hypothesis $\\int_0^1 f = 0$:**\nWhile the proof above relies on the continuity of the indefinite integral and holds for *any* Lebesgue integrable function regardless of its total integral, the specific hypothesis $\\int_0^1 f(x) \\, dx = 0$ allows for an even simpler existence proof.

Because $[0, 1]$ is a compact set, the Heine-Cantor theorem states that $F$ is uniformly continuous on $[0, 1]$.\n\nThe definition of uniform continuity implies that for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\\delta > 0$ such that for all $x, y \\in [0, 1]$:\n$$ |x - y| < \\delta \\implies |F(x) - F(y)| < \\epsilon $$\n\n**Step 2: Constructing the Partition**\nLet $\\epsilon > 0$ be given. Let $\\delta > 0$ be the value guaranteed by the uniform continuity of $F$ corresponding to this $\\epsilon$.\n\nWe can choose an integer $n$ sufficiently large such that the subinterval length is less than $\\delta$. Specifically, choose $n$ such that:\n$$ \\frac{1}{n} < \\delta $$\n\nDefine the uniform partition $P = \\{x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_n\\}$ where:\n$$ x_i = \\frac{i}{n} \\quad \\text{for } i = 0, 1, \\dots, n $$\nClearly, $0 = x_0 < x_1 < \\dots < x_n = 1$, so this is a valid partition of $[0, 1]$.\n\n**Step 3: Verifying the Condition**\nConsider an arbitrary subinterval $[x_{i-1}, x_i]$ defined by this partition. The length of this interval is:\n$$ x_i - x_{i-1} = \\frac{i}{n} - \\frac{i-1}{n} = \\frac{1}{n} $$\nSince $\\frac{1}{n} < \\delta$, we have $|x_i - x_{i-1}| < \\delta$.\n\nBy the fundamental theorem of calculus for Lebesgue integrals (specifically, that $F(b) - F(a) = \\int_a^b f(t) \\, dt$), the integral over this subinterval is:\n$$ \\int_{x_{i-1}}^{x_i} f(x) \\, dx = \\int_0^{x_i} f(x) \\, dx - \\int_0^{x_{i-1}} f(x) \\, dx = F(x_i) - F(x_{i-1}) $$\n\nApplying the uniform continuity property from Step 1:\n$$ \\left| \\int_{x_{i-1}}^{x_i} f(x) \\, dx \\right| = |F(x_i) - F(x_{i-1})| < \\epsilon $$\n\nThis inequality holds for every subinterval $[x_{i-1}, x_i]$ in the partition.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe have explicitly constructed a partition (specifically, a uniform partition with mesh size less than $\\delta$) such that the absolute value of the integral of $f$ over every subinterval is strictly less than $\\epsilon$.\n\n**Remark on the Hypothesis $\\int_0^1 f = 0$:**\nWhile the proof above relies on the continuity of the indefinite integral and holds for *any* Lebesgue integrable function regardless of its total integral, the specific hypothesis $\\int_0^1 f(x) \\, dx = 0$ allows for an even simpler existence proof. The trivial partition $P = \\{0, 1\\}$ (where $x_0=0, x_1=1$) yields a single subinterval $[0, 1]$. The integral over this subinterval is $\\int_0^1 f(x) \\, dx = 0$. Since $\\epsilon > 0$, we have $|0| < \\epsilon$, satisfying the condition immediately.\n\nHowever, the construction using uniform continuity demonstrates that partitions with arbitrarily small sub-integrals exist, which is a more general and structurally significant result in analysis.\n\n**Final Result:**\nFor any $\\epsilon > 0$, such a partition exists.",
