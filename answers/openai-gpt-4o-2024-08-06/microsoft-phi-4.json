Thus, \\( 0 \\in IJ \\).\n\n**Existence of additive inverses:**\n\nFor any \\( x = \\sum_{k=1}^{m} a_k b_k \\in IJ \\), the additive inverse is:\n\n\\[\n-x = \\sum_{k=1}^{m} (-a_k) b_k\n\\]\n\nSince \\( I \\) is an ideal, \\( -a_k \\in I \\) for each \\( k \\).

Understanding the Setup:**\n\n- A projection $p \\in M_n(C(X, \\mathbb{C}))$ is a matrix-valued function such that $p^2 = p$ and $p^* = p$. This means $p$ is a self-adjoint idempotent matrix.\n- The vector bundle $E_p \\to X$ associated with $p$ is constructed by considering the image of $p$ as a subbundle of the trivial bundle $X \\times \\mathbb{C}^n$.\n\n**2. Homotopy of Projections:**\n\n- A continuous family of projections $p_t$ with $p_0 = p$ and $p_1 = q$ implies that for each $t \\in [0, 1]$, $p_t$ is a projection, i.e., $p_t^2 = p_t$ and $p_t^* = p_t$.\n- The homotopy $p_t$ provides a continuous deformation from $p$ to $q$.\n\n**3. Constructing a Homotopy of Vector Bundles:**\n\n- The homotopy $p_t$ induces a continuous family of vector bundles $E_{p_t} \\to X$.\n- For each $t$, $E_{p_t}$ is the subbundle of $X \\times \\mathbb{C}^n$ corresponding to the image of $p_t$.\n\n**4. Isomorphism of Vector Bundles:**\n\n- The key idea is that a continuous deformation of projections induces an isomorphism of the associated vector bundles in $K$-theory.\n- Specifically, the map $t \\mapsto p_t$ provides a continuous path in the space of projections, and this path induces a continuous path of vector bundles $E_{p_t}$.\n\n**5. Homotopy Invariance in $K$-theory:**\n\n- In $K$-theory, vector bundles that are homotopic are considered equivalent. This is because $K^0(X)$ is defined as the Grothendieck group of isomorphism classes of vector bundles, and homotopy provides a natural equivalence relation.\n- Since $p_t$ is a continuous path from $p$ to $q$, the vector bundles $E_p$ and $E_q$ are homotopic, and thus they represent the same class in $K^0(X)$.\n\n**6. Conclusion:**\n\n- Therefore, the class $[E_p]$ in $K^0(X)$ is independent of the choice of the projection $p$ within its homotopy class.

Thus, the class $[E]$ in $K^0(X)$ depends only on the homotopy class of the projection $p$.",
        "raw_answer": "To prove that the class $[E]$ in $K^0(X)$ is independent of the choice of the projection $p$ within its homotopy class, we need to show that if $p_t \\in M_n(C(X, \\mathbb{C}))$ is a continuous family of projections with $p_0 = p$ and $p_1 = q$, then the associated vector bundles $E_p$ and $E_q$ are isomorphic in the sense of $K$-theory, i.e., $[E_p] = [E_q]$ in $K^0(X)$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Proof\n\n**1. Understanding the Setup:**\n\n- A projection $p \\in M_n(C(X, \\mathbb{C}))$ is a matrix-valued function such that $p^2 = p$ and $p^* = p$. This means $p$ is a self-adjoint idempotent matrix.\n- The vector bundle $E_p \\to X$ associated with $p$ is constructed by considering the image of $p$ as a subbundle of the trivial bundle $X \\times \\mathbb{C}^n$.\n\n**2. Homotopy of Projections:**\n\n- A continuous family of projections $p_t$ with $p_0 = p$ and $p_1 = q$ implies that for each $t \\in [0, 1]$, $p_t$ is a projection, i.e., $p_t^2 = p_t$ and $p_t^* = p_t$.\n- The homotopy $p_t$ provides a continuous deformation from $p$ to $q$.\n\n**3. Constructing a Homotopy of Vector Bundles:**\n\n- The homotopy $p_t$ induces a continuous family of vector bundles $E_{p_t} \\to X$.\n- For each $t$, $E_{p_t}$ is the subbundle of $X \\times \\mathbb{C}^n$ corresponding to the image of $p_t$.\n\n**4. Isomorphism of Vector Bundles:**\n\n- The key idea is that a continuous deformation of projections induces an isomorphism of the associated vector bundles in $K$-theory.\n- Specifically, the map $t \\mapsto p_t$ provides a continuous path in the space of projections, and this path induces a continuous path of vector bundles $E_{p_t}$.\n\n**5. Homotopy Invariance in $K$-theory:**\n\n- In $K$-theory, vector bundles that are homotopic are considered equivalent. This is because $K^0(X)$ is defined as the Grothendieck group of isomorphism classes of vector bundles, and homotopy provides a natural equivalence relation.\n- Since $p_t$ is a continuous path from $p$ to $q$, the vector bundles $E_p$ and $E_q$ are homotopic, and thus they represent the same class in $K^0(X)$.\n\n**6. Conclusion:**\n\n- Therefore, the class $[E_p]$ in $K^0(X)$ is independent of the choice of the projection $p$ within its homotopy class. Specifically, $[E_p] = [E_q]$ in $K^0(X)$.\n\nThis completes the proof that the class of the vector bundle associated with a projection is invariant under homotopy of projections in $M_n(C(X, \\mathbb{C}))$. Thus, the class $[E]$ in $K^0(X)$ depends only on the homotopy class of the projection $p$.",

Clearly, $a_{\\max} = n$ and $a_{\\min} = 1$.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the Distribution of Labels\n\n- Since the labels are distinct integers from $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}$, the difference $a_{\\max} - a_{\\min} = n - 1$.\n\n#### Step 3: Consider the Arrangement of Labels\n\n- The labels are arranged around the polygon. Consider the sequence of labels as they appear around the polygon: $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$.\n\n#### Step 4: Identify a Large Weight Diagonal\n\n- We need to find two non-adjacent vertices $v_i$ and $v_j$ such that $|a_i - a_j| \\geq \\left\\lceil \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rceil$.\n\n- Consider the sequence of labels modulo $n$. Since the labels are distinct, they form a permutation of $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}$.\n\n- By the pigeonhole principle, if we consider any $n$ consecutive labels in this sequence, there must be at least one pair of labels whose difference is at least $\\left\\lceil \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rceil$.\n\n#### Step 5: Construct the Diagonal\n\n- Without loss of generality, assume the labels are arranged such that $a_1 = 1$ and $a_k = n$ for some $k$.\n\n- Consider the sequence of labels from $a_1$ to $a_k$ and from $a_k$ to $a_1$ (completing the cycle).\n\n- In either sequence, there must be a pair of labels whose difference is at least $\\left\\lceil \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rceil$.\n\n- Since the polygon is convex, any two non-adjacent vertices can be connected by a diagonal. Thus, there exists a diagonal connecting two vertices with labels differing by at least $\\left\\lceil \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rceil$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThus, we have shown that there exists a diagonal in the polygon whose weight is at least $\\left\\lceil \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rceil$.

This allows us to use the slice theorem for Lie group actions, which states that there exists a $G$-invariant neighborhood $U$ of the identity in $G$ such that $U$ is diffeomorphic to $H \\times V$ for some open set $V \\subset G$. The quotient $U/H$ is diffeomorphic to $V$, which is an open subset of $G$.\n\n- **Covering by Diffeomorphic Charts:** The local trivialization implies that $G/H$ can be covered by charts that are diffeomorphic to open subsets of $G$. Specifically, for each $g \\in G$, there exists a neighborhood $U_g$ such that $\\pi|_{U_g}: U_g \\to \\pi(U_g)$ is a diffeomorphism onto its image.

This is well-defined because $H$ is normal in $G$.\n\n- **Inversion:** Define the inversion by $(gH)^{-1} = (g^{-1})H$.\n\n- **Smoothness:** The smoothness of these operations follows from the smoothness of the corresponding operations in $G$ and the fact that the projection map $\\pi$ is a local diffeomorphism.\n\n### Step 4: Dimension of $G/H$\n\n- **Dimension Calculation:** The dimension of a quotient manifold $G/H$ is given by the dimension of $G$ minus the dimension of $H$.

Specifically, for each \\( g \\in G \\), there exists a neighborhood \\( U_g \\) such that \\( \\pi|_{U_g}: U_g \\to \\pi(U_g) \\) is a diffeomorphism onto its image. These charts provide a smooth manifold structure on \\( G/H \\).\n\n### Step 3: Group Operations on \\( G/H \\)\n\n- **Multiplication:** Define the multiplication on \\( G/H \\) by \\((gH)(kH) = (gk)H\\). This is well-defined because \\( H \\) is normal in \\( G \\).\n\n- **Inversion:** Define the inversion by \\((gH)^{-1} = (g^{-1})H\\).\n\n- **Smoothness:** The smoothness of these operations follows from the smoothness of the corresponding operations in \\( G \\) and the fact that the projection map \\(\\pi\\) is a local diffeomorphism.\n\n### Step 4: Dimension of \\( G/H \\)\n\n- **Dimension Calculation:** The dimension of a quotient manifold \\( G/H \\) is given by the dimension of \\( G \\) minus the dimension of \\( H \\). Since \\( H \\) is discrete, it has dimension 0. Therefore, the dimension of \\( G/H \\) is:\n  \\[\n  \\dim(G/H) = \\dim(G) - \\dim(H) = \\dim(G) - 0 = \\dim(G).\n  \\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe quotient group \\( G/H \\) is a Lie group with the same dimension as \\( G \\). The smooth manifold structure and group operations on \\( G/H \\) are inherited from \\( G \\) through the local trivialization and the properties of the discrete subgroup \\( H \\).\n\nThus, we have shown that \\( G/H \\) is a Lie group and determined its dimension:\n\\[\n\\dim(G/H) = \\dim(G).\n\\]",

Let's denote this subgroup by $P$.

However, \\( n_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2} \\) restricts \\( n_2 \\) to be 1 or 7.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the implications\n\nSince \\( n_7 = 1 \\), there is exactly one Sylow 7-subgroup in \\( G \\). Let's denote this subgroup by \\( P \\). By Sylow's theorems, if there is exactly one Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroup, it must be normal in \\( G \\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe subgroup \\( P \\) of order 7 is the unique Sylow 7-subgroup of \\( G \\) and is therefore normal in \\( G \\).\n\nThus, \\( G \\) has a normal subgroup of order 7.\n\n**Final Answer:** \\( G \\) has a normal subgroup of order 7.",

Therefore, the Fourier series becomes:\n   $$\n   S_N(f)(x) = \\sum_{n=-N}^{N} 0 \\cdot e^{2\\pi i n x} = 0\n   $$\n   for all $N$.\n\n3. **Pointwise Convergence:**\n   The Fourier series $S_N(f)(x)$ converges pointwise to $f(x)$ almost everywhere on $G$ because $f \\in L^1(G)$. This is a consequence of the Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma and the properties of $L^1$ functions.\n\n4. **Conclusion from Zero Fourier Coefficients:**\n   Since $S_N(f)(x) = 0$ for all $N$, it follows that the pointwise limit of $S_N(f)(x)$ is also zero almost everywhere.

This is a consequence of the Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma and the properties of \\( L^1 \\) functions.\n\n4. **Conclusion from Zero Fourier Coefficients:**\n   Since \\( S_N(f)(x) = 0 \\) for all \\( N \\), it follows that the pointwise limit of \\( S_N(f)(x) \\) is also zero almost everywhere. Therefore, \\( f(x) = 0 \\) almost everywhere on \\( G \\).\n\n5. **Uniqueness of the Limit:**\n   The uniqueness of the limit of the Fourier series implies that if the Fourier coefficients are all zero, the function itself must be zero almost everywhere.\n\n### Final Statement\n\nThus, we have shown that if \\( f \\in L^1(G) \\) and \\(\\widehat{f}(n) = 0\\) for all \\( n \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\), then \\( f = 0 \\) almost everywhere on \\( G \\).
