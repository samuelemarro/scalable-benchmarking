        "answer": "To prove or disprove $a \\neq b$ using the given logical system, we need to reason through the axioms and rules of inference provided.\n\nGiven:\n1. Axiom 1: $\\forall x \\in D, P(x) \\rightarrow Q(x)$\n2. Axiom 2: $P(a)$\n3. Axiom 3: $\\neg Q(b)$\n4. Rule of Inference: Modus Ponens\n\nWe will start by applying Modus Ponens to Axiom 1 and Axiom 2:\nFrom Axiom 1: $\\forall x \\in D, P(x) \\rightarrow Q(x)$\nSubstitute $x = a$: $P(a) \\rightarrow Q(a)$\n\nNow, using Modus Ponens with Axiom 2: $P(a)$\nWe can infer: $Q(a)$\n\nNext, we will use the contrapositive of Axiom 1:\n$\\neg Q(x) \\rightarrow \\neg P(x)$\n\nSubstitute $x = b$: $\\neg Q(b) \\rightarrow \\neg P(b)$\n\nGiven Axiom 3: $\\neg Q(b)$, we can infer: $\\neg P(b)$\n\nNow, combining the information we have:\n1. $Q(a)$\n2. $\\neg P(b)$\n\nSince $Q(a)$ holds and $\\neg P(b)$ holds, it implies that $a \\neq b$.\n\nTherefore, we have proved that $a \\neq b$ using the logical system provided.",

        "answer": "To prove that for a prime number $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, there exist integers $x$ and $y$ such that $p = x^2 + y^2$, we can use the fact that any prime $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$ can be expressed as the sum of two squares.\n\n### Proof:\n1. **Representation of Primes as Sum of Two Squares**:\n   - Any prime number $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$ can be expressed as the sum of two squares, i.e., $p = a^2 + b^2$ for some integers $a$ and $b$.\n\n2. **Fermat's Theorem on Sums of Two Squares**:\n   - Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares states that a prime $p$ can be expressed as the sum of two squares if and only if $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$.\n\n3. **Finding Integers $x$ and $y$ for $p = 13$**:\n   - Given $p = 13$ and $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, we can find integers $x$ and $y$ such that $13 = x^2 + y^2$.\n   - One possible solution is $x = 2$ and $y = 3$ since $13 = 2^2 + 3^2$.\n\nTherefore, for any prime number $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, there exist integers $x$ and $y$ such that $p = x^2 + y^2$. For $p = 13$, one such solution is $x = 2$ and $y = 3$ since $13 = 2^2 + 3^2$.",
