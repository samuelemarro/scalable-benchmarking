        "answer": "To prove that the maximum possible degree $s_{\\text{max}}$ occurs for some even $i$, we need to analyze the structure of the matrix $A$ and the sum of elements in each row.\n\nLet's first consider the condition for $a_{ij}$ to be 1: $a_{ij} = 1$ if $i \\neq j$ and $i+j$ is a prime number. This means that for any $i$, the elements $a_{i, i+2}$, $a_{i, i+4}$, $a_{i, i+6}$, and so on, will be 1, as $i + (i+2)$, $i + (i+4)$, $i + (i+6)$ are all even numbers, and the only even prime number is 2. Therefore, the elements $a_{i, i+2k}$ will be 1 for all $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nNow, let's consider the sum of elements in row $i$, denoted as $s_i$. Since $a_{ii} = 0$ for all $i$, the sum $s_i$ is simply the number of 1's in row $i$. From the above observation, we see that the number of 1's in row $i$ will be maximized when $i$ is even, as all the elements $a_{i, i+2k}$ are 1.\n\nTo formalize this, let's define $s_{\\text{max}}$ as the maximum possible degree, which is the maximum sum of elements in a row. Let $s_{\\text{max}}$ be achieved at row $i = m$. We want to show that $m$ is even.\n\nAssume for contradiction that $m$ is odd. Then, $m+1$ is even. Since $s_{\\text{max}}$ is the maximum sum of elements in a row, we have $s_{\\text{max}} \\geq s_{m+1}$. However, from our observation, we know that $s_{m+1} > s_m$ because all the elements $a_{m+1, m+1+2k}$ are 1, which are additional 1's compared to row $m$. This contradicts the assumption that $s_{\\text{max}}$ is achieved at row $m$. Therefore, $m$ must be even.\n\nThus, we have proved that the maximum possible degree $s_{\\text{max}}$ occurs for some even $i$."

        "answer": "**Solution:**\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the closed form of $z_n$:**\n\nGiven the recursive definition of the sequence $z_n$:\n\n1. We start by expanding $z_{n+1}$ using the recursive formula:\n$$\nz_{n+1} = (1 + 2i)z_n + (2 - i)\n$$\n\n2. Substituting the recursive formula into itself, we get:\n$$\nz_{n+1} = (1 + 2i)((1 + 2i)z_{n-1} + (2 - i)) + (2 - i)\n$$\n\n3. Continuing this process, we can write $z_{n+1}$ in terms of $z_1$ as follows:\n$$\nz_{n+1} = (1 + 2i)^n z_1 + (1 + 2i)^{n-1}(2 - i) + \\ldots + (2 - i)\n$$\n\n4. Simplifying the above expression, we get:\n$$\nz_{n+1} = (1 + 2i)^n + (1 + 2i)^{n-1}(2 - i) + \\ldots + (2 - i)\n$$\n\n5. To find a closed form for $z_n$, we need to express $(1 + 2i)^n$ in a simpler form. We can use De Moivre's theorem for this purpose:\n$$\n(1 + 2i)^n = \\sqrt{5}^n \\left(\\cos(n\\theta) + i\\sin(n\\theta)\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\theta = \\arctan(2/1) = \\arctan(2)$.\n\n6.

To determine the limit of convergence, we need to analyze the behavior of the terms in the closed form of $z_n$ and see if they tend to a specific value as $n \\to \\infty$.\n\nIn conclusion, the convergence of $z_n$ and its limit as $n \\to \\infty$ will depend on the values of $\\theta$ and the terms involving $\\sqrt{5}$ in the closed form expression derived earlier.

Pre-multiplying by $T$ and post-multiplying by $T^*$ on both sides of $U^*T^* = T^*U$, we get:\n\n$$T(U^*T^*) = T(T^*U)$$\n$$\\Rightarrow (TU)^*T^* = T(T^*U)$$\n$$\\Rightarrow TU^*T^* = TT^*U$$\n$$\\Rightarrow TU^*T^* = T^*TU$$\n$$\\Rightarrow TU^*T = T^*TU$$\n\nSince $T$ is normal, we have $T^*T = TT^*$.

        "answer": "To prove that $f(x)$ is an even function, we will use the given functional equation and the fact that $f(0) = 1$.\n\n1. Proving $f(x)$ is an even function:\nLet $x = y$, then the functional equation becomes:\n$$ f(2x) + f(0) = 2f(x)f(x) $$\n$$ f(2x) + 1 = 2f(x)^2 $$\n\nNow, let $x = -x$, then the functional equation becomes:\n$$ f(0) + f(-2x) = 2f(-x)f(x) $$\n$$ 1 + f(-2x) = 2f(-x)f(x) $$\n\nAdding the two equations above, we get:\n$$ f(2x) + f(-2x) + 1 = 2(f(x)^2 + f(-x)f(x)) $$\n$$ f(2x) + f(-2x) + 1 = 2f(x)(f(x) + f(-x)) $$\n\nSince $f(0) = 1$, we have:\n$$ f(2x) + f(-2x) = 2f(x) $$\n\nTherefore, $f(x)$ is an even function, i.e., $f(-x) = f(x)$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n2. Showing that $f(x) = \\cos(kx) for some constant $k \\in \\mathbb{R}$:\nSince $f(x)$ is an even function, we can write $f(x) = g(x^2)$ for some function $g$. Substituting this into the functional equation, we get:\n$$ g(x^2 + y^2) + g(x^2 - y^2) = 2g(x^2)g(y^2) $$\n\nThis functional equation is similar to the functional equation for the cosine function. By comparing the two equations, we can see that $g(t) = \\cos(kt)$ for some constant $k$. Therefore, $f(x) = \\cos(kx)$ for some constant $k \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThis completes the proof."

        "answer": "**Solution:**\n\n**1. Derivation of the general solution:**\n\nGiven the differential equation:\n\n$$ f''(x) + f(x) = \\sin^2(x) $$\n\nTo solve this second-order linear homogeneous differential equation, we first find the complementary function by solving the associated homogeneous equation:\n\n$$ f''(x) + f(x) = 0 $$\n\nThe characteristic equation corresponding to this homogeneous equation is:\n\n$$ r^2 + 1 = 0 $$\n\nThis gives us the characteristic roots $r = \\pm i$. Therefore, the complementary function is of the form:\n\n$$ f_c(x) = A\\cos(x) + B\\sin(x) $$\n\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants to be determined.\n\nNext, we find a particular solution to the non-homogeneous equation. Since the right-hand side is $\\sin^2(x)$, we try a particular solution of the form:\n\n$$ f_p(x) = C\\sin^2(x) $$\n\nwhere $C$ is a constant to be determined.\n\nDifferentiating $f_p(x)$ twice and substituting into the differential equation, we get:\n\n$$ f_p''(x) + f_p(x) = 2C\\sin(x)\\cos(x) + C\\sin^2(x) = \\sin^2(x) $$\n\nThis implies $2C\\sin(x)\\cos(x) = 0$, which holds for all $x$. Therefore, $C = 0$.\n\nHence, the general solution to the differential equation is:\n\n$$ f(x) = f_c(x) = A\\cos(x) + B\\sin(x) $$\n\n**2. Selection of solution for boundedness as $x \\to \\infty$:**\n\nGiven that $f(x)$ is bounded as $x \\to \\infty$, we need to ensure that the terms involving $\\cos(x)$ and $\\sin(x)$ do not grow unbounded as $x$ becomes large.\n\nFor $f(x)$ to be bounded, the coefficients $A$ and $B$ must be such that the terms do not grow indefinitely. Since $\\cos(x)$ and $\\sin(x)$ oscillate between $-1$ and $1$, the coefficients $A$ and $B$ must be chosen in a way that the combination $A\\cos(x) + B\\sin(x)$ remains bounded.\n\nOne way to achieve this is to set $A = 0$ and $B = 0$, which results in $f(x) = 0$, a constant function that is clearly bounded.\n\nTherefore, the specific form of $f(x)$ that satisfies the boundedness condition as $x \\to \\infty$ is $f(x) = 0$."
