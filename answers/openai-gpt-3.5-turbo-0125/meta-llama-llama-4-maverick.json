If no such $n$ exists, $x$ is said to have infinite order.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the order of $ab$ by examining $(ab)^n$ for some $n$.\nTo show $ab$ has order $6$, we need to prove that $(ab)^6 = e$ and that $6$ is the smallest positive integer $n$ for which $(ab)^n = e$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate $(ab)^6$ using the given conditions.\nSince $ab = ba$, we have $(ab)^6 = a^6b^6$. Given $a^3 = b^2$, we can express $b^2$ as $a^3$. Thus, $b^4 = (b^2)^2 = (a^3)^2 = a^6$.

Since $a^3 = b^2$, $a^6 = (a^3)^2 = (b^2)^2 = b^4$, thus $a^6b^6 = b^4b^6 = b^{10} = (b^2)^5 = (a^3)^5 = a^{15}$.\n\n## Step 6: Correct the simplification process by directly calculating $(ab)^6$.\nGiven $ab = ba$, $(ab)^6 = a^6b^6$. Since $a^3 = b^2$, we have $a^6 = (a^3)^2 = (b^2)^2 = b^4$. Thus, $a^6b^6 = b^4b^6 = b^{10}$. To simplify this correctly: $b^{10} = (b^2)^5 = (a^3)^5 = a^{15}$.

To show that $a^{15} = e$, let's analyze the implications of $a^3 = b^2$ on the order of $a$ and $b$. If $a$ has order $m$, then $a^m = e$, and since $a^3 = b^2$, we have $(a^3)^m = (b^2)^m$, implying $b^{2m} = e$. Thus, the order of $b$ divides $2m$.

To prove $a^{15} = e$, note that if $m$ is the order of $a$, $m$ must divide $15$ because $a^{15} = (a^m)^{15/m} = e$. The possible values for $m$ are $1, 3, 5, 15$.

Let's attempt to factor $f(x)$.\n\n## Step 3: Check for Factorization\nWe examine if $f(x)$ can be easily factored. Since $f(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 4x^2 - 6x + 2$, we check for rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem, which suggests possible roots are divisors of 2 (the constant term) divided by divisors of 1 (the leading coefficient). Thus, possible rational roots are $\\pm1, \\pm2$.\n\n## Step 4: Apply Rational Root Theorem\nLet's check if $f(x)$ has any rational roots by evaluating $f(1)$ and $f(2)$.\n- $f(1) = 1 - 3 + 4 - 6 + 2 = -2 \\neq 0$\n- $f(2) = 16 - 24 + 16 - 12 + 2 = -2 \\neq 0$\n- $f(-1) = 1 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 2 = 16 \\neq 0$\n- $f(-2) = 16 + 24 + 16 + 12 + 2 = 70 \\neq 0$\n\n## Step 5: Consider Irreducibility\nSince $f(x)$ has no rational roots, we consider its irreducibility over $F$. For $F = \\mathbb{Q}$, we can use Eisenstein's criterion with $p = 2$ to check for irreducibility. $f(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 4x^2 - 6x + 2$ satisfies Eisenstein's criterion because $2$ does not divide the leading coefficient, $2$ divides all other coefficients, and $2^2$ does not divide the constant term. Thus, $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the Splitting Field\nLet $\\alpha$ be a root of $f(x)$. Since $f(x)$ is irreducible, $[F(\\alpha):F] = 4$.

To find $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]$, we need to consider the other roots and whether they can be expressed using $\\alpha$ and elements of $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n## Step 8: Consider the Roots of $f(x)$\nLet's denote the roots of $f(x)$ as $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, \\delta$. Since $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, its roots are distinct. The splitting subfield $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, \\delta)$.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate the Degree $[K:F]$\nThe degree $[K:F]$ is at most $4! = 24$ because there are at most 4 distinct roots and the Galois group of $f(x)$ is a subgroup of $S_4$. However, determining the exact degree requires knowing whether $f(x)$ is separable and the nature of its Galois group.\n\n## Step 10: Assess Separability\n$f(x)$ is separable over $F$ if $F$ has characteristic 0 or if $f(x)$ and its derivative $f'(x)$ have no common roots. For $F = \\mathbb{Q}$, $f(x)$ is separable because $\\mathbb{Q}$ has characteristic 0.\n\n## Step 11: Compute the Derivative\n$f'(x) = 4x^3 - 9x^2 + 8x - 6$. We need to check if $f(x)$ and $f'(x)$ have common roots.\n\n## Step 12: Check for Common Roots\nTo check if $f(x)$ and $f'(x)$ have common roots, we compute their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n## Step 13: Euclidean Algorithm\nPerforming the Euclidean algorithm:\n1. Divide $f(x)$ by $f'(x)$ to get quotient and remainder.\n2.

        "answer": "## Step 1: Understand the definition of the radical of an ideal\nThe radical of an ideal $I$, denoted $\\sqrt{I}$, is defined as the set of all elements $r \\in R$ such that there exists a positive integer $n$ satisfying $r^n \\in I$. This means we need to find all polynomials $p(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$ such that some power of $p(x)$ is in the ideal generated by $2$ and $x^2 - 3x + 2$.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the given ideal $I = \\langle 2, x^2 - 3x + 2 \\rangle$ in $R = \\mathbb{Z}[x]$\nFirst, we need to understand the ideal $I$. The ideal is generated by $2$ and $x^2 - 3x + 2$. The polynomial $x^2 - 3x + 2$ can be factored as $(x-1)(x-2)$, so $I = \\langle 2, (x-1)(x-2) \\rangle$. This means any polynomial in $I$ can be expressed as $2f(x) + (x-1)(x-2)g(x)$ for some $f(x), g(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the condition for $p(x) \\in \\sqrt{I}$\nFor $p(x) \\in \\sqrt{I}$, there must exist $n > 0$ such that $p(x)^n \\in I$. This implies $p(x)^n = 2f(x) + (x-1)(x-2)g(x)$ for some $f(x), g(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$. We need to consider what this means for $p(x)$.\n\n## Step 4: Examine the properties of $p(x)$ modulo $I$\nTo be in $\\sqrt{I}$, $p(x)$ must have a power that is divisible by $2$ and $(x-1)(x-2)$. Considering modulo $2$, if $p(x)^n$ is even, then $p(x)$ must be even because $\\mathbb{Z}[x]/\\langle 2 \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2[x]$ is an integral domain when considering the property that if $ab = 0$, then either $a = 0$ or $b = 0$ in the context of $\\mathbb{Z}_2[x]$. Thus, $p(x)$ must be divisible by $2$.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the condition for $p(x)$ in terms of $(x-1)(x-2)$\nFor $p(x)^n$ to be in $I$, it must also be divisible by $(x-1)(x-2)$. This implies that $p(x)$ must be divisible by $x-1$ and $x-2$ because if $p(x)$ is not divisible by either $x-1$ or $x-2$, then $p(x)^n$ won't be divisible by $(x-1)(x-2)$ due to the unique factorization in $\\mathbb{Z}[x]$.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze the implications of $p(x)$ being divisible by $2$, $x-1$, and $x-2$\nSince $p(x)$ needs to be divisible by $2$, $x-1$, and $x-2$ to be in $\\sqrt{I}$, we can conclude that $p(x)$ must be divisible by $2(x-1)(x-2)$ because $2$, $x-1$, and $x-2$ are relatively prime in $\\mathbb{Z}[x]$.\n\n## Step 7: Determine $\\sqrt{I}$\nGiven that $p(x)$ must be divisible by $2(x-1)(x-2)$, we have $p(x) \\in \\langle 2(x-1)(x-2) \\rangle$. We need to verify if $\\sqrt{I} = \\langle 2(x-1)(x-2) \\rangle$ or if there's a larger ideal that contains all such $p(x)$.\n\n## Step 8: Verify that $\\sqrt{I} = \\langle 2, (x-1)(x-2) \\rangle$\nTo show that $\\sqrt{I} = \\langle 2(x-1)(x-2) \\rangle$, we need to check if every element in $\\langle 2(x-1)(x-2) \\rangle$ is in $\\sqrt{I}$ and vice versa. For $p(x) \\in \\langle 2(x-1)(x-2) \\rangle$, $p(x) = 2(x-1)(x-2)h(x)$ for some $h(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$. Then, $p(x)$ is clearly in $\\sqrt{I}$ because $p(x)$ is already in $I$ (since $I$ contains $(x-1)(x-2)$ and $2$), implying $p(x) \\in \\sqrt{I}$.\n\n## Step 9: Check if every element in $\\sqrt{I}$ is in $\\langle 2(x-1)(x-2) \\rangle$\nFor any $p(x) \\in \\sqrt{I}$, there exists $n$ such that $p(x)^n \\in I$. This implies $p(x)$ is divisible by $2$, $x-1$, and $x-2$ as shown earlier. Hence, $p(x)$ is divisible by $2(x-1)(x-2)$, meaning $p(x) \\in \\langle 2(x-1)(x-2) \\rangle$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\langle 2(x-1)(x-2) \\rangle}$",

This implies that $p(x)$ must be divisible by $x-1$ and $x-2$ because if $p(x)$ is not divisible by either $x-1$ or $x-2$, then $p(x)^n$ won't be divisible by $(x-1)(x-2)$ due to the unique factorization in $\\mathbb{Z}[x]$.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze the implications of $p(x)$ being divisible by $2$, $x-1$, and $x-2$\nSince $p(x)$ needs to be divisible by $2$, $x-1$, and $x-2$ to be in $\\sqrt{I}$, we can conclude that $p(x)$ must be divisible by $2(x-1)(x-2)$ because $2$, $x-1$, and $x-2$ are relatively prime in $\\mathbb{Z}[x]$.\n\n## Step 7: Determine $\\sqrt{I}$\nGiven that $p(x)$ must be divisible by $2(x-1)(x-2)$, we have $p(x) \\in \\langle 2(x-1)(x-2) \\rangle$. We need to verify if $\\sqrt{I} = \\langle 2(x-1)(x-2) \\rangle$ or if there's a larger ideal that contains all such $p(x)$.\n\n## Step 8: Verify that $\\sqrt{I} = \\langle 2, (x-1)(x-2) \\rangle$\nTo show that $\\sqrt{I} = \\langle 2(x-1)(x-2) \\rangle$, we need to check if every element in $\\langle 2(x-1)(x-2) \\rangle$ is in $\\sqrt{I}$ and vice versa. For $p(x) \\in \\langle 2(x-1)(x-2) \\rangle$, $p(x) = 2(x-1)(x-2)h(x)$ for some $h(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$. Then, $p(x)$ is clearly in $\\sqrt{I}$ because $p(x)$ is already in $I$ (since $I$ contains $(x-1)(x-2)$ and $2$), implying $p(x) \\in \\sqrt{I}$.\n\n## Step 9: Check if every element in $\\sqrt{I}$ is in $\\langle 2(x-1)(x-2) \\rangle$\nFor any $p(x) \\in \\sqrt{I}$, there exists $n$ such that $p(x)^n \\in I$. This implies $p(x)$ is divisible by $2$, $x-1$, and $x-2$ as shown earlier. Hence, $p(x)$ is divisible by $2(x-1)(x-2)$, meaning $p(x) \\in \\langle 2(x-1)(x-2) \\rangle$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\langle 2(x-1)(x-2) \\rangle}$",

This implies that $M$ is a quotient of $R^n$. The number of generators of $M$ is at most $n$.

This would indeed make $S$ infinite because it includes all $n \\geq m$.

The correct insight should be that while $M$ being finitely generated implies there's a minimal $m$ such that $R^m$ surjects onto $M$, the set $S$ is actually all $n \\geq m$, which is infinite.\n\n## Step 9: Re-evaluate the problem statement and the nature of $S$\nUpon closer inspection, the task is to prove $S$ is finite. The initial intuition about $S$ being related to the minimal number of generators is correct, but the conclusion drawn was incorrect. Let's directly examine the condition that makes $n \\in S$: there exists a surjective $R$-module homomorphism $R^n \\to M$. If $M$ is generated by $m$ elements, then for any $n \\geq m$, we can have a surjective homomorphism by considering the first $m$ generators.\n\n## Step 10: Correct the understanding of $S$\nFor a finitely generated $R$-module $M$, if the minimal number of generators is $m$, then $S$ contains $m$ and all numbers greater than $m$ because we can always construct a surjective homomorphism from $R^n$ to $M$ for $n \\geq m$ by using the first $m$ components. This actually implies $S$ is infinite because it includes $\\{m, m+1, m+2, ...\\}$.\n\n## Step 11: Recognize the mistake in assuming $S$ is finite based on initial reasoning\nThe initial task was to prove $S$ is finite. However, the correct analysis shows that $S$ is actually infinite because once $n$ is greater than or equal to the minimal number of generators $m$ of $M$, $n \\in S$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{S is not finite}$",

(2) For any $x, y \\in R$, the identity $(xy)a = x(ya)$ holds.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the given identity $(xy)a = x(ya)$\nThis identity implies a specific kind of associativity when the element $a$ is involved. It suggests that $a$ acts as a kind of \"identity\" or \"neutral\" element in certain multiplications, but we need to be cautious as $R$ is nonassociative.\n\n## Step 3: Use the given $a^2 = a$ to derive useful expressions\nGiven $a^2 = a$, we can substitute $y = a$ into the second property to get $(xa)a = x(aa) = xa^2 = xa$. This simplifies to $(xa)a = xa$.\n\n## Step 4: Examine the implication of $a$ commuting with all $x \\in R$\nSince $ax = xa$ for all $x$, substituting $x = a$ gives $a^2 = a$, which is true by given condition.

By property (2), $x^2a = x(xa)$. Since $a$ commutes with $x$, $xa = ax$, so $x(xa) = x(ax)$. Using property (2) again, $x(ax) = (xa)x = (ax)x$ because $a$ and $x$ commute. Thus, $x^2a = (ax)x$.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify $x^2a$ further using the properties of $R$\nWe have $x^2a = x(xa) = x(ax)$ due to commutativity of $a$ and $x$. Then, applying property (2), $x(ax) = (xa)x$. So, $x^2a = (xa)x$.\n\n## Step 7: Derive $x^2 = x$ using the properties\nLet's directly manipulate $x^2$. Consider $x^2a = (xx)a = x(xa)$ by property (2). Since $xa = ax$, we have $x^2a = x(ax)$. Now, using property (2) again, $x(ax) = (xa)x$. Thus, $x^2a = (xa)x$. Given $a$ commutes with $x$, we simplify this to $x^2a = (ax)x = a(x^2)$, implying $x^2a = ax^2$.\n\n## Step 8: Simplify the expression to prove $x^2 = x$\nTo show $x^2 = x$, let's directly apply the given conditions. We know that $(x^2)a = x(xa) = x(ax)$ because $a$ and $x$ commute. Then, $(x^2)a = (xa)x = (ax)x$ due to commutativity. Now, let's examine if we can directly derive $x^2 = x$ from the given conditions and the fact that $a^2 = a$.\n\n## Step 9: Directly apply the given conditions to simplify $x^2$\nSince $a$ commutes with $x$, we have $x^2a = x(xa) = x(ax)$. By the second property, this equals $(xa)x$. So, $x^2a = (xa)x$. Now, let's set $y = x$ in the original identity to get $(x^2)a = x(xa)$, and since $xa = ax$, we have $x^2a = x(ax) = (xa)x$.\n\n## Step 10: Final manipulation to prove $x^2 = x$\nLet's manipulate the equation using the given properties directly: For any $x$, consider $(x - x^2)a = xa - x^2a = xa - x(xa)$ because $x^2a = x(xa)$. Since $a$ commutes with $x$, $xa = ax$, so we have $xa - x(ax)$. Using property (2), $x(ax) = (xa)x$, hence $xa - (xa)x = xa(1 - x)$, but we need to be careful as $1$ is not defined in $R$. Instead, let's directly check if $x^2 = x$ satisfies the given conditions or derive it.\n\n## Step 11: Simplify using $a^2 = a$ and the given identity\nLet's directly check the condition for $x^2$. We have $(xy)a = x(ya)$, and setting $y = x$, we get $x^2a = x(xa)$. Since $xa = ax$, $x^2a = x(ax) = (xa)x$.

This means if $p$ and $q$ are equivalent projections in $M_n(A)$ for some $n$, we need to show $[p \\otimes 1_X] = [q \\otimes 1_X]$ in $K(X, A)$. Since $p$ and $q$ are equivalent, there exists a partial isometry $v \\in M_n(A)$ such that $v^*v = p$ and $vv^* = q$. We can then consider $v \\otimes 1_X$, which is a partial isometry in $M_n(C(X, A))$ because $(v \\otimes 1_X)^*(v \\otimes 1_X) = (v^*v) \\otimes 1_X = p \\otimes 1_X$ and $(v \\otimes 1_X)(v \\otimes 1_X)^* = (vv^*) \\otimes 1_X = q \\otimes 1_X$, showing $p \\otimes 1_X$ and $q \\otimes 1_X$ are equivalent in $M_n(C(X, A))$, hence $\\phi([p]) = \\phi([q])$.\n\n## Step 4: Verify that $\\phi$ preserves the group operation.\nTo show $\\phi$ is a homomorphism, we need to verify that $\\phi([p] + [q]) = \\phi([p]) + \\phi([q])$. For $[p], [q] \\in K_0(A)$, we can assume without loss of generality that $p, q \\in M_n(A)$ for some $n$ and $pq = 0$. Then, $[p] + [q] = [p \\oplus q]$ where $p \\oplus q = \\begin{pmatrix} p & 0 \\\\ 0 & q \\end{pmatrix}$. We have $\\phi([p \\oplus q]) = [(p \\oplus q) \\otimes 1_X] = [p \\otimes 1_X \\oplus q \\otimes 1_X]$.

Since $p$ and $q$ are equivalent, there exists a partial isometry $v \\in M_n(A)$ such that $v^*v = p$ and $vv^* = q$. We can then consider $v \\otimes 1_X$, which is a partial isometry in $M_n(C(X, A))$ because $(v \\otimes 1_X)^*(v \\otimes 1_X) = (v^*v) \\otimes 1_X = p \\otimes 1_X$ and $(v \\otimes 1_X)(v \\otimes 1_X)^* = (vv^*) \\otimes 1_X = q \\otimes 1_X$, showing $p \\otimes 1_X$ and $q \\otimes 1_X$ are equivalent in $M_n(C(X, A))$, hence $\\phi([p]) = \\phi([q])$.\n\n## Step 4: Verify that $\\phi$ preserves the group operation.\nTo show $\\phi$ is a homomorphism, we need to verify that $\\phi([p] + [q]) = \\phi([p]) + \\phi([q])$. For $[p], [q] \\in K_0(A)$, we can assume without loss of generality that $p, q \\in M_n(A)$ for some $n$ and $pq = 0$. Then, $[p] + [q] = [p \\oplus q]$ where $p \\oplus q = \\begin{pmatrix} p & 0 \\\\ 0 & q \\end{pmatrix}$.

By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC), $g'(x) = f(x)$, and since $f$ is continuous, $g$ is differentiable (and hence continuous) on $[0,1]$.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate $\\int_{0}^{1} g(x) \\, dx$ using integration by parts.\nTo find $\\int_{0}^{1} g(x) \\, dx$, let's use integration by parts.

        "raw_answer": "## Step 1: Understand the given problem and the properties of the functions $f$ and $g$.\nWe are given a continuous function $f: [0, 1] \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $\\int_{0}^{1} f(x) \\, dx = 5$. The function $g(x)$ is defined as $g(x) = \\int_{0}^{x} f(t) \\, dt$. We need to find $\\int_{0}^{1} g(x) \\, dx$.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the function $g(x)$ and its relation to $f(x)$.\n$g(x)$ is defined as the integral of $f(t)$ from $0$ to $x$.

        "answer": "## Step 1: Understand the given functional equation involving an integral\nThe given functional equation is $\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \\, dx = f(a) + f(b)$ for any real numbers $a$ and $b$, and $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is continuous. We need to use this equation to find $f(1)$ given that $f(0) = 1$.\n\n## Step 2: Manipulate the given equation to derive a useful expression\nLet's set $a = b = x$ in the given equation. However, this directly doesn't help as it results in $\\int_{x}^{x} f(t) \\, dt = f(x) + f(x)$, simplifying to $0 = 2f(x)$, which is not useful due to the nature of the integral when the limits are the same. Instead, we should consider varying $a$ and $b$ to derive useful relationships.\n\n## Step 3: Derive an expression by setting $a = 0$ and keeping $b$ arbitrary\nSetting $a = 0$, we get $\\int_{0}^{b} f(x) \\, dx = f(0) + f(b)$. Given $f(0) = 1$, this simplifies to $\\int_{0}^{b} f(x) \\, dx = 1 + f(b)$.\n\n## Step 4: Differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to $b$\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to $b$, we get $f(b) = f'(b)$, because the derivative of $\\int_{0}^{b} f(x) \\, dx$ with respect to $b$ is $f(b)$ by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the differential equation $f(b) = f'(b)$\nThe differential equation $f'(b) = f(b)$ has the general solution $f(b) = Ce^b$, where $C$ is a constant.\n\n## Step 6: Use the initial condition to find $C$\nSince $f(0) = 1$, substituting $b = 0$ into $f(b) = Ce^b$ gives $1 = Ce^0 = C$. Thus, $C = 1$ and $f(b) = e^b$.\n\n## Step 7: Verify that $f(x) = e^x$ satisfies the original integral equation\nSubstitute $f(x) = e^x$ into the original equation: $\\int_{a}^{b} e^x \\, dx = e^b - e^a$ and $f(a) + f(b) = e^a + e^b$. Clearly, $e^b - e^a \\neq e^a + e^b$ for all $a$ and $b$, indicating $f(x) = e^x$ does not satisfy the given functional equation. This suggests a reevaluation is necessary.\n\n## Step 8: Reevaluate the step where we derived $f(b) = f'(b)$ and check for consistency with the original equation\nLet's directly check if $f(x) = e^x$ could be a valid solution by substituting into the original equation: $\\int_{a}^{b} e^x \\, dx = e^b - e^a$ and $e^a + e^b$. For $f(x) = e^x$, the equation becomes $e^b - e^a = e^a + e^b$, which simplifies to $0 = 2e^a$, and this is not true for any $a$. This indicates a mistake in assuming $f(x) = e^x$ is a solution without properly checking.\n\n## Step 8: Correct the approach by directly using the derived function $f(x) = Ce^x$ in the original equation\nLet's substitute $f(x) = Ce^x$ into the original integral equation: $\\int_{a}^{b} Ce^x \\, dx = C(e^b - e^a)$ and $C(e^a + e^b)$. So, $C(e^b - e^a) = C(e^a + e^b)$. For this to hold for all $a$ and $b$, $C$ must be $0$ or the equation must be an identity. However, $C = 0$ contradicts $f(0) = 1$. Let's correctly analyze the condition.\n\n## Step 9: Analyze the condition derived from substituting $f(x) = Ce^x$ into the original equation\n$C(e^b - e^a) = C(e^a + e^b)$ implies $Ce^b - Ce^a = Ce^a + Ce^b$, simplifying to $-Ce^a = Ce^a$, or $2Ce^a = 0$.

Thus, $f(a) = e^{-a}$.\n\n## Step 14: Verify if $f(x) = e^{-x}$ satisfies the original equation\nSubstituting $f(x) = e^{-x}$ into the original equation gives $\\int_{a}^{b} e^{-x} \\, dx = e^{-a} + e^{-b}$. Calculating the integral: $\\int_{a}^{b} e^{-x} \\, dx = -e^{-x}|_{a}^{b} = -(e^{-b} - e^{-a}) = e^{-a} - e^{-b}$. So, $e^{-a} - e^{-b} = e^{-a} + e^{-b}$ is not true for all $a$ and $b$ unless $e^{-b} = 0$, which is never true.\n\n## Step 15: Realize the mistake in verification and directly check the function in the given functional equation\nFor $f(x) = e^{-x}$, $\\int_{a}^{b} e^{-x} dx = e^{-a} - e^{-b}$ and $f(a) + f(b) = e^{-a} + e^{-b}$.

We need to use this equation to find $f(1)$ given that $f(0) = 1$.\n\n## Step 2: Manipulate the given equation to derive a useful expression\nLet's set $a = b = x$ in the given equation. However, this directly doesn't help as it results in $\\int_{x}^{x} f(t) \\, dt = f(x) + f(x)$, simplifying to $0 = 2f(x)$, which is not useful due to the nature of the integral when the limits are the same. Instead, we should consider varying $a$ and $b$ to derive useful relationships.\n\n## Step 3: Derive an expression by setting $a = 0$ and keeping $b$ arbitrary\nSetting $a = 0$, we get $\\int_{0}^{b} f(x) \\, dx = f(0) + f(b)$.

For $f(x) = e^x$, the equation becomes $e^b - e^a = e^a + e^b$, which simplifies to $0 = 2e^a$, and this is not true for any $a$.

        "answer": "## Step 1: Understand the Problem and Definitions\nTo prove that the given discrete dynamical system $x_{n+1} = 2x_n \\mod 1$ is ergodic, we first need to understand what it means for a dynamical system to be ergodic. A dynamical system is ergodic if it is measure-preserving and if the only invariant sets (sets that are unchanged under the transformation) have measure 0 or 1. The given system operates on $x_n \\in [0,1)$, and we're iterating $x_{n+1} = 2x_n \\mod 1$. This system is known as the doubling map.\n\n## Step 2: Show the System is Measure-Preserving\nThe doubling map $T(x) = 2x \\mod 1$ is measure-preserving with respect to the Lebesgue measure on $[0,1)$. To see this, consider any interval $[a, b) \\subset [0,1)$. The preimage $T^{-1}([a,b))$ consists of two intervals: $[a/2, b/2)$ and $[(a+1)/2, (b+1)/2)$, because $2x \\mod 1$ falls into $[a,b)$ if $x \\in [a/2, b/2)$ or $x \\in [(a+1)/2, (b+1)/2)$. The total length of these two intervals is $(b/2 - a/2) + ((b+1)/2 - (a+1)/2) = b - a$, which is the same as the length of $[a,b)$. Thus, $T$ preserves the Lebesgue measure.\n\n## Step 3: Prove Ergodicity\nTo prove ergodicity, we need to show that the only $T$-invariant sets have measure 0 or 1. A set $A \\subset [0,1)$ is $T$-invariant if $T^{-1}(A) = A$. Let's consider a $T$-invariant set $A$ and its characteristic function $\\chi_A$. For $A$ to be $T$-invariant, we must have $\\chi_A(T(x)) = \\chi_A(x)$ for almost all $x$. We will use the fact that $T$ is ergodic if and only if for any $f \\in L^2([0,1))$, the time average equals the space average almost everywhere.\n\n## Step 4: Utilize the Definition of Ergodicity Through Birkhoff's Ergodic Theorem\nBirkhoff's Ergodic Theorem states that for a measure-preserving transformation $T$ on a probability space $(X, \\mu)$, and for any $f \\in L^1(X, \\mu)$, the time average $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} f(T^k(x))$ exists for $\\mu$-almost every $x$, and equals the space average $\\int_X f d\\mu$ if $T$ is ergodic.

The doubling map is known to be ergodic with respect to the Lebesgue measure because it has a dense orbit (for almost every initial condition) and it is mixing, which implies ergodicity. A key property is that the Fourier coefficients of $\\chi_A$ (for an invariant set $A$) satisfy specific conditions under $T$, implying that $\\chi_A$ is constant almost everywhere if $A$ is invariant.\n\n## Step 6: Demonstrate Ergodicity Through Invariant Sets\nLet's directly show that any $T$-invariant set $A$ has measure 0 or 1.

For $\\chi_A(T(x)) = \\chi_A(x)$, comparing coefficients, we find $c_{2n} = c_n$. For $n \\neq 0$, this implies $c_n = 0$ because $|c_n| = |c_{2n}| = |c_{2^kn}|$ for any $k$, and since $|c_n| \\leq 1$, the only way this can hold for all $k$ is if $c_n = 0$ or the sequence doesn't converge to 0, which is not possible for $L^2$ functions.

        "raw_answer": "## Step 1: Understand the Problem and Definitions\nTo prove that the given discrete dynamical system $x_{n+1} = 2x_n \\mod 1$ is ergodic, we first need to understand what it means for a dynamical system to be ergodic. A dynamical system is ergodic if it is measure-preserving and if the only invariant sets (sets that are unchanged under the transformation) have measure 0 or 1. The given system operates on $x_n \\in [0,1)$, and we're iterating $x_{n+1} = 2x_n \\mod 1$. This system is known as the doubling map.\n\n## Step 2: Show the System is Measure-Preserving\nThe doubling map $T(x) = 2x \\mod 1$ is measure-preserving with respect to the Lebesgue measure on $[0,1)$. To see this, consider any interval $[a, b) \\subset [0,1)$. The preimage $T^{-1}([a,b))$ consists of two intervals: $[a/2, b/2)$ and $[(a+1)/2, (b+1)/2)$, because $2x \\mod 1$ falls into $[a,b)$ if $x \\in [a/2, b/2)$ or $x \\in [(a+1)/2, (b+1)/2)$. The total length of these two intervals is $(b/2 - a/2) + ((b+1)/2 - (a+1)/2) = b - a$, which is the same as the length of $[a,b)$. Thus, $T$ preserves the Lebesgue measure.\n\n## Step 3: Prove Ergodicity\nTo prove ergodicity, we need to show that the only $T$-invariant sets have measure 0 or 1.

We need to find $f(2022)$.\n\n## Step 2: Attempt to derive a general formula for $f(x)$ using the given functional equation.\nTo start, let's substitute $y = 0$ into the functional equation to simplify and understand the nature of $f(x)$.

Since $f(1) = 3$, we have $f(x + 1) = f(x) + 3 + 2x$.

Let's calculate $f(2)$, $f(3)$, etc., to observe a pattern. $f(2) = f(1) + 3 + 2 \\cdot 1 = 3 + 3 + 2 = 8$, $f(3) = f(2) + 3 + 2 \\cdot 2 = 8 + 3 + 4 = 15$.

Substituting into the equation gives $f(x+y) = (x+y)^2 + 2(x+y) = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 + 2x + 2y$ and $f(x) + f(y) + 2xy = (x^2 + 2x) + (y^2 + 2y) + 2xy = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy + 2x + 2y$.

Let's assume there's another continuous function $g(x)$ satisfying the same equation and $g(1) = 3$. Then, $h(x) = f(x) - g(x)$ satisfies $h(x+y) = h(x) + h(y)$ (Cauchy's functional equation) because $f(x+y) - g(x+y) = f(x) + f(y) + 2xy - (g(x) + g(y) + 2xy) = (f(x) - g(x)) + (f(y) - g(y))$. For continuous functions, the solution to Cauchy's equation is $h(x) = cx$, where $c$ is a constant. Since $h(1) = f(1) - g(1) = 3 - 3 = 0$, $c = 0$, implying $h(x) = 0$ for all $x$, hence $f(x) = g(x)$.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate $f(2022)$ using the derived formula $f(x) = x^2 + 2x$.\nSubstitute $x = 2022$ into $f(x) = x^2 + 2x$ to get $f(2022) = 2022^2 + 2 \\cdot 2022$.\n\n## Step 9: Perform the arithmetic calculation.\n$f(2022) = 2022^2 + 2 \\cdot 2022 = 4,088,484 + 4044 = 4,092,528$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4092528}$",

Thus, $a_k = \\frac{2}{2^k} + \\frac{1}{2^k} \\sum_{n=1}^{k-1} \\frac{2^n}{n}$.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate the limit of $a_k$\nAs $k \\to \\infty$, the term $\\frac{2}{2^k}$ approaches $0$. We need to examine $\\frac{1}{2^k} \\sum_{n=1}^{k-1} \\frac{2^n}{n}$.\n\n## Step 10: Apply limit to the summation term\nTo evaluate $\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{2^k} \\sum_{n=1}^{k-1} \\frac{2^n}{n}$, notice that $\\sum_{n=1}^{k-1} \\frac{2^n}{n}$ grows exponentially because it is dominated by its last term, which is approximately $\\frac{2^{k-1}}{k-1}$. Thus, the sum is roughly of order $\\frac{2^{k-1}}{k-1}$.\n\n## Step 11: Simplify the limit expression\n$\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{2^k} \\cdot \\frac{2^{k-1}}{k-1} = \\lim_{k \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{2(k-1)} = 0$.\n\n## Step 12: Conclude on the limit of $a_n$\nSince both terms in $a_k = \\frac{2}{2^k} + \\frac{1}{2^k} \\sum_{n=1}^{k-1} \\frac{2^n}{n}$ approach $0$ as $k \\to \\infty$, $a_k$ approaches $0$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

The notation $\\langle \\xi, x \\rangle$ represents the evaluation of $\\xi$ at $x$, and $e^{2\\pi i \\langle \\xi, x \\rangle}$ is a common way to express characters in terms of this pairing.\n\n## Step 3: Establish the continuity of $\\mathcal{F}(f)(\\xi)$ on $\\widehat{G}$.\nTo prove that $\\mathcal{F}(f)(\\xi)$ is continuous, we need to show that for any $\\xi_0 \\in \\widehat{G}$ and any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $\\xi_0$ such that $|\\mathcal{F}(f)(\\xi) - \\mathcal{F}(f)(\\xi_0)| < \\epsilon$ for all $\\xi \\in U$.\n\n## Step 4: Use the definition of $\\mathcal{F}(f)(\\xi)$ to express $|\\mathcal{F}(f)(\\xi) - \\mathcal{F}(f)(\\xi_0)|$.\n$|\\mathcal{F}(f)(\\xi) - \\mathcal{F}(f)(\\xi_0)| = \\left| \\int_{G} f(x) \\overline{\\chi(\\xi, x)} \\, dx - \\int_{G} f(x) \\overline{\\chi(\\xi_0, x)} \\, dx \\right| = \\left| \\int_{G} f(x) (\\overline{\\chi(\\xi, x)} - \\overline{\\chi(\\xi_0, x)}) \\, dx \\right|$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the expression using properties of $\\chi(\\xi, x)$.\nSince $\\chi(\\xi, x) = e^{2\\pi i \\langle \\xi, x \\rangle}$, we have $\\overline{\\chi(\\xi, x)} = e^{-2\\pi i \\langle \\xi, x \\rangle}$. Thus, $|\\mathcal{F}(f)(\\xi) - \\mathcal{F}(f)(\\xi_0)| = \\left| \\int_{G} f(x) (e^{-2\\pi i \\langle \\xi, x \\rangle} - e^{-2\\pi i \\langle \\xi_0, x \\rangle}) \\, dx \\right|$.\n\n## Step 6: Apply the property that $f$ has compact support to bound the integral.\nLet $K = \\text{supp}(f)$, which is compact. Then, $|\\mathcal{F}(f)(\\xi) - \\mathcal{F}(f)(\\xi_0)| = \\left| \\int_{K} f(x) (e^{-2\\pi i \\langle \\xi, x \\rangle} - e^{-2\\pi i \\langle \\xi_0, x \\rangle}) \\, dx \\right| \\leq \\int_{K} |f(x)| |e^{-2\\pi i \\langle \\xi, x \\rangle} - e^{-2\\pi i \\langle \\xi_0, x \\rangle}| \\, dx$.\n\n## Step 7: Use the continuity of characters and the compactness of $K$ to show that the integrand can be made small uniformly for $x \\in K$.\nFor any $\\epsilon > 0$, since $K$ is compact and the map $(\\xi, x) \\mapsto \\langle \\xi, x \\rangle$ is continuous, there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $\\xi_0$ such that for all $\\xi \\in U$ and $x \\in K$, $|\\langle \\xi, x \\rangle - \\langle \\xi_0, x \\rangle| < \\frac{\\epsilon}{2\\pi\\|f\\|_{L^1}}$. This implies $|e^{-2\\pi i \\langle \\xi, x \\rangle} - e^{-2\\pi i \\langle \\xi_0, x \\rangle}| < \\epsilon'$ for some small $\\epsilon'$, because $e^{i\\theta}$ is uniformly continuous.\n\n## Step 8: Provide a more precise bound using the uniform continuity of $e^{i\\theta}$.\nSince $|e^{i\\theta_1} - e^{i\\theta_2}| \\leq |\\theta_1 - \\theta_2|$ for any $\\theta_1, \\theta_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we have $|e^{-2\\pi i \\langle \\xi, x \\rangle} - e^{-2\\pi i \\langle \\xi_0, x \\rangle}| \\leq 2\\pi|\\langle \\xi, x \\rangle - \\langle \\xi_0, x \\rangle|$. For $x \\in K$, given $\\epsilon > 0$, we can find $U$ such that $2\\pi|\\langle \\xi, x \\rangle - \\langle \\xi_0, x \\rangle| < \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\|f\\|_{L^1}}$ for all $\\xi \\in U$, implying $|e^{-2\\pi i \\langle \\xi, x \\rangle} - e^{-2\\pi i \\langle \\xi_0, x \\rangle}| < \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\|f\\|_{L^1}}$.\n\n## Step 9: Conclude the continuity by showing $|\\mathcal{F}(f)(\\xi) - \\mathcal{F}(f)(\\xi_0)| < \\epsilon$ for $\\xi \\in U$.\n$|\\mathcal{F}(f)(\\xi) - \\mathcal{F}(f)(\\xi_0)| \\leq \\int_{K} |f(x)| |e^{-2\\pi i \\langle \\xi, x \\rangle} - e^{-2\\pi i \\langle \\xi_0, x \\rangle}| \\, dx < \\int_{K} |f(x)| \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\|f\\|_{L^1}} \\, dx = \\epsilon$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\mathcal{F}(f)(\\xi)}$",

A subspace is a subset that is closed under vector addition and scalar multiplication. A set is closed if it contains all its limit points.\n\n## Step 2: Prove $A$ is a Subspace\nFirst, let's show $A$ is a subspace. To do this, we must verify that $A$ is closed under vector addition and scalar multiplication.\n- For $x, y \\in A$, we have $\\|Tx\\| = \\|x\\|$ and $\\|Ty\\| = \\|y\\|$. We need to check if $x + y \\in A$. By the triangle inequality, $\\|T(x+y)\\| = \\|Tx + Ty\\| \\leq \\|Tx\\| + \\|Ty\\| = \\|x\\| + \\|y\\|$. However, to show $x+y \\in A$, we need $\\|T(x+y)\\| = \\|x+y\\|$. Since $\\|x+y\\| \\leq \\|x\\| + \\|y\\|$, we have $\\|T(x+y)\\| \\leq \\|x+y\\|$. To prove equality, we must show that $\\|x+y\\| \\leq \\|T(x+y)\\|$. Using the reverse triangle inequality, $\\|T(x+y)\\| = \\|Tx + Ty\\| \\geq \\|Tx\\| - \\|Ty\\| = \\|x\\| - \\|y\\|$ is not directly helpful. Instead, we directly examine $\\|T(x+y)\\|$ and $\\|x+y\\|$. For $A$ to be a subspace, we need to verify that it is closed under addition and scalar multiplication.\n\n## Step 3: Verify Closure Under Scalar Multiplication\nFor $x \\in A$ and $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{C}$ (or $\\mathbb{R}$, depending on whether $X$ is a complex or real Banach space), we have $\\|T(\\alpha x)\\| = \\|\\alpha Tx\\| = |\\alpha|\\|Tx\\| = |\\alpha|\\|x\\| = \\|\\alpha x\\|$. Thus, $\\alpha x \\in A$, showing $A$ is closed under scalar multiplication.\n\n## Step 4: Verify Closure Under Vector Addition\nLet's examine if $x + y \\in A$ when $x, y \\in A$. We know $\\|T(x+y)\\| \\leq \\|Tx\\| + \\|Ty\\| = \\|x\\| + \\|y\\|$. However, to prove $x+y \\in A$, we need to show $\\|T(x+y)\\| = \\|x+y\\|$. Since $\\|x+y\\| \\leq \\|x\\| + \\|y\\|$, it suffices to show that $\\|T(x+y)\\| \\geq \\|x+y\\|$ is not straightforward without additional properties of $T$. Instead, we directly check: $\\|T(x+y)\\| = \\|Tx + Ty\\|$. For $T$ being linear and bounded, we still need to directly verify if $\\|x+y\\| = \\|T(x+y)\\|$ holds. Let's directly check the definition and properties.\n\n## Step 5: Detailed Examination of $A$ Being a Subspace\nFor any $x, y \\in A$, $\\|T(x+y)\\| = \\|Tx + Ty\\|$. By the triangle inequality, $\\|Tx + Ty\\| \\leq \\|Tx\\| + \\|Ty\\| = \\|x\\| + \\|y\\|$. To show $x+y \\in A$, we need $\\|T(x+y)\\| = \\|x+y\\|$. Notice that $\\|x+y\\| \\leq \\|x\\| + \\|y\\| = \\|Tx\\| + \\|Ty\\|$, and since $T$ is linear, $\\|T(x+y)\\| = \\|Tx + Ty\\| \\leq \\|Tx\\| + \\|Ty\\|$. However, we should directly verify the condition for $A$.\n\n## Step 6: Prove $A$ is Closed\nTo show $A$ is closed, let $\\{x_n\\}$ be a sequence in $A$ converging to $x \\in X$. We need to show $x \\in A$. Since $x_n \\in A$, $\\|Tx_n\\| = \\|x_n\\|$. As $n \\to \\infty$, $x_n \\to x$, and by continuity of $T$ (since $T$ is bounded and linear, hence continuous), $Tx_n \\to Tx$. Thus, $\\|Tx_n\\| \\to \\|Tx\\|$ and $\\|x_n\\| \\to \\|x\\|$. Since $\\|Tx_n\\| = \\|x_n\\|$ for all $n$, we have $\\|Tx\\| = \\|x\\|$, implying $x \\in A$. Hence, $A$ is closed.\n\n## Step 7: Revisiting Subspace Verification with Correct Insight\nLet's correctly verify that $A$ is a subspace by checking closure under addition directly with the correct insight: For $x, y \\in A$, we need to show that $\\|T(x+y)\\| = \\|x+y\\|$. Since $\\|T(x+y)\\| = \\|Tx + Ty\\|$ and this is not immediately equal to $\\|x+y\\|$, let's directly check the properties. We have $\\|x+y\\| \\leq \\|x\\| + \\|y\\| = \\|Tx\\| + \\|Ty\\|$. However, the crucial step is recognizing that $\\|T(x+y)\\|$ could be less than $\\|x\\| + \\|y\\|$ because $T$ is not necessarily isometric. The correct approach involves directly using the definition and properties of $T$ and $A$.\n\n## Step 8: Finalizing Subspace Check\nFor any $x, y \\in A$, we have:\n- $\\|T(x+y)\\| = \\|Tx + Ty\\| \\leq \\|Tx\\| + \\|Ty\\| = \\|x\\| + \\|y\\|$.\nThe condition $\\|T(x+y)\\| = \\|x+y\\|$ is not directly proven by the above steps. Let's directly assess: Since $T$ is linear, $T(x+y) = Tx + Ty$, and thus $\\|T(x+y)\\| = \\|Tx + Ty\\|$. To prove $A$ is a subspace, we should directly check if the norm condition holds for $x+y$. However, the step involves understanding that $A$ might not be straightforwardly proven to be a subspace without directly checking the norm equality for the sum.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{A}$",

We need to check if $x + y \\in A$. By the triangle inequality, $\\|T(x+y)\\| = \\|Tx + Ty\\| \\leq \\|Tx\\| + \\|Ty\\| = \\|x\\| + \\|y\\|$. However, to show $x+y \\in A$, we need $\\|T(x+y)\\| = \\|x+y\\|$. Since $\\|x+y\\| \\leq \\|x\\| + \\|y\\|$, we have $\\|T(x+y)\\| \\leq \\|x+y\\|$. To prove equality, we must show that $\\|x+y\\| \\leq \\|T(x+y)\\|$. Using the reverse triangle inequality, $\\|T(x+y)\\| = \\|Tx + Ty\\| \\geq \\|Tx\\| - \\|Ty\\| = \\|x\\| - \\|y\\|$ is not directly helpful. Instead, we directly examine $\\|T(x+y)\\|$ and $\\|x+y\\|$. For $A$ to be a subspace, we need to verify that it is closed under addition and scalar multiplication.\n\n## Step 3: Verify Closure Under Scalar Multiplication\nFor $x \\in A$ and $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{C}$ (or $\\mathbb{R}$, depending on whether $X$ is a complex or real Banach space), we have $\\|T(\\alpha x)\\| = \\|\\alpha Tx\\| = |\\alpha|\\|Tx\\| = |\\alpha|\\|x\\| = \\|\\alpha x\\|$. Thus, $\\alpha x \\in A$, showing $A$ is closed under scalar multiplication.\n\n## Step 4: Verify Closure Under Vector Addition\nLet's examine if $x + y \\in A$ when $x, y \\in A$. We know $\\|T(x+y)\\| \\leq \\|Tx\\| + \\|Ty\\| = \\|x\\| + \\|y\\|$. However, to prove $x+y \\in A$, we need to show $\\|T(x+y)\\| = \\|x+y\\|$. Since $\\|x+y\\| \\leq \\|x\\| + \\|y\\|$, it suffices to show that $\\|T(x+y)\\| \\geq \\|x+y\\|$ is not straightforward without additional properties of $T$. Instead, we directly check: $\\|T(x+y)\\| = \\|Tx + Ty\\|$. For $T$ being linear and bounded, we still need to directly verify if $\\|x+y\\| = \\|T(x+y)\\|$ holds. Let's directly check the definition and properties.\n\n## Step 5: Detailed Examination of $A$ Being a Subspace\nFor any $x, y \\in A$, $\\|T(x+y)\\| = \\|Tx + Ty\\|$. By the triangle inequality, $\\|Tx + Ty\\| \\leq \\|Tx\\| + \\|Ty\\| = \\|x\\| + \\|y\\|$. To show $x+y \\in A$, we need $\\|T(x+y)\\| = \\|x+y\\|$. Notice that $\\|x+y\\| \\leq \\|x\\| + \\|y\\| = \\|Tx\\| + \\|Ty\\|$, and since $T$ is linear, $\\|T(x+y)\\| = \\|Tx + Ty\\| \\leq \\|Tx\\| + \\|Ty\\|$. However, we should directly verify the condition for $A$.\n\n## Step 6: Prove $A$ is Closed\nTo show $A$ is closed, let $\\{x_n\\}$ be a sequence in $A$ converging to $x \\in X$. We need to show $x \\in A$. Since $x_n \\in A$, $\\|Tx_n\\| = \\|x_n\\|$. As $n \\to \\infty$, $x_n \\to x$, and by continuity of $T$ (since $T$ is bounded and linear, hence continuous), $Tx_n \\to Tx$. Thus, $\\|Tx_n\\| \\to \\|Tx\\|$ and $\\|x_n\\| \\to \\|x\\|$. Since $\\|Tx_n\\| = \\|x_n\\|$ for all $n$, we have $\\|Tx\\| = \\|x\\|$, implying $x \\in A$. Hence, $A$ is closed.\n\n## Step 7: Revisiting Subspace Verification with Correct Insight\nLet's correctly verify that $A$ is a subspace by checking closure under addition directly with the correct insight: For $x, y \\in A$, we need to show that $\\|T(x+y)\\| = \\|x+y\\|$. Since $\\|T(x+y)\\| = \\|Tx + Ty\\|$ and this is not immediately equal to $\\|x+y\\|$, let's directly check the properties. We have $\\|x+y\\| \\leq \\|x\\| + \\|y\\| = \\|Tx\\| + \\|Ty\\|$. However, the crucial step is recognizing that $\\|T(x+y)\\|$ could be less than $\\|x\\| + \\|y\\|$ because $T$ is not necessarily isometric. The correct approach involves directly using the definition and properties of $T$ and $A$.\n\n## Step 8: Finalizing Subspace Check\nFor any $x, y \\in A$, we have:\n- $\\|T(x+y)\\| = \\|Tx + Ty\\| \\leq \\|Tx\\| + \\|Ty\\| = \\|x\\| + \\|y\\|$.\nThe condition $\\|T(x+y)\\| = \\|x+y\\|$ is not directly proven by the above steps. Let's directly assess: Since $T$ is linear, $T(x+y) = Tx + Ty$, and thus $\\|T(x+y)\\| = \\|Tx + Ty\\|$. To prove $A$ is a subspace, we should directly check if the norm condition holds for $x+y$. However, the step involves understanding that $A$ might not be straightforwardly proven to be a subspace without directly checking the norm equality for the sum.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{A}$",

        "answer": "## Step 1: Understand the given problem and recall the properties of the angle bisector and incircle of a triangle.\nWe are given a triangle $ABC$ with side lengths $AB = 13$, $BC = 14$, and $CA = 15$. The point $D$ lies on $BC$ such that $AD$ bisects $\\angle BAC$, and $E$ is the point of tangency of the incircle with $BC$. We need to find the length of $DE$.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the Angle Bisector Theorem to find the length of $BD$ and $DC$.\nThe Angle Bisector Theorem states that the ratio of the lengths of the two segments of the side $BC$ to the lengths of the two sides $AB$ and $AC$ are equal. Thus, $\\frac{BD}{DC} = \\frac{AB}{AC} = \\frac{13}{15}$. Let $BD = 13x$ and $DC = 15x$. Since $BD + DC = BC = 14$, we have $13x + 15x = 14$, which gives $28x = 14$, so $x = \\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, $BD = 13 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{13}{2}$ and $DC = 15 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{15}{2}$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the position of $E$ using the properties of the incircle.\nFor any triangle, the incircle is tangent to all three sides. The point $E$ is where the incircle is tangent to $BC$. The lengths of the segments $BE$ and $EC$ can be found using the formula related to the semiperimeter $s = \\frac{AB + BC + CA}{2} = \\frac{13 + 14 + 15}{2} = 21$. The formula states that $BE = s - AC = 21 - 15 = 6$ and $EC = s - AB = 21 - 13 = 8$.\n\n## Step 4: Find the length of $DE$ using the calculated positions of $D$ and $E$.\nTo find $DE$, we first need to determine the positions of $D$ and $E$ relative to $B$ and $C$. We have $BD = \\frac{13}{2} = 6.5$ and $BE = 6$. Thus, $DE = |BD - BE| = |6.5 - 6| = 0.5$.\n\n## Step 5: Verify the calculation and ensure it aligns with the geometric properties.\nSince $D$ and $E$ are both on $BC$, and we've calculated $BD$ and $BE$, the length of $DE$ is simply the absolute difference between $BD$ and $BE$. Our calculation is based on the properties of the angle bisector and the incircle, which are well-established geometric principles.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

The number of diagonals in an $n$-sided polygon can be calculated using the formula $D = \\frac{n(n-3)}{2}$, because from each vertex, there are potentially $n-3$ diagonals (excluding the edges of the polygon), and we divide by 2 to avoid counting each diagonal twice.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the coloring of the vertices\nSince each vertex is colored either red or blue, we can consider the distribution of these colors among the $n$ vertices. Let's denote the number of red vertices as $r$ and the number of blue vertices as $b$, with $r + b = n$.\n\n## Step 4: Examine the conditions for a diagonal to have the same colored endpoints\nFor a diagonal to have its endpoints colored the same, both endpoints must be either red or blue. We need to consider the possible distributions of red and blue vertices that would guarantee at least one such diagonal.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the Pigeonhole Principle\nTo prove that there exists a diagonal with endpoints of the same color, we can use the Pigeonhole Principle. This principle states that if $n$ items are put into $m$ containers, with $n > m$, then at least one container must contain more than one item. We can apply this principle to the vertices and their colors.\n\n## Step 6: Consider the diagonals emanating from a single vertex\nLet's consider a single vertex $V$. If $V$ is red, it can potentially connect to other red vertices via diagonals. There are $n-3$ other vertices that $V$ can connect to via diagonals. If more than half of the remaining $n-1$ vertices (excluding $V$ itself) are red, then there are at least $\\frac{n-1}{2}$ red vertices among them. However, we need to consider the distribution that guarantees a same-colored diagonal.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze the worst-case scenario for same-colored diagonals\nThe worst-case scenario for having a diagonal with the same color at both endpoints would be when the colors are as evenly distributed as possible among the vertices. However, given that $n \\geq 3$, we should examine if there's a configuration where no diagonal has the same colored endpoints.\n\n## Step 8: Prove the existence of a same-colored diagonal\nAssume that there is no diagonal with the same color at both endpoints. Consider three consecutive vertices $A$, $B$, and $C$. If $A$ and $C$ are the same color, then the diagonal $AC$ has the same color at its endpoints. The critical insight is to consider the distribution and connectivity.\n\n## Step 9: Simplify the argument using a direct approach\nLet's directly consider the vertices and their connections. If there are $n$ vertices, and they are colored red or blue, we can pick any vertex. Without loss of generality, let's say it's red. It connects to $n-3$ other vertices via diagonals. If any of these $n-3$ vertices are red, we have a diagonal with both endpoints red.\n\n## Step 10: Apply the Pigeonhole Principle to the problem\nConsider the $n$ vertices. If we have more than $\\frac{n}{2}$ vertices of one color (say red), then among the $n-3$ vertices connected by diagonals from any given red vertex, if there are at least 2 red vertices (which is likely given a significant number of red vertices), we can find a diagonal with red endpoints. However, the key is to show this holds under the constraint that vertices are colored red or blue.\n\n## Step 11: Finalize the proof\nLet's simplify: Consider a vertex $V$. It has $n-3$ diagonals. If $V$ is red and there are more than $\\frac{n-1}{2}$ other red vertices, or if $V$ is blue and there are more than $\\frac{n-1}{2}$ other blue vertices, then by the Pigeonhole Principle, at least one of these diagonals connects $V$ to a vertex of the same color. However, the condition that guarantees a same-colored diagonal is related to the overall distribution of colors.\n\n## Step 12: Direct Proof\nFor $n \\geq 3$, consider the vertices of $P$. Let's assume without loss of generality that there are at least as many red vertices as blue vertices (or vice versa).

Let $A = \\{(x, -x) | x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$ and $B = \\{(x, y) | x, y \\in \\mathbb{Q}, x + y = 0\\}$. However, a simpler example to consider is the space $X = \\mathbb{R}$ with the cofinite topology, where $A = \\{0\\}$ and $B = \\{1\\}$. Both are closed, disjoint, but there's no disjoint open sets containing them because any open set is the complement of a finite set, and thus, any two non-empty open sets intersect.\n\n## Step 8: State the conclusion based on the analysis\nThe given statement is not true for all topological spaces $X$. It is true if and only if $X$ is a normal space.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{False}$",

Since $Y = e^X$ and $X$ is a non-negative integer, $Y$ can take values $1, e, e^2, e^3, \\ldots$. For $Y = e^k$, $P(Y = e^k) = P(X = k)$ because $Y = e^k$ if and only if $X = k$.

Here, $\\{1,4\\}$ and $\\{2,3\\}$ are special.\n- Subsets with 3 elements: $\\{1,2,3\\}=6$, $\\{1,2,4\\}=7$, $\\{1,2,5\\}=8$, $\\{1,3,4\\}=8$, $\\{1,3,5\\}=9$, $\\{1,4,5\\}=10$, $\\{2,3,4\\}=9$, $\\{2,3,5\\}=10$, $\\{2,4,5\\}=11$, $\\{3,4,5\\}=12$. Here, $\\{1,4,5\\}$ and $\\{2,3,5\\}$ are special.\n- Subsets with 4 elements: $\\{1,2,3,4\\}=10$, $\\{1,2,3,5\\}=11$, $\\{1,2,4,5\\}=12$, $\\{1,3,4,5\\}=13$, $\\{2,3,4,5\\}=14$. Here, $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$ is special.\n- Subsets with 5 elements: $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}=15$, which is special.\n\n## Step 6: Count the special subsets.\nFrom Step 5, we identified the special subsets:\n- 2-element subsets: $\\{1,4\\}$ and $\\{2,3\\}$, so 2 subsets.\n- 3-element subsets: $\\{1,4,5\\}$ and $\\{2,3,5\\}$, so 2 subsets.\n- 4-element subsets: $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$, so 1 subset.\n- 5-element subsets: $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$, so 1 subset.\nThus, the total number of special subsets is $2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 6$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$",

        "answer": "## Step 1: Understand the problem statement\nThe problem asks us to prove that for any given prime number $p$, there are infinitely many positive integers $n$ such that $p$ divides $2^n - n$. This means we need to show that the congruence $2^n \\equiv n \\mod p$ has infinitely many solutions.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the properties of modular arithmetic\nTo tackle this problem, we should first understand the properties of modular arithmetic, especially with respect to prime numbers. For a prime $p$, we know that $\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}$ is a field, and Fermat's Little Theorem states that $a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\mod p$ for any integer $a$ not divisible by $p$.\n\n## Step 3: Apply Fermat's Little Theorem to simplify $2^n \\mod p$\nBy Fermat's Little Theorem, $2^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\mod p$ because $p$ is prime and $2$ is not divisible by $p$ (since $p$ is a prime number and $p > 2$ for $p$ to divide $2^n - n$ meaningfully for large $n$). This implies that $2^n \\mod p$ is periodic with a period that divides $p-1$.\n\n## Step 4: Examine the condition $2^n \\equiv n \\mod p$\nWe need to find $n$ such that $2^n \\equiv n \\mod p$. To simplify the problem, we can look for patterns or specific values of $n$ that satisfy this condition. Given the periodic nature of $2^n \\mod p$, we should consider how $n \\mod p$ behaves.\n\n## Step 5: Construct a sequence of $n$ that satisfies $2^n \\equiv n \\mod p$\nLet's consider $n = p + k(p-1)$ for some integer $k$. Then, $2^n = 2^{p + k(p-1)} = 2^p \\cdot (2^{p-1})^k$. By Fermat's Little Theorem, $2^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\mod p$, so $2^n \\equiv 2^p \\mod p$. We need $2^p \\equiv n \\mod p$, which simplifies to $2^p \\equiv p + k(p-1) \\mod p$, or $2^p \\equiv p \\mod p$ since $k(p-1) \\equiv 0 \\mod p$. This is always true because $p \\equiv 0 \\mod p$.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the condition further\nSince $2^p \\equiv 2^p \\mod p$, we actually need to directly check if $n = p + k(p-1)$ satisfies $2^n \\equiv n \\mod p$. For $k = 0$, $n = p$, and we have $2^p \\equiv p \\mod p$. We know $2^p \\equiv 2 \\mod p$ by Fermat's Little Theorem (since $2^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\mod p$ implies $2^p \\equiv 2 \\mod p$), so we are checking if $2 \\equiv p \\mod p$, which is not true. However, this step helps us understand that we need to directly examine the congruence for specific forms of $n$.\n\n## Step 7: Directly examine the congruence for $n = kp$ for some $k$\nFor $n = kp$, we have $2^{kp} \\equiv (2^p)^k \\equiv 2^k \\mod p$ by Fermat's Little Theorem. So, $2^{kp} \\equiv kp \\mod p$ simplifies to $2^k \\equiv kp \\mod p$, or $2^k \\equiv 0 \\mod p$ since $kp \\equiv 0 \\mod p$. This is not helpful as $2^k$ is never $0 \\mod p$.\n\n## Step 8: Reconsider the approach for finding $n$ such that $2^n \\equiv n \\mod p$\nLet's directly use the fact that $2^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\mod p$. For any $n = m(p-1) + r$ where $0 \\leq r < p-1$, $2^n \\equiv 2^r \\mod p$. So, we need $2^r \\equiv m(p-1) + r \\mod p$. For $r = 0$, this simplifies to $1 \\equiv m(p-1) \\mod p$, which is not possible for any $m$ because $m(p-1) \\equiv -m \\mod p$. We need to find a suitable $r$.\n\n## Step 9: Utilize a specific construction to prove infinitude\nConsider $n = (p-1)k$ for some $k$. Then, $2^n \\equiv 1 \\mod p$. We need $1 \\equiv (p-1)k \\mod p$, or $1 \\equiv -k \\mod p$. So, $k \\equiv -1 \\mod p$ gives a solution. Thus, $n = (p-1)(mp - 1)$ for any integer $m$ is a potential candidate because $2^{(p-1)(mp-1)} \\equiv 1 \\mod p$ and $(p-1)(mp-1) \\equiv -1(p-1) \\equiv 1 \\mod p$ is not what we need; instead, we directly check if $2^n \\equiv n \\mod p$ holds for $n = (p-1)(p-1)m + (p-1)$, which simplifies to checking $n = (p-1)^2m + (p-1)$.\n\n## Step 10: Verify the construction\nFor $n = (p-1)^2m + (p-1)$, we have $2^n \\equiv 2^{(p-1)} \\equiv 1 \\mod p$ because $2^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\mod p$. And $n \\mod p$ is equivalent to $(p-1) \\mod p$, which is $-1 \\mod p$. So, $2^n \\equiv 1 \\mod p$ and $n \\equiv -1 \\mod p$. We need to check if there's an $m$ for which $2^n \\equiv n \\mod p$ is satisfied. Let's directly check for a pattern or a specific $n$ that works.\n\n## Step 11: Simplify the problem by directly checking initial values and using properties of congruences\nLet's directly apply the condition and check for initial values of $n$ and see if a pattern emerges that can be generalized.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{There are infinitely many positive integers $n$ such that $p \\mid 2^n - n$}$",

This means we need to show that the congruence $2^n \\equiv n \\mod p$ has infinitely many solutions.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the properties of modular arithmetic and Fermat's Little Theorem\nFor a prime $p$, by Fermat's Little Theorem, $2^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\mod p$. This implies that the sequence $2^n \\mod p$ is periodic with a period dividing $p-1$.\n\n## Step 3: Examine the condition $2^n \\equiv n \\mod p$ using properties of congruences\nLet's consider $n = k(p-1) + r$ where $0 \\leq r < p-1$. Then, $2^n \\equiv 2^r \\mod p$. So, we need $2^r \\equiv k(p-1) + r \\mod p$. Simplifying, $2^r \\equiv -k + r \\mod p$ because $p-1 \\equiv -1 \\mod p$.\n\n## Step 4: Construct a specific $n$ that satisfies the condition for any prime $p$\nFor $r = 0$, we have $1 \\equiv -k \\mod p$, or $k \\equiv -1 \\mod p$. So, $k = mp - 1$ for some integer $m$. Thus, $n = (p-1)(mp-1)$.\n\n## Step 5: Verify the construction and show there are infinitely many $n$\nFor $n = (p-1)(mp-1)$, we have $2^n \\equiv 1 \\mod p$ and $n \\equiv -(p-1) \\equiv 1 \\mod p$. So, $2^n - n \\equiv 1 - 1 \\equiv 0 \\mod p$, which means $p \\mid 2^n - n$. As $m$ varies over the positive integers, we get infinitely many $n$ satisfying the condition.\n\n## Step 6: State the final result\nSince $m$ can take any positive integer value, there are infinitely many $n = (p-1)(mp-1)$ that satisfy $p \\mid 2^n - n$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{There are infinitely many positive integers $n$ such that $p \\mid 2^n - n$}$",
