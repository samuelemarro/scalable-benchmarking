We exclude the empty set, leaving us with $31$ non-empty subsets.\n\n### Step 3: Exclude Subsets with Fewer than Two Elements\n\nWe need to exclude subsets with fewer than two elements, i.e., the single-element subsets and the empty set.

We have:\n- $a^m = e$ and $b^n = e$.\n\nFrom $a^3 = b^2$, it follows that:\n- $a^{3k} = e$ implies $b^{2k} = e$ for some integer $k$.\n\nTo find a common order, consider the least common multiple of 3 and 2, which is 6. This suggests that both $a$ and $b$ could have order 6. Let's verify this:\n\n- If $a^6 = e$, then $b^4 = (a^3)^2 = e$, so $b$ could have order 6.\n- If $b^6 = e$, then $a^9 = (b^2)^3 = e$, so $a$ could have order 6.\n\nThus, it is consistent for both $a$ and $b$ to have order 6.\n\n**Step 2: Show $(ab)^6 = e$.**\n\nSince $a$ and $b$ commute, we have:\n$$(ab)^6 = (ab)(ab)(ab)(ab)(ab)(ab) = a^6b^6.$$\n\nGiven $a^6 = e$ and $b^6 = e$, it follows that:\n$$a^6b^6 = e \\cdot e = e.$$\n\nThus, $(ab)^6 = e$.\n\n**Step 3: Show that no smaller positive power of $ab$ equals $e$.**\n\nTo show that the order of $ab$ is exactly 6, we need to check that $(ab)^k \\neq e$ for $1 \\leq k < 6$.\n\n- For $k = 1$: $(ab)^1 = ab \\neq e$ since $a$ and $b$ are not inverses.\n- For $k = 2$: $(ab)^2 = a^2b^2$. Since $a^3 = b^2$, $a^2b^2 = a^2a^3 = a^5 \\neq e$.\n- For $k = 3$: $(ab)^3 = a^3b^3 = b^2b^3 = b^5 \\neq e$.\n- For $k = 4$: $(ab)^4 = a^4b^4$. Since $a^3 = b^2$, $a^4 = a^3a = b^2a$, so $a^4b^4 = b^2ab^4 = b^6a = a \\neq e$.\n- For $k = 5$: $(ab)^5 = a^5b^5$. Since $a^3 = b^2$, $a^5 = a^3a^2 = b^2a^2$, so $a^5b^5 = b^2a^2b^5 = b^7a^2 = b^6b^1a^2 = a^6b^1a^2 = a^2b \\neq e$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $(ab)^k = e$ is $k = 6$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe element $ab$ has order 6 in the group $G$. Thus, $ab$ is an element of order 6.",

Therefore, the equation of the tangent line at $P = (1, 0)$ is:\n\n   \\[\n   x = 1\n   \\]\n\nIn conclusion, the equation of the tangent line to the curve $y^2 = x^3 - 3x + 2$ at the point $P = (1, 0)$ is $x = 1$.",

This means there exists a partial isometry $v$ such that $v^*v = p \\oplus r$ and $vv^* = q \\oplus s$.\n\nThe map $\\phi$ is defined by $\\phi([p]) = [p \\otimes 1_X]$.

We have:\n- $p \\otimes 1_X \\oplus r \\otimes 1_X \\sim q \\otimes 1_X \\oplus s \\otimes 1_X$.\n\nThis is because the tensor product with $1_X$ preserves the Murray-von Neumann equivalence.

This means there exists a partial isometry $v$ such that $v^*v = p \\oplus r$ and $vv^* = q \\oplus s$.\n\nThe map $\\phi$ is defined by $\\phi([p]) = [p \\otimes 1_X]$.

We have:\n- $p \\otimes 1_X \\oplus r \\otimes 1_X \\sim q \\otimes 1_X \\oplus s \\otimes 1_X$.\n\nThis is because the tensor product with $1_X$ preserves the Murray-von Neumann equivalence.

Then:\n\n$$ \\int_{a}^{b} (mx + c) \\, dx = \\left[ \\frac{m}{2}x^2 + cx \\right]_{a}^{b} = \\left( \\frac{m}{2}b^2 + cb \\right) - \\left( \\frac{m}{2}a^2 + ca \\right). $$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$$ \\frac{m}{2}(b^2 - a^2) + c(b - a) = f(a) + f(b) = ma + c + mb + c. $$\n\nSimplifying the right-hand side:\n\n$$ ma + mb + 2c. $$\n\nEquating both sides:\n\n$$ \\frac{m}{2}(b^2 - a^2) + c(b - a) = ma + mb + 2c. $$\n\nThis must hold for all $a$ and $b$. By comparing coefficients, we find $m = 0$ and $c = 1$. Thus, $f(x) = 1$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe function $f(x) = 1$ satisfies the condition, and $f(0) = 1$ is consistent. Therefore, $f(1) = 1$.\n\nThe value of $f(1)$ is $\\boxed{1}$.",

This is known as the \"dyadic transformation\" or \"Bernoulli map.\"\n\n2. **Invariant Measure:**\n   The Lebesgue measure $\\mu$ on $[0, 1)$ is invariant under $T$. This means that for any measurable set $A \\subseteq [0, 1)$, we have $\\mu(T^{-1}(A)) = \\mu(A)$. This is because the transformation $T(x) = 2x \\mod 1$ essentially \"stretches\" the interval $[0, 1)$ by a factor of 2 and then wraps it back into $[0, 1)$, preserving the measure.\n\n3. **Mixing Property:**\n   To show ergodicity, it is often useful to demonstrate that the system is mixing.

For the dyadic transformation, the only sets that are invariant under $T$ are those with measure 0 or 1. This is a consequence of the mixing property, which implies ergodicity.\n\n5. **Formal Proof of Ergodicity:**\n   Suppose $A \\subseteq [0, 1)$ is an invariant set under $T$, meaning $T^{-1}(A) = A$.

The solutions to this equation are $\\mu(A) = 0$ or $\\mu(A) = 1$. Therefore, $A$ is either of full measure or zero measure, proving ergodicity.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   The dynamical system defined by $x_{n+1} = 2x_n \\mod 1$ is ergodic with respect to the Lebesgue measure on $[0, 1)$.

        "answer": "To prove that the Fourier transform $\\mathcal{F}(f)$ of a function $f: G \\to \\mathbb{C}$ is continuous on the dual group $\\widehat{G}$, we need to show that for every $\\xi_0 \\in \\widehat{G}$ and every $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $\\xi_0$ in $\\widehat{G}$ such that for all $\\xi \\in U$, we have $|\\mathcal{F}(f)(\\xi) - \\mathcal{F}(f)(\\xi_0)| < \\epsilon$.\n\n### Step-by-step Proof:\n\n1. **Definition of the Fourier Transform:**\n   The Fourier transform of $f$ at $\\xi \\in \\widehat{G}$ is given by:\n   $$ \\mathcal{F}(f)(\\xi) = \\int_{G} f(x) \\overline{\\chi(\\xi, x)} \\, dx = \\int_{G} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i \\langle \\xi, x \\rangle} \\, dx. $$\n\n2. **Continuity of $f$ and Compact Support:**\n   Since $f$ is continuous and has compact support, there exists a compact set $K \\subset G$ such that $f(x) = 0$ for all $x \\notin K$. This implies that the integral defining $\\mathcal{F}(f)(\\xi)$ is actually over the compact set $K$.\n\n3. **Uniform Continuity of $f$:**\n   Since $f$ is continuous on the compact set $K$, it is uniformly continuous on $K$. This means that for every $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\\delta > 0$ such that for all $x, y \\in K$, if $d(x, y) < \\delta$, then $|f(x) - f(y)| < \\epsilon$.\n\n4. **Continuity of Characters:**\n   The characters $\\chi(\\xi, x) = e^{2\\pi i \\langle \\xi, x \\rangle}$ are continuous in both $\\xi$ and $x$. For a fixed $x \\in G$, the map $\\xi \\mapsto \\chi(\\xi, x)$ is continuous on $\\widehat{G}$.\n\n5. **Continuity of the Fourier Transform:**\n   Fix $\\xi_0 \\in \\widehat{G}$ and let $\\epsilon > 0$.

The finite complement topology on an infinite set provides a counterexample where the statement does not hold. Therefore, the statement is not universally true for all topological spaces.\n\n**Final Answer**: The statement is false. Not all topological spaces are normal, and the existence of disjoint open sets for disjoint closed sets is not guaranteed in general.",

        "answer": "To find an approximate root of the equation $f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 2 = 0$ within the interval $[0, 2]$ using the bisection method with a tolerance of $0.01$, we proceed as follows:\n\n### Step 1: Verify the Intermediate Value Theorem Conditions\n\nFirst, we need to check that $f(x)$ changes sign over the interval $[0, 2]$. This ensures that there is at least one root in the interval.\n\nCalculate $f(0)$ and $f(2)$:\n\n- $f(0) = 0^3 - 3 \\cdot 0^2 + 4 \\cdot 0 - 2 = -2$.\n- $f(2) = 2^3 - 3 \\cdot 2^2 + 4 \\cdot 2 - 2 = 8 - 12 + 8 - 2 = 2$.\n\nSince $f(0) = -2 < 0$ and $f(2) = 2 > 0$, $f(x)$ changes sign over $[0, 2]$. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there is at least one root in this interval.\n\n### Step 2: Apply the Bisection Method\n\nThe bisection method involves the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the midpoint $c = \\frac{a + b}{2}$ of the interval $[a, b]$.\n2. Evaluate $f(c)$.\n3. Determine the subinterval $[a, c]$ or $[c, b]$ where the sign change occurs.\n4. Repeat the process on the new subinterval until the interval width is less than the tolerance.\n\nStart with $a = 0$ and $b = 2$.\n\n#### Iteration 1:\n- Midpoint: $c = \\frac{0 + 2}{2} = 1$.\n- Evaluate $f(1) = 1^3 - 3 \\cdot 1^2 + 4 \\cdot 1 - 2 = 1 - 3 + 4 - 2 = 0$.\n\nSince $f(1) = 0$, we have found an exact root at $x = 1$. However, to demonstrate the bisection method, let's assume $f(1)$ was not exactly zero and continue until the interval is sufficiently small.\n\n#### Iteration 2:\n- New interval: $[0, 1]$ (since $f(0) < 0$ and $f(1) = 0$).\n- Midpoint: $c = \\frac{0 + 1}{2} = 0.5$.\n- Evaluate $f(0.5) = (0.5)^3 - 3(0.5)^2 + 4(0.5) - 2 = 0.125 - 0.75 + 2 - 2 = -0.625$.\n\nSince $f(0.5) < 0$, the root is in $[0.5, 1]$.\n\n#### Iteration 3:\n- New interval: $[0.5, 1]$.\n- Midpoint: $c = \\frac{0.5 + 1}{2} = 0.75$.\n- Evaluate $f(0.75) = (0.75)^3 - 3(0.75)^2 + 4(0.75) - 2 = 0.421875 - 1.6875 + 3 - 2 = -0.265625$.\n\nSince $f(0.75) < 0$, the root is in $[0.75, 1]$.\n\n#### Iteration 4:\n- New interval: $[0.75, 1]$.\n- Midpoint: $c = \\frac{0.75 + 1}{2} = 0.875$.\n- Evaluate $f(0.875) = (0.875)^3 - 3(0.875)^2 + 4(0.875) - 2 = 0.669921875 - 2.296875 + 3.5 - 2 = -0.126953125$.\n\nSince $f(0.875) < 0$, the root is in $[0.875, 1]$.\n\n#### Iteration 5:\n- New interval: $[0.875, 1]$.\n- Midpoint: $c = \\frac{0.875 + 1}{2} = 0.9375$.\n- Evaluate $f(0.9375) = (0.9375)^3 -

        "raw_answer": "To find an approximate root of the equation $f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 2 = 0$ within the interval $[0, 2]$ using the bisection method with a tolerance of $0.01$, we proceed as follows:\n\n### Step 1: Verify the Intermediate Value Theorem Conditions\n\nFirst, we need to check that $f(x)$ changes sign over the interval $[0, 2]$. This ensures that there is at least one root in the interval.\n\nCalculate $f(0)$ and $f(2)$:\n\n- $f(0) = 0^3 - 3 \\cdot 0^2 + 4 \\cdot 0 - 2 = -2$.\n- $f(2) = 2^3 - 3 \\cdot 2^2 + 4 \\cdot 2 - 2 = 8 - 12 + 8 - 2 = 2$.\n\nSince $f(0) = -2 < 0$ and $f(2) = 2 > 0$, $f(x)$ changes sign over $[0, 2]$. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there is at least one root in this interval.\n\n### Step 2: Apply the Bisection Method\n\nThe bisection method involves the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the midpoint $c = \\frac{a + b}{2}$ of the interval $[a, b]$.\n2. Evaluate $f(c)$.\n3. Determine the subinterval $[a, c]$ or $[c, b]$ where the sign change occurs.\n4. Repeat the process on the new subinterval until the interval width is less than the tolerance.\n\nStart with $a = 0$ and $b = 2$.\n\n#### Iteration 1:\n- Midpoint: $c = \\frac{0 + 2}{2} = 1$.\n- Evaluate $f(1) = 1^3 - 3 \\cdot 1^2 + 4 \\cdot 1 - 2 = 1 - 3 + 4 - 2 = 0$.\n\nSince $f(1) = 0$, we have found an exact root at $x = 1$. However, to demonstrate the bisection method, let's assume $f(1)$ was not exactly zero and continue until the interval is sufficiently small.\n\n#### Iteration 2:\n- New interval: $[0, 1]$ (since $f(0) < 0$ and $f(1) = 0$).\n- Midpoint: $c = \\frac{0 + 1}{2} = 0.5$.\n- Evaluate $f(0.5) = (0.5)^3 - 3(0.5)^2 + 4(0.5) - 2 = 0.125 - 0.75 + 2 - 2 = -0.625$.\n\nSince $f(0.5) < 0$, the root is in $[0.5, 1]$.\n\n#### Iteration 3:\n- New interval: $[0.5, 1]$.\n- Midpoint: $c = \\frac{0.5 + 1}{2} = 0.75$.\n- Evaluate $f(0.75) = (0.75)^3 -

        "answer": "To find an approximate root of the equation $f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 2 = 0$ within the interval $[0, 2]$ using the bisection method with a tolerance of $0.01$, we proceed as follows:\n\n### Step 1: Verify the Intermediate Value Theorem Conditions\n\nFirst, we need to check that $f(x)$ changes sign over the interval $[0, 2]$. This ensures that there is at least one root in the interval.\n\nCalculate $f(0)$ and $f(2)$:\n\n- $f(0) = 0^3 - 3 \\cdot 0^2 + 4 \\cdot 0 - 2 = -2$.\n- $f(2) = 2^3 - 3 \\cdot 2^2 + 4 \\cdot 2 - 2 = 8 - 12 + 8 - 2 = 2$.\n\nSince $f(0) = -2 < 0$ and $f(2) = 2 > 0$, $f(x)$ changes sign over $[0, 2]$. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there is at least one root in this interval.\n\n### Step 2: Apply the Bisection Method\n\nThe bisection method involves the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the midpoint $c = \\frac{a + b}{2}$ of the interval $[a, b]$.\n2. Evaluate $f(c)$.\n3. Determine the subinterval $[a, c]$ or $[c, b]$ where the sign change occurs.\n4. Repeat the process on the new subinterval until the interval width is less than the tolerance.\n\nStart with $a = 0$ and $b = 2$.\n\n#### Iteration 1:\n- Midpoint: $c = \\frac{0 + 2}{2} = 1$.\n- Evaluate $f(1) = 1^3 - 3 \\cdot 1^2 + 4 \\cdot 1 - 2 = 0$.\n\nSince $f(1) = 0$, we have found an exact root at $x = 1$. However, to demonstrate the bisection method, let's assume $f(1)$ was not exactly zero and continue until the interval is sufficiently small.\n\n#### Iteration 2:\n- New interval: $[0, 1]$ (since $f(0) < 0$ and $f(1) = 0$).\n- Midpoint: $c = \\frac{0 + 1}{2} = 0.5$.\n- Evaluate $f(0.5) = (0.5)^3 - 3(0.5)^2 + 4(0.5) - 2 = -0.625$.\n\nSince $f(0.5) < 0$, the root is in $[0.5, 1]$.\n\n#### Iteration 3:\n- New interval: $[0.5, 1]$.\n- Midpoint: $c = \\frac{0.5 + 1}{2} = 0.75$.\n- Evaluate $f(0.75) = (0.75)^3 -

3(0.9375)^2 + 4(0.9375) - 2 = -0.062744140625$.\n\nSince $f(0.9375) < 0$, the root is in $[0.9375, 1]$.\n\n#### Iteration 6:\n- New interval: $[0.9375, 1]$.\n- Midpoint: $c = \\frac{0.9375 + 1}{2} = 0.96875$.\n- Evaluate $f(0.96875) = (0.96875)^3 -

        "raw_answer": "To find an approximate root of the equation $f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 2 = 0$ within the interval $[0, 2]$ using the bisection method with a tolerance of $0.01$, we proceed as follows:\n\n### Step 1: Verify the Intermediate Value Theorem Conditions\n\nFirst, we need to check that $f(x)$ changes sign over the interval $[0, 2]$. This ensures that there is at least one root in the interval.\n\nCalculate $f(0)$ and $f(2)$:\n\n- $f(0) = 0^3 - 3 \\cdot 0^2 + 4 \\cdot 0 - 2 = -2$.\n- $f(2) = 2^3 - 3 \\cdot 2^2 + 4 \\cdot 2 - 2 = 8 - 12 + 8 - 2 = 2$.\n\nSince $f(0) = -2 < 0$ and $f(2) = 2 > 0$, $f(x)$ changes sign over $[0, 2]$. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there is at least one root in this interval.\n\n### Step 2: Apply the Bisection Method\n\nThe bisection method involves the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the midpoint $c = \\frac{a + b}{2}$ of the interval $[a, b]$.\n2. Evaluate $f(c)$.\n3. Determine the subinterval $[a, c]$ or $[c, b]$ where the sign change occurs.\n4. Repeat the process on the new subinterval until the interval width is less than the tolerance.\n\nStart with $a = 0$ and $b = 2$.\n\n#### Iteration 1:\n- Midpoint: $c = \\frac{0 + 2}{2} = 1$.\n- Evaluate $f(1) = 1^3 - 3 \\cdot 1^2 + 4 \\cdot 1 - 2 = 0$.\n\nSince $f(1) = 0$, we have found an exact root at $x = 1$. However, to demonstrate the bisection method, let's assume $f(1)$ was not exactly zero and continue until the interval is sufficiently small.\n\n#### Iteration 2:\n- New interval: $[0, 1]$ (since $f(0) < 0$ and $f(1) = 0$).\n- Midpoint: $c = \\frac{0 + 1}{2} = 0.5$.\n- Evaluate $f(0.5) = (0.5)^3 -

        "answer": "To find an approximate root of the equation $f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 2 = 0$ within the interval $[0, 2]$ using the bisection method with a tolerance of $0.01$, we proceed as follows:\n\n### Step 1: Verify the Intermediate Value Theorem Conditions\n\nFirst, we need to check that $f(x)$ changes sign over the interval $[0, 2]$. This ensures that there is at least one root in the interval.\n\nCalculate $f(0)$ and $f(2)$:\n\n- $f(0) = 0^3 - 3 \\cdot 0^2 + 4 \\cdot 0 - 2 = -2$.\n- $f(2) = 2^3 - 3 \\cdot 2^2 + 4 \\cdot 2 - 2 = 8 - 12 + 8 - 2 = 2$.\n\nSince $f(0) = -2 < 0$ and $f(2) = 2 > 0$, $f(x)$ changes sign over $[0, 2]$. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there is at least one root in this interval.\n\n### Step 2: Apply the Bisection Method\n\nThe bisection method involves the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the midpoint $c = \\frac{a + b}{2}$ of the interval $[a, b]$.\n2. Evaluate $f(c)$.\n3. Determine the subinterval $[a, c]$ or $[c, b]$ where the sign change occurs.\n4. Repeat the process on the new subinterval until the interval width is less than the tolerance.\n\nStart with $a = 0$ and $b = 2$.\n\n#### Iteration 1:\n- Midpoint: $c = \\frac{0 + 2}{2} = 1$.\n- Evaluate $f(1) = 1^3 - 3 \\cdot 1^2 + 4 \\cdot 1 - 2 = 0$.\n\nSince $f(1) = 0$, we have found an exact root at $x = 1$. The bisection method can be concluded here, as we have found a root within the given interval.\n\nHowever, if we were to continue for demonstration purposes, we would proceed as follows:\n\n#### Iteration 2:\n- New interval: $[0, 1]$ (since $f(0) < 0$ and $f(1) = 0$).\n- Midpoint: $c = \\frac{0 + 1}{2} = 0.5$.\n- Evaluate $f(0.5) = (0.5)^3 - 3(0.5)^2 + 4(0.5) - 2 = -0.625$.\n\nSince $f(0.5) < 0$, the root is in $[0.5, 1]$.\n\n#### Iteration 3:\n- New interval: $[0.5, 1]$.\n- Midpoint: $c = \\frac{0.5 + 1}{2} = 0.75$.\n- Evaluate $f(0.75) = (0.75)^3 -

        "raw_answer": "To find an approximate root of the equation $f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 2 = 0$ within the interval $[0, 2]$ using the bisection method with a tolerance of $0.01$, we proceed as follows:\n\n### Step 1: Verify the Intermediate Value Theorem Conditions\n\nFirst, we need to check that $f(x)$ changes sign over the interval $[0, 2]$. This ensures that there is at least one root in the interval.\n\nCalculate $f(0)$ and $f(2)$:\n\n- $f(0) = 0^3 - 3 \\cdot 0^2 + 4 \\cdot 0 - 2 = -2$.\n- $f(2) = 2^3 - 3 \\cdot 2^2 + 4 \\cdot 2 - 2 = 8 - 12 + 8 - 2 = 2$.\n\nSince $f(0) = -2 < 0$ and $f(2) = 2 > 0$, $f(x)$ changes sign over $[0, 2]$. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there is at least one root in this interval.\n\n### Step 2: Apply the Bisection Method\n\nThe bisection method involves the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the midpoint $c = \\frac{a + b}{2}$ of the interval $[a, b]$.\n2. Evaluate $f(c)$.\n3. Determine the subinterval $[a, c]$ or $[c, b]$ where the sign change occurs.\n4. Repeat the process on the new subinterval until the interval width is less than the tolerance.\n\nStart with $a = 0$ and $b = 2$.\n\n#### Iteration 1:\n- Midpoint: $c = \\frac{0 + 2}{2} = 1$.\n- Evaluate $f(1) = 1^3 - 3 \\cdot 1^2 + 4 \\cdot 1 - 2 = 0$.\n\nSince $f(1) = 0$, we have found an exact root at $x = 1$. The bisection method can be concluded here, as we have found a root within the given interval.\n\nHowever, if we were to continue for demonstration purposes, we would proceed as follows:\n\n#### Iteration 2:\n- New interval: $[0, 1]$ (since $f(0) < 0$ and $f(1) = 0$).\n- Midpoint: $c = \\frac{0 + 1}{2} = 0.5$.\n- Evaluate $f(0.5) = (0.5)^3 - 3(0.5)^2 + 4(0.5) - 2 = -0.625$.\n\nSince $f(0.5) < 0$, the root is in $[0.5, 1]$.\n\n#### Iteration 3:\n- New interval: $[0.5, 1]$.\n- Midpoint: $c = \\frac{0.5 + 1}{2} = 0.75$.\n- Evaluate $f(0.75) = (0.75)^3 - 3(0.75)^2 + 4(0.75) - 2 = -0.265625$.\n\nSince $f(0.75) < 0$, the root is in $[0.75, 1]$.\n\n#### Iteration 4:\n- New interval: $[0.75, 1]$.\n- Midpoint: $c = \\frac{0.75 + 1}{2} = 0.875$.\n- Evaluate $f(0.875) = (0.875)^3 -

3(0.9375)^2 + 4(0.9375) - 2 = -0.062744140625$.\n\nSince $f(0.9375) < 0$, the root is in $[0.9375, 1]$.\n\n#### Iteration 6:\n- New interval: $[0.9375, 1]$.\n- Midpoint: $c = \\frac{0.9375 + 1}{2} = 0.96875$.\n- Evaluate $f(0.96875) = (0.96875)^3 -

        "answer": "To find an approximate root of the equation $f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 2 = 0$ within the interval $[0, 2]$ using the bisection method with a tolerance of $0.01$, we proceed as follows:\n\n### Step 1: Verify the Intermediate Value Theorem Conditions\n\nFirst, we need to check that $f(x)$ changes sign over the interval $[0, 2]$. This ensures that there is at least one root in the interval.\n\nCalculate $f(0)$ and $f(2)$:\n\n- $f(0) = 0^3 - 3 \\cdot 0^2 + 4 \\cdot 0 - 2 = -2$.\n- $f(2) = 2^3 - 3 \\cdot 2^2 + 4 \\cdot 2 - 2 = 8 - 12 + 8 - 2 = 2$.\n\nSince $f(0) = -2 < 0$ and $f(2) = 2 > 0$, $f(x)$ changes sign over $[0, 2]$. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there is at least one root in this interval.\n\n### Step 2: Apply the Bisection Method\n\nThe bisection method involves the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the midpoint $c = \\frac{a + b}{2}$ of the interval $[a, b]$.\n2. Evaluate $f(c)$.\n3. Determine the subinterval $[a, c]$ or $[c, b]$ where the sign change occurs.\n4. Repeat the process on the new subinterval until the interval width is less than the tolerance.\n\nStart with $a = 0$ and $b = 2$.\n\n#### Iteration 1:\n- Midpoint: $c = \\frac{0 + 2}{2} = 1$.\n- Evaluate $f(1) = 1^3 - 3 \\cdot 1^2 + 4 \\cdot 1 - 2 = 0$.\n\nSince $f(1) = 0$, we have found an exact root at $x = 1$. The bisection method can be concluded here, as we have found a root within the given interval.\n\nIf we were to continue for demonstration purposes, we would proceed as follows:\n\n#### Iteration 2:\n- New interval: $[0, 1]$ (since $f(0) < 0$ and $f(1) = 0$).\n- Midpoint: $c = \\frac{0 + 1}{2} = 0.5$.\n- Evaluate $f(0.5) = (0.5)^3 - 3(0.5)^2 + 4(0.5) - 2 = -0.625$.\n\nSince $f(0.5) < 0$, the root is in $[0.5, 1]$.\n\n#### Iteration 3:\n- New interval: $[0.5, 1]$.\n- Midpoint: $c = \\frac{0.5 + 1}{2} = 0.75$.\n- Evaluate $f(0.75) = (0.75)^3 -

3(0.9375)^2 + 4(0.9375) - 2 = -0.062744140625$.\n\nSince $f(0.9375) < 0$, the root is in $[0.9375, 1]$.\n\n#### Iteration 6:\n- New interval: $[0.9375, 1]$.\n- Midpoint: $c = \\frac{0.9375 + 1}{2} = 0.96875$.\n- Evaluate $f(0.96875) = (0.96875)^3 -

        "raw_answer": "To find an approximate root of the equation $f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 2 = 0$ within the interval $[0, 2]$ using the bisection method with a tolerance of $0.01$, we proceed as follows:\n\n### Step 1: Verify the Intermediate Value Theorem Conditions\n\nFirst, we need to check that $f(x)$ changes sign over the interval $[0, 2]$. This ensures that there is at least one root in the interval.\n\nCalculate $f(0)$ and $f(2)$:\n\n- $f(0) = 0^3 - 3 \\cdot 0^2 + 4 \\cdot 0 - 2 = -2$.\n- $f(2) = 2^3 - 3 \\cdot 2^2 + 4 \\cdot 2 - 2 = 8 - 12 + 8 - 2 = 2$.\n\nSince $f(0) = -2 < 0$ and $f(2) = 2 > 0$, $f(x)$ changes sign over $[0, 2]$. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there is at least one root in this interval.\n\n### Step 2: Apply the Bisection Method\n\nThe bisection method involves the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the midpoint $c = \\frac{a + b}{2}$ of the interval $[a, b]$.\n2. Evaluate $f(c)$.\n3. Determine the subinterval $[a, c]$ or $[c, b]$ where the sign change occurs.\n4. Repeat the process on the new subinterval until the interval width is less than the tolerance.\n\nStart with $a = 0$ and $b = 2$.\n\n#### Iteration 1:\n- Midpoint: $c = \\frac{0 + 2}{2} = 1$.\n- Evaluate $f(1) = 1^3 - 3 \\cdot 1^2 + 4 \\cdot 1 - 2 = 0$.\n\nSince $f(1) = 0$, we have found an exact root at $x = 1$. The bisection method can be concluded here, as we have found a root within the given interval.\n\nIf we were to continue for demonstration purposes, we would proceed as follows:\n\n#### Iteration 2:\n- New interval: $[0, 1]$ (since $f(0) < 0$ and $f(1) = 0$).\n- Midpoint: $c = \\frac{0 + 1}{2} = 0.5$.\n- Evaluate $f(0.5) = (0.5)^3 - 3(0.5)^2 + 4(0.5) - 2 = -0.625$.\n\nSince $f(0.5) < 0$, the root is in $[0.5, 1]$.\n\n#### Iteration 3:\n- New interval: $[0.5, 1]$.\n- Midpoint: $c = \\frac{0.5 + 1}{2} = 0.75$.\n- Evaluate $f(0.75) = (0.75)^3 - 3(0.75)^2 + 4(0.75) - 2 = -0.265625$.\n\nSince $f(0.75) < 0$, the root is in $[0.75, 1]$.\n\n#### Iteration 4:\n- New interval: $[0.75, 1]$.\n- Midpoint: $c = \\frac{0.75 + 1}{2} = 0.875$.\n- Evaluate $f(0.875) = (0.875)^3 - 3(0.875)^2 + 4(0.875) - 2 = -0.126953125$.\n\nSince $f(0.875) < 0$, the root is in $[0.875, 1]$.\n\n#### Iteration 5:\n- New interval: $[0.875, 1]$.\n- Midpoint: $c = \\frac{0.875 + 1}{2} = 0.9375$.\n- Evaluate $f(0.9375) = (0.9375)^3 - 3(0.9375)^2 + 4(0.9375) - 2 = -0.062744140625$.\n\nSince $f(0.9375) < 0$, the root is in $[0.9375, 1]$.\n\n#### Iteration 6:\n- New interval: $[0.9375, 1]$.\n- Midpoint: $c = \\frac{0.9375 + 1}{2} = 0.96875$.\n- Evaluate $f(0.96875) = (0.96875)^3 -

        "answer": "To find an approximate root of the equation $f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 2 = 0$ within the interval $[0, 2]$ using the bisection method with a tolerance of $0.01$, we proceed as follows:\n\n### Step 1: Verify the Intermediate Value Theorem Conditions\n\nFirst, we need to check that $f(x)$ changes sign over the interval $[0, 2]$. This ensures that there is at least one root in the interval.\n\nCalculate $f(0)$ and $f(2)$:\n\n- $f(0) = 0^3 - 3 \\cdot 0^2 + 4 \\cdot 0 - 2 = -2$.\n- $f(2) = 2^3 - 3 \\cdot 2^2 + 4 \\cdot 2 - 2 = 8 - 12 + 8 - 2 = 2$.\n\nSince $f(0) = -2 < 0$ and $f(2) = 2 > 0$, $f(x)$ changes sign over $[0, 2]$. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there is at least one root in this interval.\n\n### Step 2: Apply the Bisection Method\n\nThe bisection method involves the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the midpoint $c = \\frac{a + b}{2}$ of the interval $[a, b]$.\n2. Evaluate $f(c)$.\n3. Determine the subinterval $[a, c]$ or $[c, b]$ where the sign change occurs.\n4. Repeat the process on the new subinterval until the interval width is less than the tolerance.\n\nStart with $a = 0$ and $b = 2$.\n\n#### Iteration 1:\n- Midpoint: $c = \\frac{0 + 2}{2} = 1$.\n- Evaluate $f(1) = 1^3 - 3 \\cdot 1^2 + 4 \\cdot 1 - 2 = 0$.\n\nSince $f(1) = 0$, we have found an exact root at $x = 1$. However, for demonstration purposes, let's continue to find an approximate root with the given tolerance.\n\n#### Iteration 2:\n- New interval: $[0, 1]$ (since $f(0) < 0$ and $f(1) = 0$).\n- Midpoint: $c = \\frac{0 + 1}{2} = 0.5$.\n- Evaluate $f(0.5) = (0.5)^3 - 3(0.5)^2 + 4(0.5) - 2 = -0.625$.\n\nSince $f(0.5) < 0$, the root is in $[0.5, 1]$.\n\n#### Iteration 3:\n- New interval: $[0.5, 1]$.\n- Midpoint: $c = \\frac{0.5 + 1}{2} = 0.75$.\n- Evaluate $f(0.75) = (0.75)^3 - 3(0.75)^2 + 4(0.75) - 2 = -0.265625$.\n\nSince $f(0.75) < 0$, the root is in $[0.75, 1]$.\n\n#### Iteration 4:\n- New interval: $[0.75, 1]$.\n- Midpoint: $c = \\frac{0.75 + 1}{2} = 0.875$.\n- Evaluate $f(0.875) = (0.875)^3 - 3(0.875)^2 + 4(0.875) - 2 = -0.126953125$.\n\nSince $f(0.875) < 0$, the root is in $[0.875, 1]$.\n\n#### Iteration 5:\n- New interval: $[0.875, 1]$.\n- Midpoint: $c = \\frac{0.875 + 1}{2} = 0.9375$.\n- Evaluate $f(0.9375) = (0.9375)^3 - 3(0.9375)^2 + 4(0.9375) - 2 = -0.062744140625$.\n\nSince $f(0.9375) < 0$, the root is in $[0.9375, 1]$.\n\n#### Iteration 6:\n- New interval: $[0.9375, 1]$.\n- Midpoint: $c = \\frac{0.9375 + 1}{2} = 0.96875$.\n- Evaluate $f(0.96875) = (0.96875)^3 -

        "raw_answer": "To find an approximate root of the equation $f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 2 = 0$ within the interval $[0, 2]$ using the bisection method with a tolerance of $0.01$, we proceed as follows:\n\n### Step 1: Verify the Intermediate Value Theorem Conditions\n\nFirst, we need to check that $f(x)$ changes sign over the interval $[0, 2]$. This ensures that there is at least one root in the interval.\n\nCalculate $f(0)$ and $f(2)$:\n\n- $f(0) = 0^3 - 3 \\cdot 0^2 + 4 \\cdot 0 - 2 = -2$.\n- $f(2) = 2^3 - 3 \\cdot 2^2 + 4 \\cdot 2 - 2 = 8 - 12 + 8 - 2 = 2$.\n\nSince $f(0) = -2 < 0$ and $f(2) = 2 > 0$, $f(x)$ changes sign over $[0, 2]$. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there is at least one root in this interval.\n\n### Step 2: Apply the Bisection Method\n\nThe bisection method involves the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the midpoint $c = \\frac{a + b}{2}$ of the interval $[a, b]$.\n2. Evaluate $f(c)$.\n3. Determine the subinterval $[a, c]$ or $[c, b]$ where the sign change occurs.\n4. Repeat the process on the new subinterval until the interval width is less than the tolerance.\n\nStart with $a = 0$ and $b = 2$.\n\n#### Iteration 1:\n- Midpoint: $c = \\frac{0 + 2}{2} = 1$.\n- Evaluate $f(1) = 1^3 - 3 \\cdot 1^2 + 4 \\cdot 1 - 2 = 0$.\n\nSince $f(1) = 0$, we have found an exact root at $x = 1$. However, for demonstration purposes, let's continue to find an approximate root with the given tolerance.\n\n#### Iteration 2:\n- New interval: $[0, 1]$ (since $f(0) < 0$ and $f(1) = 0$).\n- Midpoint: $c = \\frac{0 + 1}{2} = 0.5$.\n- Evaluate $f(0.5) = (0.5)^3 - 3(0.5)^2 + 4(0.5) - 2 = -0.625$.\n\nSince $f(0.5) < 0$, the root is in $[0.5, 1]$.\n\n#### Iteration 3:\n- New interval: $[0.5, 1]$.\n- Midpoint: $c = \\frac{0.5 + 1}{2} = 0.75$.\n- Evaluate $f(0.75) = (0.75)^3 - 3(0.75)^2 + 4(0.75) - 2 = -0.265625$.\n\nSince $f(0.75) < 0$, the root is in $[0.75, 1]$.\n\n#### Iteration 4:\n- New interval: $[0.75, 1]$.\n- Midpoint: $c = \\frac{0.75 + 1}{2} = 0.875$.\n- Evaluate $f(0.875) = (0.875)^3 - 3(0.875)^2 + 4(0.875) - 2 = -0.126953125$.\n\nSince $f(0.875) < 0$, the root is in $[0.875, 1]$.\n\n#### Iteration 5:\n- New interval: $[0.875, 1]$.\n- Midpoint: $c = \\frac{0.875 + 1}{2} = 0.9375$.\n- Evaluate $f(0.9375) = (0.9375)^3 -

        "answer": "To determine the radical $\\sqrt{I}$ of the ideal $I = \\langle x^2 - 4 \\rangle$ in the ring $R = \\mathbb{Z}[x]$, we need to find all polynomials $f(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$ such that there exists a positive integer $n$ with $f(x)^n \\in I$. This means $f(x)^n$ must be a multiple of $x^2 - 4$.\n\nFirst, note that $x^2 - 4$ can be factored as $(x-2)(x+2)$. Therefore, $I = \\langle x^2 - 4 \\rangle = \\langle (x-2)(x+2) \\rangle$.\n\nThe radical $\\sqrt{I}$ consists of all polynomials $f(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$ such that $f(x)^n \\in \\langle (x-2)(x+2) \\rangle$ for some positive integer $n$. This implies that $f(x)^n$ must vanish at both $x = 2$ and $x = -2$, because if $f(x)^n$ is a multiple of $(x-2)(x+2)$, then $f(x)^n$ must have both $x-2$ and $x+2$ as factors.\n\nThus, $f(x)$ itself must vanish at $x = 2$ and $x = -2$. Therefore, $f(x)$ must be a multiple of $(x-2)(x+2)$. This means $f(x) \\in \\langle x-2, x+2 \\rangle$.\n\nHowever, in the context of $\\mathbb{Z}[x]$, the ideal generated by $x-2$ and $x+2$ is not the same as the ideal generated by their product $(x-2)(x+2) = x^2 - 4$. Instead, we need to consider the polynomials that vanish at both $x = 2$ and $x = -2$.\n\nThe polynomials that vanish at both $x = 2$ and $x = -2$ are precisely those that are multiples of $(x-2)(x+2)$. Therefore, $\\sqrt{I} = \\langle x-2, x+2 \\rangle$.\n\nTo verify, consider any $f(x) \\in \\sqrt{I}$. Then $f(x)^n \\in \\langle x^2 - 4 \\rangle$ for some $n$, meaning $f(x)^n = (x^2 - 4)g(x)$ for some $g(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$. This implies $f(x)$ must have both $x-2$ and $x+2$ as roots, so $f(x)$ is a multiple of $(x-2)(x+2)$.\n\nThus, the radical of the ideal $I = \\langle x^2 - 4 \\rangle$ in $\\mathbb{Z}[x]$ is:\n\n$$\n\\sqrt{I} = \\langle x-2, x+2 \\rangle\n$$",

Therefore, $I = \\langle x^2 - 4 \\rangle = \\langle (x-2)(x+2) \\rangle$.\n\nThe radical $\\sqrt{I}$ consists of all polynomials $f(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$ such that $f(x)^n \\in \\langle (x-2)(x+2) \\rangle$ for some positive integer $n$. This implies that $f(x)^n$ must vanish at both $x = 2$ and $x = -2$, because if $f(x)^n$ is a multiple of $(x-2)(x+2)$, then $f(x)^n$ must have both $x-2$ and $x+2$ as factors.\n\nThus, $f(x)$ itself must vanish at $x = 2$ and $x = -2$. Therefore, $f(x)$ must be a multiple of $(x-2)(x+2)$. This means $f(x) \\in \\langle x-2, x+2 \\rangle$.\n\nHowever, in the context of $\\mathbb{Z}[x]$, the ideal generated by $x-2$ and $x+2$ is not the same as the ideal generated by their product $(x-2)(x+2) = x^2 - 4$. Instead, we need to consider the polynomials that vanish at both $x = 2$ and $x = -2$.\n\nThe polynomials that vanish at both $x = 2$ and $x = -2$ are precisely those that are multiples of $(x-2)(x+2)$. Therefore, $\\sqrt{I} = \\langle x-2, x+2 \\rangle$.\n\nTo verify, consider any $f(x) \\in \\sqrt{I}$. Then $f(x)^n \\in \\langle x^2 - 4 \\rangle$ for some $n$, meaning $f(x)^n = (x^2 - 4)g(x)$ for some $g(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$. This implies $f(x)$ must have both $x-2$ and $x+2$ as roots, so $f(x)$ is a multiple of $(x-2)(x+2)$.\n\nThus, the radical of the ideal $I = \\langle x^2 - 4 \\rangle$ in $\\mathbb{Z}[x]$ is:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{I} = \\langle x-2, x+2 \\rangle\n\\]",
