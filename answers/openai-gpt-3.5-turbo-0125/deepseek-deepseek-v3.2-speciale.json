Specifically, it does not require that $a^3 = e$ and $b^2 = e$, nor does it impose any finiteness condition on the orders of $a$ and $b$. The relation $a^3 = b^2$ only states that two particular powers coincide; it does not force those powers to be the identity, and it does not restrict the possible orders of $a$ and $b$.\n\n### Counterexample 1 (infinite group)\n\nLet $G = \\mathbb{Z}$ (the additive group of integers). Choose $a = 2$ and $b = 3$. Then\n- $ab = a+b = 2+3 = 5$ (written additively, so commutativity is automatic).\n- $a^3 = 3a = 6$ and $b^2 = 2b = 6$, so $a^3 = b^2$.\nThus the hypotheses hold, but $ab = 5$ has infinite order (since no positive integer $k$ gives $k\\cdot5 = 0$). In particular, it does **not** have order $6$.\n\n### Counterexample 2 (finite group)\n\nLet $G = C_7 = \\langle h \\mid h^7 = e \\rangle$, a cyclic group of order $7$. Define\n$$\na = h^3,\\qquad b = h.\n$$\nThen\n- $ab = h^3 h = h^4$ (and $ba = h h^3 = h^4$), so $ab = ba$.\n- $a^3 = (h^3)^3 = h^9 = h^2$ (since $9 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$).\n- $b^2 = h^2$.\nHence $a^3 = b^2$. The element $ab = h^4$ has order $7$ because $7$ is prime and $4 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$. In particular, $(ab)^6 = h^{24} = h^{3} \\neq e$, so the order of $ab$ is not $6$.\n\nThese counterexamples demonstrate that the conclusion does **not** follow from the given premises.\n\n### What is missing?\n\nTo obtain the conclusion that $ab$ has order $6$, one typically needs the stronger assumptions that **$a$ has order $3$ and $b$ has order $2$** (or at least $a^3 = e$, $b^2 = e$, and $a,b \\neq e$). Under those additional hypotheses, the standard result holds:\n- Because $a$ and $b$ commute, $(ab)^6 = a^6 b^6 = (a^3)^2 (b^2)^3 = e$.\n- One can then show that no smaller positive exponent yields $e$ provided $a$ and $b$ are non\u2011identity and have exactly those orders.\n\nThus, a well\u2011posed version of the question would be:\n\n> Let $G$ be a group with identity $e$.

The canonical map $\\iota_A\\colon V(A)\\to K_0(A)$ sends a class $[p]$ to its image in the group; by slight abuse we denote that image also by $[p]$.\n\n* **$K(X,A)$.**  \n  $C(X)$ is the unital commutative $C^*$-algebra of continuous functions on $X$.

Because $(p\\otimes 1_X)^*=p^*\\otimes 1_X=p\\otimes 1_X$ and $(p\\otimes 1_X)^2=p^2\\otimes 1_X=p\\otimes 1_X$, it is a projection.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Construction of $\\phi$ via a semigroup homomorphism\n\nWe first define a map on the semigroup level:\n\n$$\n\\psi\\colon V(A)\\longrightarrow V(C(X)\\otimes A),\\qquad \\psi([p])=[p\\otimes 1_X].\n$$\n\nWe will show that $\\psi$ is a well-defined semigroup homomorphism. Then, because $K(X,A)$ is an abelian group, the universal property of the Grothendieck group yields a unique group homomorphism $\\phi\\colon K_0(A)\\to K(X,A)$ satisfying $\\phi([p])=\\psi([p])$ for all $[p]\\in V(A)$. This $\\phi$ coincides with the description given in the problem.\n\n---\n\n### 3. $\\psi$ is well\u2011defined\n\nSuppose $p,q$ are projections in $M_\\infty(A)$ with $[p]=[q]$ in $V(A)$, i.e. $p\\sim q$. Then there exists a partial isometry $v$ such that $v^*v=p$ and $vv^*=q$. Tensoring with $1_X$ gives $v\\otimes 1_X\\in M_\\infty(C(X)\\otimes A)$. Using the properties of the tensor product and that $1_X$ is self\u2011adjoint, we compute\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n(v\\otimes 1_X)^*(v\\otimes 1_X) &= (v^*v)\\otimes 1_X = p\\otimes 1_X,\\\\\n(v\\otimes 1_X)(v\\otimes 1_X)^* &= (vv^*)\\otimes 1_X = q\\otimes 1_X.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus $v\\otimes 1_X$ is a partial isometry implementing $p\\otimes 1_X\\sim q\\otimes 1_X$. Hence $[p\\otimes 1_X]=[q\\otimes 1_X]$ in $V(C(X)\\otimes A)$.\n\nIf we change the matrix size by adding zeros (e.g. replace $p$ by $p'=p\\oplus0_k$), then $p'\\otimes 1_X=(p\\otimes 1_X)\\oplus0_k$, which is equivalent to $p\\otimes 1_X$. Therefore the definition of $\\psi$ does not depend on the choice of representative of the class in $V(A)$. So $\\psi$ is well\u2011defined.\n\n---\n\n### 4. $\\psi$ is a semigroup homomorphism\n\nTake $[p],[q]\\in V(A)$ with $p\\in M_n(A)$, $q\\in M_m(A)$. Then $[p]+[q]=[p\\oplus q]$. We have\n\n$$\n\\psi([p]+[q])=\\psi([p\\oplus q])=[(p\\oplus q)\\otimes 1_X].\n$$\n\nUnder the natural isomorphism $M_n(A)\\otimes C(X)\\;\\oplus\\; M_m(A)\\otimes C(X)\\;\\cong\\; M_{n+m}(A\\otimes C(X))$,\n\n$$\n(p\\oplus q)\\otimes 1_X = (p\\otimes 1_X)\\oplus (q\\otimes 1_X).\n$$\n\nConsequently,\n\n$$\n[(p\\oplus q)\\otimes 1_X] = [p\\otimes 1_X] + [q\\otimes 1_X] = \\psi([p])+\\psi([q]).\n$$\n\nThus $\\psi$ preserves the addition.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Extension to $K_0(A)$\n\nThe group $K_0(A)$ is the Grothendieck group of $V(A)$. Every element of $K_0(A)$ can be written as a formal difference $[p]-[q]$ with $[p],[q]\\in V(A)$. The universal property guarantees that any semigroup homomorphism $\\psi\\colon V(A)\\to G$ into an abelian group $G$ extends uniquely to a group homomorphism $\\phi\\colon K_0(A)\\to G$ satisfying $\\phi([p])=\\psi([p])$ for the images of $V(A)$ in $K_0(A)$. We take $G=K(X,A)=K_0(C(X)\\otimes A)$, which is an abelian group.\n\nExplicitly, define\n\n$$\n\\phi([p]-[q]) = \\psi([p]) - \\psi([q]) \\quad \\text{in } K(X,A).\n$$\n\nTo see that this is well\u2011defined, suppose $[p]-[q]=[p']-[q']$ in $K_0(A)$. By the definition of the Grothendieck group, there exists $[r]\\in V(A)$ such that\n\n$$\n[p] + [q'] + [r] = [p'] + [q] + [r] \\quad \\text{in } V(A).\n$$\n\nApplying the semigroup homomorphism $\\psi$ gives\n\n$$\n\\psi([p]) + \\psi([q']) + \\psi([r]) = \\psi([p']) + \\psi([q]) + \\psi([r]) \\quad \\text{in } V(C(X)\\otimes A)\\subseteq K(X,A).\n$$\n\nSince $K(X,A)$ is a group, we may cancel $\\psi([r])$ (or simply note that the equality holds in the group, so subtracting $\\psi([r])$ from both sides yields $\\psi([p])+\\psi([q'])=\\psi([p'])+\\psi([q])$). Rearranging, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\psi([p]) - \\psi([q]) = \\psi([p']) - \\psi([q']),\n$$\n\nwhich shows that $\\phi$ is independent of the representation of the element. It is then straightforward to verify that $\\phi$ is a group homomorphism: for $x=[p]-[q]$, $y=[p']-[q']$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\phi(x+y) &= \\phi\\bigl([p]+[p'] - ([q]+[q'])\\bigr) \\\\\n&= \\psi([p])+\\psi([p']) - \\bigl(\\psi([q])+\\psi([q'])\\bigr) \\\\\n&= \\bigl(\\psi([p])-\\psi([q])\\bigr) + \\bigl(\\psi([p'])-\\psi([q'])\\bigr) \\\\\n&= \\phi(x)+\\phi(y).\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### 6.

Conversely, if \\(x<0\\) satisfies \\(J_2(x)=0\\), then \\(|x|>0\\) and \\(J_2(|x|)=J_2(x)=0\\), so \\(|x|\\) is one of the \\(\\zeta_k\\).

Simplification\n\nRecall that \\(\\sinh x = \\frac{e^{x} - e^{-x}}{2}\\) and \\(\\sinh 1 = \\frac{e - e^{-1}}{2}\\).  \nThen\n\n\\[\ny(x) = \\frac{e}{e^{2} - 1} \\cdot 2 \\sinh x = \\frac{2e}{e^{2} - 1} \\sinh x.\n\\]\n\nBut\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2e}{e^{2} - 1} = \\frac{2}{e - e^{-1}} = \\frac{1}{\\sinh 1},\n\\]\n\nsince \\(\\frac{1}{\\sinh 1} = \\frac{2}{e - e^{-1}}\\).  \nHence\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{y(x) = \\frac{\\sinh x}{\\sinh 1}}.\n\\]\n\nOne can verify directly: \\(y(0) = 0\\), \\(y(1) = 1\\), and \\(y'' = y\\) because \\(\\sinh'' x = \\sinh x\\).\n\n### 5. Verification that it is a minimizer\n\nThe functional \\(J\\) is quadratic and strictly convex in \\((y, y')\\).  \nIndeed, the second variation\n\n\\[\n\\delta^{2} J[\\eta] = \\int_{0}^{1} \\bigl( 2\\eta(x)^{2} + 2\\eta'(x)^{2} \\bigr) dx\n\\]\n\nis positive for any nonzero variation \\(\\eta\\) with \\(\\eta(0)=\\eta(1)=0\\).  \nTherefore any solution of the Euler\u2013Lagrange equation yields a global minimum.  \nMoreover, strict convexity guarantees uniqueness: the function found is the unique minimizer of \\(J\\) under the given boundary conditions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe function that minimizes the functional \\(J[y]\\) is\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{y(x) = \\frac{\\sinh x}{\\sinh 1}}.\n\\]",
