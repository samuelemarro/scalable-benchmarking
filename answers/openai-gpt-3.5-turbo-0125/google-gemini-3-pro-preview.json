We can write $n = m(p-1) + 1$ for some integer $m$.\n   Using Fermat's Little Theorem ($2^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$):\n   $$2^n = 2^{m(p-1) + 1} = (2^{p-1})^m \\cdot 2^1 \\equiv 1^m \\cdot 2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{p}$$\n\n2. **Evaluate $n \\pmod{p}$:**\n   From the second congruence, we are given directly that:\n   $$n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{p}$$\n\n3. **Combine results:**\n   Subtracting the two results modulo $p$:\n   $$2^n - n \\equiv 2 - 2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$$\n\nThus, $p \\mid 2^n - n$ for all $n$ in the infinite arithmetic progression constructed.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn both cases ($p=2$ and $p$ odd), we have demonstrated the existence of an infinite set of positive integers $n$ such that $p \\mid 2^n - n$.\n\n**Q.E.D.**",

For a quartic $x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$, the resolvent cubic is given by:\n$$ R(z) = z^3 - bz^2 + (ac - 4d)z - (a^2d - 4bd + c^2) $$\nSubstituting $a=-3, b=4, c=-6, d=2$:\n- $ac - 4d = (-3)(-6) - 4(2) = 18 - 8 = 10$\n- $a^2d - 4bd + c^2 = (-3)^2(2) - 4(4)(2) + (-6)^2 = 18 - 32 + 36 = 22$\n$$ R(z) = z^3 - 4z^2 + 10z - 22 $$\nWe check for rational roots of $R(z)$ using the Rational Root Theorem (divisors of 22: $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 11, \\pm 22$).\n- $R(1) = 1 - 4 + 10 - 22 \\neq 0$\n- $R(2) = 8 - 16 + 20 - 22 = -10 \\neq 0$\n- ... and similarly for others.\n$R(z)$ has no rational roots and is cubic, so it is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThe discriminant of $f(x)$ is equal to the discriminant of $R(z)$. A computation yields $\\Delta = -5260$. Since $\\Delta < 0$, it is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nFor an irreducible quartic with an irreducible resolvent cubic and a non-square discriminant, the Galois group is the symmetric group $S_4$.\n$$ [K:\\mathbb{Q}] = |S_4| = 24 $$\n\n### Case 2: $F = \\mathbb{R}$ (The Field of Real Numbers)\nIf $F = \\mathbb{R}$, the degree is **2**.\n\nWe analyze the roots of $f(x)$ using calculus.\n$f'(x) = 4x^3 - 9x^2 + 8x - 6$.\nEvaluating $f(x)$ at specific points:\n- $f(0) = 2$\n- $f(1) = 1 - 3 + 4 - 6 + 2 = -2$ (Change of sign $\\implies$ real root in $(0,1)$)\n- $f(2) = 16 - 24 + 16 - 12 + 2 = -2$\n- $f(3) = 81 - 81 + 36 - 18 + 2 = 20$ (Change of sign $\\implies$ real root in $(2,3)$)\nThe polynomial has at least two real roots. Since the degree is 4, the other two roots must be complex conjugates (as they are not real). Let the roots be $r_1, r_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $z, \\bar{z} \\in \\mathbb{C} \\setminus \\mathbb{R}$.\nThe splitting field is $K = \\mathbb{R}(r_1, r_2, z, \\bar{z}) = \\mathbb{R}(z) = \\mathbb{C}$.\n$$ [K:\\mathbb{R}] = [\\mathbb{C}:\\mathbb{R}] = 2 $$\n\n### Case 3: $F = \\mathbb{F}_2$ (The Field with 2 Elements)\nIf $F = \\mathbb{F}_2$, the degree is **1**.\n\nReducing coefficients modulo 2:\n$$ f(x) = x^4 + x^3 \\in \\mathbb{F}_2[x] $$\n$$ f(x) = x^3(x+1) $$\nThe roots are $0, 0, 0, 1$, which are all elements of $\\mathbb{F}_2$. The polynomial splits completely in $F$.\n$$ [K:F] = 1 $$\n\n### Conclusion\nBecause the computed degree varies (24, 2, or 1) depending on the choice of the field $F$, and the question does not specify $F$, the question is missing a necessary constraint and cannot be answered uniquely.",

Let the two branches be defined by the functions:\n$$ y_1(x) = (x-1)\\sqrt{x+2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y_2(x) = -(x-1)\\sqrt{x+2} $$\nDifferentiating $y_1(x)$ with respect to $x$:\n$$ y_1'(x) = 1 \\cdot \\sqrt{x+2} + (x-1) \\frac{d}{dx}(\\sqrt{x+2}) $$\n$$ y_1'(x) = \\sqrt{x+2} + (x-1) \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{x+2}} $$\nEvaluating at $x = 1$:\n$$ m_1 = y_1'(1) = \\sqrt{1+2} + (0) = \\sqrt{3} $$\nSimilarly for $y_2(x) = -y_1(x)$, the slope is:\n$$ m_2 = y_2'(1) = -\\sqrt{3} $$\n\nAlternatively, using the tangent cone method (analyzing lowest degree terms):\nLet $u = x - 1$ and $v = y$. Substituting $x = u + 1$ into the curve equation:\n$$ v^2 = (u+1)^3 - 3(u+1) + 2 $$\n$$ v^2 = (u^3 + 3u^2 + 3u + 1) - 3u - 3 + 2 $$\n$$ v^2 = u^3 + 3u^2 $$\n$$ v^2 - 3u^2 - u^3 = 0 $$\nThe lowest degree terms form the equation of the tangent cone (the union of the tangent lines) at the origin of the $(u, v)$ system:\n$$ v^2 - 3u^2 = 0 $$\n$$ (v - \\sqrt{3}u)(v + \\sqrt{3}u) = 0 $$\nSubstituting back $v = y$ and $u = x - 1$, we get the two lines:\n$$ y = \\sqrt{3}(x-1) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y = -\\sqrt{3}(x-1) $$\n\n### Conclusion\nThe question asks for \"the equation of the tangent line,\" implying a unique solution. However, because $P(1, 0)$ is a singular point (specifically a node) where the curve intersects itself, a unique tangent line does not exist. Instead, there are two tangent lines corresponding to the two branches of the curve passing through $P$.\n\nThe equations of the two tangent lines are:\n$$ y = \\sqrt{3}x - \\sqrt{3} $$\n$$ y = -\\sqrt{3}x + \\sqrt{3} $$",

Mathematical Context and Definitions\n\n**Spaces and Algebras:**\n*   Let $X$ be a compact Hausdorff space. Let $C(X)$ denote the $C^*$-algebra of continuous complex-valued functions on $X$. Since $X$ is compact, $C(X)$ is unital with identity element $1_X$ (the constant function $x \\mapsto 1$).\n*   Let $A$ be a separable $C^*$-algebra.\n*   The target group $K(X, A)$ is interpreted in the standard sense of operator $K$-theory as the $K_0$-group of the $C^*$-algebra of continuous functions from $X$ to $A$, denoted $C(X, A)$.\n*   There is a canonical isomorphism $C(X, A) \\cong A \\otimes C(X)$.

The question defines $\\phi$ on elements of the form $[p]$. We must show this assignment is consistent with the equivalence relations defining $K_0(A)$.\n\n### 2. Construction of the Homomorphism\n\nWe identify $\\phi$ as the map induced by a specific $*$-homomorphism between $C^*$-algebras.\n\n**Step 1: Define the Constant Embedding**\nConsider the map $\\iota: A \\to C(X, A)$ defined by sending an element $a \\in A$ to the constant function on $X$ with value $a$:\n$$ \\iota(a)(x) = a \\quad \\text{for all } x \\in X. $$\nIn the tensor product picture $A \\otimes C(X)$, this map is given by $a \\mapsto a \\otimes 1_X$.\n\n**Step 2: Verify $\\iota$ is a $*$-homomorphism**\nThe map $\\iota$ preserves the algebraic structure:\n*   **Linearity**: $\\iota(\\lambda a + b) = (\\lambda a + b) \\otimes 1_X = \\lambda(a \\otimes 1_X) + (b \\otimes 1_X) = \\lambda \\iota(a) + \\iota(b)$.\n*   **Multiplication**: $\\iota(ab) = (ab) \\otimes 1_X = (a \\otimes 1_X)(b \\otimes 1_X) = \\iota(a)\\iota(b)$ (since $1_X \\cdot 1_X = 1_X$).\n*   **Involution**: $\\iota(a^*) = a^* \\otimes 1_X = (a \\otimes 1_X)^* = \\iota(a)^*$.\n\nThus, $\\iota$ is a $*$-homomorphism.\n\n**Step 3: Functoriality of $K_0$**\nThe $K_0$ construction is a covariant functor from the category of $C^*$-algebras to the category of Abelian groups. Therefore, any $*$-homomorphism $\\psi: A \\to B$ induces a well-defined group homomorphism $K_0(\\psi): K_0(A) \\to K_0(B)$.\n\nApplying this to $\\iota$, we obtain a well-defined homomorphism:\n$$ K_0(\\iota): K_0(A) \\to K_0(C(X, A)). $$\nFor a class $[p] \\in K_0(A)$ represented by a projection $p \\in M_n(A)$, the induced map is given by:\n$$ K_0(\\iota)([p]) = [\\iota(p)]. $$\nHere, $\\iota(p)$ is applying $\\iota$ entry-wise to the matrix $p$. The result is the constant matrix-valued function $x \\mapsto p$, which is exactly $p \\otimes 1_X$ in $M_n(A) \\otimes C(X)$.\n\nThus, $K_0(\\iota)([p]) = [p \\otimes 1_X]$. This matches the definition of $\\phi([p])$ given in the problem statement.\n\n### 3. Direct Verification of Well-Definedness\n\nTo ensure rigor, we explicitly verify that the map respects the equivalence relations in $K_0(A)$ without solely relying on the functoriality statement.\n\n**Requirement:**\nWe must show that if $[p] = [q]$ in $K_0(A)$, then $[p \\otimes 1_X] = [q \\otimes 1_X]$ in $K(X, A)$.\n\n**Proof:**\n1.  **Relation in $K_0(A)$**: The equality $[p] = [q]$ in the Grothendieck group $K_0(A)$ holds if and only if $p$ and $q$ are stably equivalent. That is, there exist a projection $r \\in M_k(A)$ and an integer $n$ such that:\n    $$ p \\oplus r \\sim_0 q \\oplus r \\quad \\text{in } M_{n+k}(A). $$\n    Here $\\sim_0$ denotes Murray-von Neumann equivalence.\n\n2.  **Murray-von Neumann Equivalence**: The condition $p \\oplus r \\sim_0 q \\oplus r$ implies there exists a partial isometry $v \\in M_{n+k}(A)$ such that:\n    $$ v^*v = p \\oplus r \\quad \\text{and} \\quad vv^* = q \\oplus r. $$\n\n3.  **Mapping to $C(X, A)$**: Apply the map $\\iota$ (tensoring with $1_X$) to these elements. Let $V = v \\otimes 1_X$, $P = p \\otimes 1_X$, $Q = q \\otimes 1_X$, and $R = r \\otimes 1_X$.\n    Compute the products in $M_{n+k}(C(X, A))$:\n    $$ V^*V = (v^* \\otimes 1_X)(v \\otimes 1_X) = (v^*v) \\otimes 1_X = (p \\oplus r) \\otimes 1_X = P \\oplus R. $$\n    $$ VV^* = (v \\otimes 1_X)(v^* \\otimes 1_X) = (vv^*) \\otimes 1_X = (q \\oplus r) \\otimes 1_X = Q \\oplus R. $$\n\n4.  **Conclusion in Target Group**:\n    The existence of $V$ shows that $P \\oplus R \\sim_0 Q \\oplus R$ in the algebra $M_{n+k}(C(X, A))$.\n    This implies $[P \\oplus R] = [Q \\oplus R]$ in the semigroup $V(C(X, A))$.\n    In the group $K_0(C(X, A))$, this translates to:\n    $$ [P] + [R] = [Q] + [R]. $$\n    Since $K_0(C(X, A))$ is a group, we can cancel $[R]$ from both sides to obtain:\n    $$ [P] = [Q] \\implies [p \\otimes 1_X] = [q \\otimes 1_X]. $$\n\n**Additivity:**\nFinally, we check $\\phi$ is a homomorphism:\n$$ \\phi([p] + [q]) = \\phi([p \\oplus q]) = [(p \\oplus q) \\otimes 1_X]. $$\n$$ \\phi([p]) + \\phi([q]) = [p \\otimes 1_X] + [q \\otimes 1_X] = [(p \\otimes 1_X) \\oplus (q \\otimes 1_X)]. $$\nNote that $(p \\oplus q) \\otimes 1_X = \\text{diag}(p, q) \\otimes 1_X = \\text{diag}(p \\otimes 1_X, q \\otimes 1_X) = (p \\otimes 1_X) \\oplus (q \\otimes 1_X)$.\nThus, $\\phi([p] + [q]) = \\phi([p]) + \\phi([q])$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe map $\\phi$ is the homomorphism induced on the $K_0$-groups by the $*$-homomorphism $\\iota: A \\to A \\otimes C(X)$ defined by $a \\mapsto a \\otimes 1_X$. As the induced map of a $*$-homomorphism, it preserves the equivalence relations defining the $K_0$ group and the group operation.\n\nTherefore, **$\\phi$ is a well-defined group homomorphism.**",

Let $V = v \\otimes 1_X$, $P = p \\otimes 1_X$, $Q = q \\otimes 1_X$, and $R = r \\otimes 1_X$.\n    Compute the products in $M_{n+k}(C(X, A))$:\n    $$ V^*V = (v^* \\otimes 1_X)(v \\otimes 1_X) = (v^*v) \\otimes 1_X = (p \\oplus r) \\otimes 1_X = P \\oplus R. $$\n    $$ VV^* = (v \\otimes 1_X)(v^* \\otimes 1_X) = (vv^*) \\otimes 1_X = (q \\oplus r) \\otimes 1_X = Q \\oplus R. $$\n\n4.  **Conclusion in Target Group**:\n    The existence of $V$ shows that $P \\oplus R \\sim_0 Q \\oplus R$ in the algebra $M_{n+k}(C(X, A))$.\n    This implies $[P \\oplus R] = [Q \\oplus R]$ in the semigroup $V(C(X, A))$.\n    In the group $K_0(C(X, A))$, this translates to:\n    $$ [P] + [R] = [Q] + [R]. $$\n    Since $K_0(C(X, A))$ is a group, we can cancel $[R]$ from both sides to obtain:\n    $$ [P] = [Q] \\implies [p \\otimes 1_X] = [q \\otimes 1_X]. $$\n\n**Additivity:**\nFinally, we check $\\phi$ is a homomorphism:\n$$ \\phi([p] + [q]) = \\phi([p \\oplus q]) = [(p \\oplus q) \\otimes 1_X]. $$\n$$ \\phi([p]) + \\phi([q]) = [p \\otimes 1_X] + [q \\otimes 1_X] = [(p \\otimes 1_X) \\oplus (q \\otimes 1_X)]. $$\nNote that $(p \\oplus q) \\otimes 1_X = \\text{diag}(p, q) \\otimes 1_X = \\text{diag}(p \\otimes 1_X, q \\otimes 1_X) = (p \\otimes 1_X) \\oplus (q \\otimes 1_X)$.\nThus, $\\phi([p] + [q]) = \\phi([p]) + \\phi([q])$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe map $\\phi$ is the homomorphism induced on the $K_0$-groups by the $*$-homomorphism $\\iota: A \\to A \\otimes C(X)$ defined by $a \\mapsto a \\otimes 1_X$. As the induced map of a $*$-homomorphism, it preserves the equivalence relations defining the $K_0$ group and the group operation.\n\nTherefore, **$\\phi$ is a well-defined group homomorphism.**",

        "answer": "To find the value of $f(2022)$, we will analyze the given functional equation and derive the explicit form of the function $f(x)$.\n\n### 1. Analyzing the Functional Equation\n\nWe are given the functional equation:\n$$f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y) + 2xy \\quad \\text{for all } x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$$\nWe are also given that $f$ is continuous and $f(1) = 3$.\n\nThe term $2xy$ suggests that $f(x)$ contains a quadratic term. Recall that $(x+y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy$. This identity shares the $2xy$ structure with our functional equation. This motivates us to define an auxiliary function to simplify the equation.\n\nLet us define a new function $g: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ as:\n$$g(x) = f(x) - x^2$$\n\nSince $f(x)$ is continuous and $x^2$ is continuous, $g(x)$ is also a continuous function.\n\n### 2. Deriving the Equation for the Auxiliary Function\n\nWe substitute $f(x) = g(x) + x^2$ into the original functional equation.\n\n**Left-hand side (LHS):**\n$$f(x+y) = g(x+y) + (x+y)^2 = g(x+y) + x^2 + 2xy + y^2$$\n\n**Right-hand side (RHS):**\n$$f(x) + f(y) + 2xy = (g(x) + x^2) + (g(y) + y^2) + 2xy$$\n$$= g(x) + g(y) + x^2 + y^2 + 2xy$$\n\nEquating the LHS and RHS:\n$$g(x+y) + x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = g(x) + g(y) + x^2 + y^2 + 2xy$$\n\nSubtracting $x^2 + y^2 + 2xy$ from both sides, we obtain:\n$$g(x+y) = g(x) + g(y)$$\n\n### 3.

        "raw_answer": "To find the value of $f(2022)$, we will analyze the given functional equation and derive the explicit form of the function $f(x)$.\n\n### 1. Analyzing the Functional Equation\n\nWe are given the functional equation:\n$$f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y) + 2xy \\quad \\text{for all } x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$$\nWe are also given that $f$ is continuous and $f(1) = 3$.\n\nThe term $2xy$ suggests that $f(x)$ contains a quadratic term. Recall that $(x+y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy$. This identity shares the $2xy$ structure with our functional equation. This motivates us to define an auxiliary function to simplify the equation.\n\nLet us define a new function $g: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ as:\n$$g(x) = f(x) - x^2$$\n\nSince $f(x)$ is continuous and $x^2$ is continuous, $g(x)$ is also a continuous function.\n\n### 2.

Definition and Behavior at $x=0$\n\nThe Bessel function of the first kind of integer order $n \\ge 0$ is defined by the series expansion:\n$$ J_n(x) = \\sum_{m=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^m}{m! \\, \\Gamma(m+n+1)} \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^{2m+n} $$\nSubstituting $n=2$:\n$$ J_2(x) = \\sum_{m=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^m}{m! \\, (m+2)!} \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^{2m+2} $$\nThe first term of this series (where $m=0$) is:\n$$ \\frac{(-1)^0}{0! \\, 2!} \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{x^2}{4} = \\frac{x^2}{8} $$\nSince every term in the series contains a factor of $x^k$ with $k \\ge 2$, it is evident that $J_2(0) = 0$.\n\n**Conclusion 1:** $x = 0$ is a solution.\n\n### 2. Symmetry of Solutions\n\nWe examine the parity of the function $J_2(x)$. Using the property $J_n(-x) = (-1)^n J_n(x)$ for integer $n$:\n$$ J_2(-x) = (-1)^2 J_2(x) = J_2(x) $$\nThis shows that $J_2(x)$ is an even function. Consequently, the non-zero solutions appear in pairs: if $x = \\alpha$ is a solution, then $x = -\\alpha$ is also a solution.\n\n### 3. Positive Real Zeros\n\nAccording to the general theory of Bessel functions (specifically, the Sturm-Liouville theory applied to Bessel's differential equation), the function $J_n(x)$ for real $n$ has infinitely many real zeros.\n\nLet the sequence of positive simple zeros of $J_2(x)$ be denoted by $j_{2,k}$ for $k = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$, ordered such that:\n$$ 0 < j_{2,1} < j_{2,2} < j_{2,3} < \\dots $$\n\nThese values are transcendental numbers and do not have closed-form expressions in terms of elementary functions. Their approximate values can be determined numerically or via asymptotic formulas. For large $k$, the zeros approximate to:\n$$ j_{2,k} \\approx \\left(k + \\frac{2}{2} - \\frac{1}{4}\\right)\\pi = \\left(k + \\frac{3}{4}\\right)\\pi $$\n\nThe first few positive zeros are approximately:\n- $j_{2,1} \\approx 5.1356$\n- $j_{2,2} \\approx 8.4172$\n- $j_{2,3} \\approx 11.6198$\n\n### 4. Completeness of the Solution Set\n\nLommel's Theorem guarantees that for $n > -1$, all zeros of $J_n(x)$ are real. Since $n=2$, there are no complex non-real roots.

Definition and Behavior at $x=0$\n\nThe Bessel function of the first kind of integer order $n \\ge 0$ is defined by the series expansion:\n$$ J_n(x) = \\sum_{m=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^m}{m! \\, \\Gamma(m+n+1)} \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^{2m+n} $$\nSubstituting $n=2$:\n$$ J_2(x) = \\sum_{m=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^m}{m! \\, (m+2)!} \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^{2m+2} $$\nThe first term of this series (where $m=0$) is:\n$$ \\frac{(-1)^0}{0! \\, 2!} \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{x^2}{4} = \\frac{x^2}{8} $$\nSince every term in the series contains a factor of $x^k$ with $k \\ge 2$, it is evident that $J_2(0) = 0$.\n\n**Conclusion 1:** $x = 0$ is a solution.\n\n### 2. Symmetry of Solutions\n\nWe examine the parity of the function $J_2(x)$. Using the property $J_n(-x) = (-1)^n J_n(x)$ for integer $n$:\n$$ J_2(-x) = (-1)^2 J_2(x) = J_2(x) $$\nThis shows that $J_2(x)$ is an even function. Consequently, the non-zero solutions appear in pairs: if $x = \\alpha$ is a solution, then $x = -\\alpha$ is also a solution.\n\n### 3. Positive Real Zeros\n\nAccording to the general theory of Bessel functions (specifically, the Sturm-Liouville theory applied to Bessel's differential equation), the function $J_n(x)$ for real $n$ has infinitely many real zeros.\n\nLet the sequence of positive simple zeros of $J_2(x)$ be denoted by $j_{2,k}$ for $k = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$, ordered such that:\n$$ 0 < j_{2,1} < j_{2,2} < j_{2,3} < \\dots $$\n\nThese values are transcendental numbers and do not have closed-form expressions in terms of elementary functions. Their approximate values can be determined numerically or via asymptotic formulas. For large $k$, the zeros approximate to:\n$$ j_{2,k} \\approx \\left(k + \\frac{2}{2} - \\frac{1}{4}\\right)\\pi = \\left(k + \\frac{3}{4}\\right)\\pi $$\n\nThe first few positive zeros are approximately:\n- $j_{2,1} \\approx 5.1356$\n- $j_{2,2} \\approx 8.4172$\n- $j_{2,3} \\approx 11.6198$\n\n### 4. Completeness of the Solution Set\n\nLommel's Theorem guarantees that for $n > -1$, all zeros of $J_n(x)$ are real. Since $n=2$, there are no complex non-real roots.

For any even integer $m=2n$, $c_{2n} = c_n$.\n\n**Step 3.4: Iterative Deduction**\nWe now show that $c_m = 0$ for all $m \\neq 0$.\nLet $m$ be a non-zero integer. We can write $m$ uniquely as $m = 2^k \\cdot l$, where $k \\geq 0$ is an integer and $l$ is an odd integer.\nUsing the relation $c_{2n} = c_n$ repeatedly:\n$$c_m = c_{2^k l} = c_{2^{k-1} l} = \\dots = c_l$$\nSince $l$ is odd, we know from condition (1) above that $c_l = 0$.\nTherefore, $c_m = 0$ for all $m \\neq 0$.\n\n**Step 3.5: Conclusion**\nSince all Fourier coefficients $c_m$ are zero for $m \\neq 0$, the Fourier series reduces to:\n$$f(x) = c_0$$\nThis holds in the $L^2$ sense, which implies $f(x) = c_0$ almost everywhere.\n\nSince the only $T$-invariant functions in $L^2$ are constants (a.e.), the transformation $T$ is ergodic.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe dynamical system $x_{n+1} = 2x_n \\pmod 1$ preserves the Lebesgue measure, and the only invariant sets have measure 0 or 1. Thus, **the system is ergodic**.",

Computing the 10th Derivative\n\nLet us analyze the derivatives of $f(x) = \\sin(x)$.\n$$ \\begin{aligned} f(x) &= \\sin(x) \\\\ f'(x) &= \\cos(x) \\\\ f''(x) &= -\\sin(x) \\\\ f'''(x) &= -\\cos(x) \\\\ f^{(4)}(x) &= \\sin(x) \\end{aligned} $$\nThe derivatives of $\\sin(x)$ repeat with a period of 4. Specifically, for any non-negative integer $k$:\n$$ f^{(k)}(x) = \\sin\\left(x + \\frac{k\\pi}{2}\\right) $$\nWe need the 10th derivative, $f^{(10)}(x)$. Since $10 = 4 \\times 2 + 2$, the 10th derivative corresponds to the 2nd derivative in the cycle:\n$$ f^{(10)}(x) = f^{(2)}(x) = -\\sin(x) $$\n\n### 3. Evaluating at the Center $x=0$\n\nNow, we evaluate the 10th derivative at $x=0$:\n$$ f^{(10)}(0) = -\\sin(0) = 0 $$\n\nAlternatively, we can observe the general pattern for the derivatives of sine at zero:\n- For even $n=2k$, $f^{(2k)}(0) = (-1)^k \\sin(0) = 0$.\n- For odd $n=2k+1$, $f^{(2k+1)}(0) = (-1)^k \\cos(0) = (-1)^k$.\n\nSince $n=10$ is an even number, $f^{(10)}(0) = 0$.\n\n### 4. Calculation of the Coefficient\n\nSubstituting the value of the derivative into the coefficient formula:\n$$ a_{10} = \\frac{f^{(10)}(0)}{10!} = \\frac{0}{10!} = 0 $$\n\n### 5. Verification via Standard Series\n\nThe standard Maclaurin series for $\\sin(x)$ is well-known:\n$$ \\sin(x) = x - \\frac{x^3}{3!} + \\frac{x^5}{5!} - \\frac{x^7}{7!} + \\dots = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^k}{(2k+1)!} x^{2k+1} $$\nThis series contains only terms with odd powers of $x$. The term $x^{10}$ involves an even power of $x$. Therefore, the coefficient of the $x^{10}$ term in this series is identically zero.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe coefficient $a_{10}$ of the $x^{10}$ term in the Taylor series expansion of $f(x) = \\sin(x)$ centered at $x=0$ is **0**.",

By the definition of $W$, this implies:\n$$ \\sup_{x \\in K} |\\chi(\\xi - \\xi_0, x) - 1| < \\delta $$\nSubstituting this back into our integral estimate:\n$$ |\\hat{f}(\\xi) - \\hat{f}(\\xi_0)| \\leq \\int_{K} |f(x)| \\left| \\chi(\\xi - \\xi_0, x) - 1 \\right| \\, dx $$\n$$ < \\int_{K} |f(x)| \\cdot \\delta \\, dx $$\n$$ = \\delta \\int_{K} |f(x)| \\, dx $$\n$$ = \\delta \\|f\\|_1 $$\nSubstituting $\\delta = \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\|f\\|_1}$:\n$$ |\\hat{f}(\\xi) - \\hat{f}(\\xi_0)| < \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\|f\\|_1} \\|f\\|_1 = \\epsilon $$\n\n### Conclusion\nWe have shown that for any $\\xi_0 \\in \\widehat{G}$ and any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists an open neighborhood $V$ of $\\xi_0$ such that for all $\\xi \\in V$, $|\\hat{f}(\\xi) - \\hat{f}(\\xi_0)| < \\epsilon$.

The Euler-Lagrange Equation\n\nLet the integrand be denoted by $F(x, y, y') = y^2 + (y')^2$.\nA necessary condition for a function $y(x)$ to be an extremum (minimizer) of the functional $J[y]$ is that it satisfies the Euler-Lagrange equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} - \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y'} \\right) = 0 $$\n\nFirst, we compute the partial derivatives of $F$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 2y $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y'} = 2y' $$\n\nNext, we differentiate $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y'}$ with respect to $x$:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dx} (2y') = 2y'' $$\n\nSubstituting these terms into the Euler-Lagrange equation gives:\n$$ 2y - 2y'' = 0 $$\nDividing by $-2$, we obtain the following linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation:\n$$ y'' - y = 0 $$\n\n### 2. General Solution of the Differential Equation\n\nThe characteristic equation associated with the differential equation $y'' - y = 0$ is:\n$$ r^2 - 1 = 0 \\implies r = \\pm 1 $$\n\nThe general solution is a linear combination of exponentials:\n$$ y(x) = C_1 e^x + C_2 e^{-x} $$\nAlternatively, this can be expressed using hyperbolic functions, which simplifies the application of boundary conditions at $x=0$:\n$$ y(x) = A \\sinh(x) + B \\cosh(x) $$\n\n### 3. Applying Boundary Conditions\n\nWe determine the constants $A$ and $B$ using the given boundary conditions $y(0) = 0$ and $y(1) = 1$.\n\n**Condition 1: $y(0) = 0$**\n$$ y(0) = A \\sinh(0) + B \\cosh(0) = A(0) + B(1) = B $$\nSince $y(0) = 0$, we must have:\n$$ B = 0 $$\n\nSubstituting $B=0$ back into the general solution reduces it to:\n$$ y(x) = A \\sinh(x) $$\n\n**Condition 2: $y(1) = 1$**\n$$ y(1) = A \\sinh(1) $$\nSet this equal to the boundary value 1:\n$$ A \\sinh(1) = 1 $$\nSolving for $A$:\n$$ A = \\frac{1}{\\sinh(1)} $$\n\nThus, the candidate function is:\n$$ y(x) = \\frac{\\sinh(x)}{\\sinh(1)} $$\n\n### 4. Verification of Minimization\n\nTo ensure this stationary function is a minimizer, we examine the convexity of the integrand $F(y, y') = y^2 + (y')^2$. The Hessian matrix with respect to $y$ and $y'$ is:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial y^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial y \\partial y'} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial y' \\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial y'^2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSince this matrix is positive definite everywhere, the integrand is strictly convex in $y$ and $y'$. Therefore, any solution to the Euler-Lagrange equation satisfying the boundary conditions is the unique global minimizer of the functional.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe function that minimizes the functional $J[y]$ is:\n$$ y(x) = \\frac{\\sinh(x)}{\\sinh(1)} $$",

Letting $\\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{r}(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt} (\\mathbf{r}(t) \\cdot \\mathbf{r}(t)) = \\mathbf{r}'(t) \\cdot \\mathbf{r}(t) + \\mathbf{r}(t) \\cdot \\mathbf{r}'(t) $$\n\nSince the dot product is commutative ($\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} = \\mathbf{b} \\cdot \\mathbf{a}$), this simplifies to:\n$$ 2 \\mathbf{r}'(t) \\cdot \\mathbf{r}(t) $$\n\nEquating the derivative of the left-hand side to the derivative of the right-hand side:\n$$ 2 \\mathbf{r}'(t) \\cdot \\mathbf{r}(t) = 0 $$\n\nDividing by 2, we find:\n$$ \\mathbf{r}'(t) \\cdot \\mathbf{r}(t) = 0 \\quad (**)$$\n\n**3. Relation to the Tangent Vector**\n\nThe vector $\\mathbf{r}'(t)$ represents the velocity vector of the curve and points in the direction of the tangent line. The unit tangent vector $\\mathbf{T}(t)$ is defined as the normalized velocity vector (assuming $\\mathbf{r}'(t) \\neq \\mathbf{0}$, which holds for a regular smooth curve):\n$$ \\mathbf{T}(t) = \\frac{\\mathbf{r}'(t)}{\\|\\mathbf{r}'(t)\\|} $$\n\nSubstitute $\\mathbf{r}'(t) = \\|\\mathbf{r}'(t)\\| \\mathbf{T}(t)$ into equation $(**)$:\n$$ (\\|\\mathbf{r}'(t)\\| \\mathbf{T}(t)) \\cdot \\mathbf{r}(t) = 0 $$\n\nSince $\\|\\mathbf{r}'(t)\\|$ is a scalar, we can factor it out:\n$$ \\|\\mathbf{r}'(t)\\| (\\mathbf{T}(t) \\cdot \\mathbf{r}(t)) = 0 $$\n\nSince the curve is smooth, we assume $\\|\\mathbf{r}'(t)\\| \\neq 0$. Therefore, it must be that:\n$$ \\mathbf{T}(t) \\cdot \\mathbf{r}(t) = 0 $$\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe condition $\\mathbf{T}(t) \\cdot \\mathbf{r}(t) = 0$ implies that the vectors $\\mathbf{T}(t)$ and $\\mathbf{r}(t)$ are orthogonal.\n\nThus, we have proven that for any smooth curve lying on a sphere centered at the origin, the tangent vector to the curve is always orthogonal to the position vector.",

Definition and Goal\n\nLet $V$ be the set of vertices in graph $G$, with $|V| = n$.\nThe problem defines a vertex $v \\in V$ as a **hub** if it is adjacent to at least $\\lceil \\frac{n}{2} \\rceil$ other vertices. In standard graph theory terminology, this condition is equivalent to:\n$$ \\deg(v) \\ge \\left\\lceil \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rceil $$\nwhere $\\deg(v)$ denotes the degree of vertex $v$.\n\nWe want to find the maximum possible number of hubs in $G$. Since the number of hubs cannot exceed the total number of vertices, the theoretical maximum is $n$. We will investigate whether there exists a simple undirected graph with $n$ vertices where **every** vertex is a hub.\n\n### 2. Candidate Graph: The Complete Graph $K_n$\n\nConsider the complete graph $K_n$, which is a simple undirected graph with $n$ vertices where every distinct pair of vertices is connected by a unique edge.\n\nIn $K_n$, every vertex $v$ is connected to all other $n-1$ vertices. Therefore, the degree of every vertex is:\n$$ \\deg(v) = n - 1 \\quad \\text{for all } v \\in V $$\n\nFor every vertex to be a hub, the following inequality must hold:\n$$ n - 1 \\ge \\left\\lceil \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rceil $$\n\n### 3. Verification of the Condition\n\nWe verify the inequality $n - 1 \\ge \\lceil \\frac{n}{2} \\rceil$ for all $n \\ge 3$. We analyze the cases for even and odd $n$ separately.\n\n**Case 1: $n$ is even**\nLet $n = 2k$ for some integer $k$. Since $n \\ge 3$, we have $k \\ge 2$.\n- The threshold is $\\left\\lceil \\frac{2k}{2} \\right\\rceil = k$.\n- The degree of each vertex is $n - 1 = 2k - 1$.\n- We check if $2k - 1 \\ge k$:\n  $$ 2k - 1 \\ge k \\iff k \\ge 1 $$\n  Since $k \\ge 2$, this inequality holds strictly.\n\n**Case 2: $n$ is odd**\nLet $n = 2k + 1$ for some integer $k$. Since $n \\ge 3$, we have $k \\ge 1$.\n- The threshold is $\\left\\lceil \\frac{2k+1}{2} \\right\\rceil = \\lceil k + 0.5 \\rceil = k + 1$.\n- The degree of each vertex is $n - 1 = (2k + 1) - 1 = 2k$.\n- We check if $2k \\ge k + 1$:\n  $$ 2k \\ge k + 1 \\iff k \\ge 1 $$\n  Since $k \\ge 1$ (corresponding to $n \\ge 3$), this inequality holds.\n\n**Smallest Case ($n=3$):**\n- $\\lceil 3/2 \\rceil = 2$.\n- In $K_3$, $\\deg(v) = 2$.\n- $2 \\ge 2$ holds.

        "raw_answer": "To determine the maximum number of hubs that a simple undirected graph $G$ with $n$ vertices can have, we proceed by analyzing the definition of a \"hub\" and testing if the maximum possible set of vertices (all $n$ vertices) can simultaneously satisfy this definition.\n\n### 1. Definition and Goal\n\nLet $V$ be the set of vertices in graph $G$, with $|V| = n$.\nThe problem defines a vertex $v \\in V$ as a **hub** if it is adjacent to at least $\\lceil \\frac{n}{2} \\rceil$ other vertices.

Therefore, the degree of every vertex is:\n$$ \\deg(v) = n - 1 \\quad \\text{for all } v \\in V $$\n\nFor every vertex to be a hub, the following inequality must hold:\n$$ n - 1 \\ge \\left\\lceil \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rceil $$\n\n### 3. Verification of the Condition\n\nWe verify the inequality $n - 1 \\ge \\lceil \\frac{n}{2} \\rceil$ for all $n \\ge 3$. We analyze the cases for even and odd $n$ separately.\n\n**Case 1: $n$ is even**\nLet $n = 2k$ for some integer $k$. Since $n \\ge 3$, we have $k \\ge 2$.\n- The threshold is $\\left\\lceil \\frac{2k}{2} \\right\\rceil = k$.\n- The degree of each vertex is $n - 1 = 2k - 1$.\n- We check if $2k - 1 \\ge k$:\n  $$ 2k - 1 \\ge k \\iff k \\ge 1 $$\n  Since $k \\ge 2$, this inequality holds strictly.\n\n**Case 2: $n$ is odd**\nLet $n = 2k + 1$ for some integer $k$. Since $n \\ge 3$, we have $k \\ge 1$.\n- The threshold is $\\left\\lceil \\frac{2k+1}{2} \\right\\rceil = \\lceil k + 0.5 \\rceil = k + 1$.\n- The degree of each vertex is $n - 1 = (2k + 1) - 1 = 2k$.\n- We check if $2k \\ge k + 1$:\n  $$ 2k \\ge k + 1 \\iff k \\ge 1 $$\n  Since $k \\ge 1$ (corresponding to $n \\ge 3$), this inequality holds.\n\n**Smallest Case ($n=3$):**\n- $\\lceil 3/2 \\rceil = 2$.\n- In $K_3$, $\\deg(v) = 2$.\n- $2 \\ge 2$ holds.

Characterization of Units in $R[x]$\n\nTo determine the properties of $f(x)$ and $f'(x)$, we invoke a standard result in commutative algebra regarding units in polynomial rings (e.g., Atiyah-MacDonald, Proposition 1.2).\n\n**Theorem:** Let $R$ be a commutative ring. A polynomial $f(x) = a_0 + a_1x + \\dots + a_nx^n \\in R[x]$ is a unit (invertible) in $R[x]$ if and only if:\n1.  $a_0$ is a unit in $R$.\n2.  $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ are nilpotent elements in $R$.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the Premises\n\nLet $f(x) = a_n x^n + \\dots + a_1 x + a_0$ be a polynomial of degree $n \\geq 1$.\nAssume $f(x)$ is a unit in $R[x]$. Applying the theorem above:\n*   The coefficient $a_1$ is a nilpotent element in $R$.\n\nNow consider the formal derivative of $f(x)$:\n$$f'(x) = na_n x^{n-1} + \\dots + 2a_2 x + a_1$$\n\nThe constant term of $f'(x)$ is $a_1$.\n\n### 3. Logical Contradiction\n\nFor $f'(x)$ to be a unit in $R[x]$, its constant term must be a unit in $R$ (by the same theorem). Therefore, for the claim in the question to hold, $a_1$ would have to be a unit in $R$.\n\nHowever, from the premises, we established that $a_1$ is **nilpotent**.\nLet us check if an element can be both nilpotent and a unit.\n*   Let $x \\in R$ be nilpotent. Then $x^k = 0$ for some integer $k \\geq 1$.\n*   Let $x \\in R$ be a unit. Then there exists $v \\in R$ such that $xv = 1$.\n\nIf $x$ is both, we have:\n$$1 = 1^k = (xv)^k = x^k v^k = 0 \\cdot v^k = 0$$\nThis implies $1_R = 0_R$.\nThe problem explicitly states $1_R \\neq 0_R$. Thus, no element in $R$ can be both a unit and nilpotent.\n\n**Conclusion:** Since $a_1$ must be nilpotent (because $f$ is a unit) and cannot be a unit, the constant term of $f'(x)$ is not a unit. Therefore, **$f'(x)$ cannot be a unit in $R[x]$.**\n\n### 4. Concrete Counterexample\n\nTo demonstrate that the statement is false, we construct a specific example satisfying all premises but failing the conclusion.\n\n**Construction:**\n*   Let $R = \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ (the integers modulo 4). This is a commutative ring with $1 \\neq 0$.\n*   Let $f(x) = 1 + 2x \\in R[x]$.\n    *   Here $n=1$, satisfying $n \\geq 1$.\n    *   $f(x)$ is non-zero.\n\n**Verification of Hypothesis:**\nWe check if $f(x)$ is a unit in $\\mathbb{Z}_4[x]$ by computing its square:\n$$f(x)^2 = (1 + 2x)(1 + 2x) = 1 + 2x + 2x + 4x^2 = 1 + 4x + 0 = 1$$\nSince $f(x) \\cdot f(x) = 1$, $f(x)$ is a unit. (Alternatively, $a_0=1$ is a unit and $a_1=2$ is nilpotent since $2^2=0$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_4$).\n\n**Verification of Conclusion:**\nCompute the derivative $f'(x)$:\n$$f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(1 + 2x) = 2$$\nIs $f'(x) = 2$ a unit in $\\mathbb{Z}_4[x]$?\nFor $2$ to be a unit, there must exist a polynomial $g(x)$ such that $2 \\cdot g(x) = 1$. Looking at the constant terms, we would need $2 \\cdot b_0 = 1$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_4$.\nChecking the multiplication table for $\\mathbb{Z}_4$:\n*   $2 \\cdot 0 = 0$\n*   $2 \\cdot 1 = 2$\n*   $2 \\cdot 2 = 0$\n*   $2 \\cdot 3 = 2$\nThere is no solution to $2b_0 = 1$. Thus, $2$ is not a unit.\n\n**Result:** $f(x)$ is a unit, but $f'(x)$ is not. The statement is false.\n\n### 5. Correct Classification of $f'(x)$\n\nWhile $f'(x)$ is not a unit, we can rigorously prove what it *is*. Since $f(x)$ is a unit, all coefficients $a_1, \\dots, a_n$ are nilpotent. The coefficients of $f'(x)$ are $k a_k$ (integer multiples of these coefficients). In a commutative ring, the set of nilpotent elements forms an ideal (the nilradical). Therefore, any linear combination of nilpotent elements is nilpotent.\nThus, if $f(x)$ is a unit, **$f'(x)$ is a nilpotent element** in $R[x]$.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe statement is **false**. If $f(x)$ is a unit in $R[x]$ with $\\deg(f) \\geq 1$, then $f'(x)$ is **never** a unit; rather, $f'(x)$ is a **nilpotent** element in $R[x]$.",

A polynomial $f(x) = a_0 + a_1x + \\dots + a_nx^n \\in R[x]$ is a unit (invertible) in $R[x]$ if and only if:\n1.  $a_0$ is a unit in $R$.\n2.  $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ are nilpotent elements in $R$.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the Premises\n\nLet $f(x) = a_n x^n + \\dots + a_1 x + a_0$ be a polynomial of degree $n \\geq 1$.\nAssume $f(x)$ is a unit in $R[x]$. Applying the theorem above:\n*   The coefficient $a_1$ is a nilpotent element in $R$.\n\nNow consider the formal derivative of $f(x)$:\n$$f'(x) = na_n x^{n-1} + \\dots + 2a_2 x + a_1$$\n\nThe constant term of $f'(x)$ is $a_1$.\n\n### 3. Logical Contradiction\n\nFor $f'(x)$ to be a unit in $R[x]$, its constant term must be a unit in $R$ (by the same theorem). Therefore, for the claim in the question to hold, $a_1$ would have to be a unit in $R$.\n\nHowever, from the premises, we established that $a_1$ is **nilpotent**.\nLet us check if an element can be both nilpotent and a unit.\n*   Let $x \\in R$ be nilpotent. Then $x^k = 0$ for some integer $k \\geq 1$.\n*   Let $x \\in R$ be a unit. Then there exists $v \\in R$ such that $xv = 1$.\n\nIf $x$ is both, we have:\n$$1 = 1^k = (xv)^k = x^k v^k = 0 \\cdot v^k = 0$$\nThis implies $1_R = 0_R$.\nThe problem explicitly states $1_R \\neq 0_R$. Thus, no element in $R$ can be both a unit and nilpotent.\n\n**Conclusion:** Since $a_1$ must be nilpotent (because $f$ is a unit) and cannot be a unit, the constant term of $f'(x)$ is not a unit. Therefore, **$f'(x)$ cannot be a unit in $R[x]$.**\n\n### 4. Concrete Counterexample\n\nTo demonstrate that the statement is false, we construct a specific example satisfying all premises but failing the conclusion.\n\n**Construction:**\n*   Let $R = \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ (the integers modulo 4). This is a commutative ring with $1 \\neq 0$.\n*   Let $f(x) = 1 + 2x \\in R[x]$.\n    *   Here $n=1$, satisfying $n \\geq 1$.\n    *   $f(x)$ is non-zero.\n\n**Verification of Hypothesis:**\nWe check if $f(x)$ is a unit in $\\mathbb{Z}_4[x]$ by computing its square:\n$$f(x)^2 = (1 + 2x)(1 + 2x) = 1 + 2x + 2x + 4x^2 = 1 + 4x + 0 = 1$$\nSince $f(x) \\cdot f(x) = 1$, $f(x)$ is a unit. (Alternatively, $a_0=1$ is a unit and $a_1=2$ is nilpotent since $2^2=0$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_4$).\n\n**Verification of Conclusion:**\nCompute the derivative $f'(x)$:\n$$f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(1 + 2x) = 2$$\nIs $f'(x) = 2$ a unit in $\\mathbb{Z}_4[x]$?\nFor $2$ to be a unit, there must exist a polynomial $g(x)$ such that $2 \\cdot g(x) = 1$. Looking at the constant terms, we would need $2 \\cdot b_0 = 1$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_4$.\nChecking the multiplication table for $\\mathbb{Z}_4$:\n*   $2 \\cdot 0 = 0$\n*   $2 \\cdot 1 = 2$\n*   $2 \\cdot 2 = 0$\n*   $2 \\cdot 3 = 2$\nThere is no solution to $2b_0 = 1$. Thus, $2$ is not a unit.\n\n**Result:** $f(x)$ is a unit, but $f'(x)$ is not. The statement is false.\n\n### 5. Correct Classification of $f'(x)$\n\nWhile $f'(x)$ is not a unit, we can rigorously prove what it *is*. Since $f(x)$ is a unit, all coefficients $a_1, \\dots, a_n$ are nilpotent. The coefficients of $f'(x)$ are $k a_k$ (integer multiples of these coefficients). In a commutative ring, the set of nilpotent elements forms an ideal (the nilradical). Therefore, any linear combination of nilpotent elements is nilpotent.\nThus, if $f(x)$ is a unit, **$f'(x)$ is a nilpotent element** in $R[x]$.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe statement is **false**. If $f(x)$ is a unit in $R[x]$ with $\\deg(f) \\geq 1$, then $f'(x)$ is **never** a unit; rather, $f'(x)$ is a **nilpotent** element in $R[x]$.",

Irreducibility of $f(x)$**\nTo determine the Galois group, we check if $f(x)$ is irreducible.\nUsing the substitution $x = y - 1$, we examine the polynomial for $y$:\n$$ P(y-1) = (y-1)^7 - 7(y-1) - 6 $$\n$$ = y^7 - 7y^6 + 21y^5 - 35y^4 + 35y^3 - 21y^2 + 7y - 1 - 7y + 7 - 6 $$\n$$ = y^7 - 7y^6 + 21y^5 - 35y^4 + 35y^3 - 21y^2 $$\n$$ = y^2 (y^5 - 7y^4 + 21y^3 - 35y^2 + 35y - 21) $$\nThe factor $y^2$ corresponds to the double root at $x=-1$. The remaining factor corresponds to $f(x)$. Let $h(y) = y^5 - 7y^4 + 21y^3 - 35y^2 + 35y - 21$.\nWe apply **Eisenstein's Criterion** with the prime $p=7$:\n- The leading coefficient $1$ is not divisible by $7$.\n- All other coefficients ($-7, 21, -35, 35, -21$) are divisible by $7$.\n- The constant term $-21$ is not divisible by $7^2 = 49$.\nThus, $h(y)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Consequently, $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**3. The Galois Group $G$**\nSince $f(x)$ is an irreducible polynomial of degree 5, its Galois group $G$ is a transitive subgroup of $S_5$.

It swaps the conjugate pairs and fixes the real root, yielding the cycle type $(2,2,1)$. This type exists in both $S_5$ and $F_{20}$, so it does not distinguish them.\nHowever, considering the coefficients and the lack of solvability constraints, $f(x)$ is a generic irreducible quintic with non-square discriminant.

It is irreducible.\n*   For $x+2$, $\\gcd(1, 2) = 1$. It is irreducible.\n\nSince $\\mathbb{Z}[x]$ is a Unique Factorization Domain (UFD), irreducible elements are prime elements. Thus, $x-2$ and $x+2$ are prime elements in $R$.\n\n### 3. Analysis of Prime Ideals\n\nLet $P_1 = \\langle x - 2 \\rangle$ and $P_2 = \\langle x + 2 \\rangle$. Since $x-2$ and $x+2$ are prime elements, $P_1$ and $P_2$ are prime ideals.\n\nWe verify this by considering the quotient rings:\n*   $R/P_1 = \\mathbb{Z}[x]/\\langle x-2 \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. Since $\\mathbb{Z}$ is an integral domain, $P_1$ is a prime ideal.\n*   $R/P_2 = \\mathbb{Z}[x]/\\langle x+2 \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. Since $\\mathbb{Z}$ is an integral domain, $P_2$ is a prime ideal.\n\nSince $x^2 - 4 = (x-2)(x+2)$, the ideal $I$ is contained in both $P_1$ and $P_2$. Thus, $I \\subseteq P_1 \\cap P_2$.\n\n### 4. Computing the Radical\n\nIn a UFD, if an ideal is generated by an element $f$ with prime factorization $f = u p_1^{e_1} \\cdots p_k^{e_k}$, the radical of the ideal is generated by the product of the distinct prime factors: $\\sqrt{\\langle f \\rangle} = \\langle p_1 \\cdots p_k \\rangle$.\n\nHere, $f = x^2 - 4 = (x-2)^1 (x+2)^1$. The exponents are both 1.\nTherefore:\n$$ \\sqrt{I} = \\langle (x-2)(x+2) \\rangle = \\langle x^2 - 4 \\rangle = I $$\n\nAlternatively, using the intersection of prime ideals:\n$$ \\sqrt{I} = \\sqrt{P_1 \\cap P_2} = \\sqrt{P_1} \\cap \\sqrt{P_2} $$\nSince $P_1$ and $P_2$ are prime ideals, they are radical ideals (i.e., $\\sqrt{P} = P$).\n$$ \\sqrt{I} = P_1 \\cap P_2 = \\langle x-2 \\rangle \\cap \\langle x+2 \\rangle $$\n\nTo find this intersection explicitly: Let $g \\in \\langle x-2 \\rangle \\cap \\langle x+2 \\rangle$.\nThen $x-2$ divides $g$ and $x+2$ divides $g$.\nSince $x-2$ and $x+2$ are non-associated prime elements (their ratio is not a unit in $\\mathbb{Z}[x]$), their least common multiple is their product.\nThus, $(x-2)(x+2)$ divides $g$.\n$$ g \\in \\langle (x-2)(x+2) \\rangle = \\langle x^2 - 4 \\rangle $$\nThis confirms that $P_1 \\cap P_2 = I$.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nSince the generator $x^2 - 4$ is square-free (it has no repeated irreducible factors) in the UFD $\\mathbb{Z}[x]$, the ideal $I$ is a radical ideal.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe radical of the ideal $I = \\langle x^2 - 4 \\rangle$ in $R = \\mathbb{Z}[x]$ is the ideal itself:\n$$ \\sqrt{I} = \\langle x^2 - 4 \\rangle $$",

Verification of Conclusion**\n\nThe question asks to prove that for any $x \\in R$, $x^2 = x$.\nTesting this in our counterexample $R = \\mathbb{Z}$:\nLet $x = 2$.\n$$x^2 = 2^2 = 4$$\n$$x = 2$$\nSince $4 \\neq 2$, the statement $x^2 = x$ is **false** for $x=2$.\n\n### Mathematical Analysis\n\nThe given properties essentially state that $a$ is a **central idempotent** that associates with all elements in a specific way.\n1.  $ax = xa$ states that $a$ commutes with all elements.\n2.  $(xy)a = x(ya)$, combined with commutativity, implies associativity involving $a$: $(xy)a = a(xy) = x(ay)$. This places $a$ in the nucleus of the ring (specifically, it ensures associativity for triples involving $a$).\n3.  $a^2 = a$ states that $a$ is idempotent.\n\nIn standard associative rings (like $\\mathbb{Z}$), any central idempotent satisfies these conditions. The existence of a central idempotent (like $0$ or $1$) does not imply that every element in the ring is idempotent (i.e., that the ring is Boolean). The conclusion $x^2 = x$ defines a Boolean ring, which is a very specific and restrictive class of rings (necessarily of characteristic 2 and commutative). Most rings, including the integers, rationals, and reals, do not satisfy this property despite possessing elements $a$ (like 0 or 1) that satisfy the premises.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe theorem to be proved is false. Therefore, the question is ill-posed as it violates the correctness requirement by asking to prove an invalid implication.",

Proof of Well-Definedness\n\nWe must show that the definition $\\psi([p]) = [\\phi(p)]$ does not depend on the choice of the representative projection $p$.\n\nLet $p \\in M_n(A)$ and $q \\in M_m(A)$ be projections representing the same class in $K_0(A)$. That is, $[p] = [q]$.\nBy the definition of $K_0(A)$, this implies $p$ and $q$ are stably equivalent.

Proof that $\\psi$ is a Group Homomorphism\n\nWe must show that $\\psi$ preserves the group operation. Let $[p], [q] \\in K_0(A)$. The group operation in $K_0(A)$ is defined via the direct sum of projections:\n$$ [p] + [q] = [p \\oplus q] = \\left[ \\begin{pmatrix} p & 0 \\\\ 0 & q \\end{pmatrix} \\right] $$\nApply $\\psi$ to the sum:\n$$ \\psi([p] + [q]) = \\psi([p \\oplus q]) = [(p \\oplus q) \\otimes 1_X] $$\nObserve the structure of the tensor product with the identity function:\n$$ (p \\oplus q) \\otimes 1_X = \\begin{pmatrix} p & 0 \\\\ 0 & q \\end{pmatrix} \\otimes 1_X = \\begin{pmatrix} p \\otimes 1_X & 0 \\\\ 0 & q \\otimes 1_X \\end{pmatrix} $$\nIn the target group $K(X, A)$, the class of a block diagonal projection is the sum of the classes of the diagonal blocks:\n$$ \\left[ \\begin{pmatrix} p \\otimes 1_X & 0 \\\\ 0 & q \\otimes 1_X \\end{pmatrix} \\right] = [p \\otimes 1_X] + [q \\otimes 1_X] $$\nSubstituting the definition of $\\psi$ back in:\n$$ [p \\otimes 1_X] + [q \\otimes 1_X] = \\psi([p]) + \\psi([q]) $$\nTherefore, $\\psi([p] + [q]) = \\psi([p]) + \\psi([q])$.\n\n**Extension to the full Grothendieck Group:**\nGenerally, an element $g \\in K_0(A)$ is of the form $g = [p] - [q]$. The map $\\psi$ extends to the whole group by defining $\\psi([p] - [q]) = \\psi([p]) - \\psi([q])$. The additivity shown above ensures this extension is consistent (independent of the representation of $g$ as a difference).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe map $\\psi$ is induced by the unital *-homomorphism $\\phi: A \\to \\mathcal{B}$ defined by $a \\mapsto a \\otimes 1_X$. By the functoriality of $K_0$, any *-homomorphism induces a well-defined group homomorphism on the $K_0$ groups.

There exist integers $k, l$ and a partial isometry $v \\in M_{N}(A)$ (where $N$ is sufficiently large to contain the padded matrices) such that:\n$$ v^*v = p \\oplus 0_k \\quad \\text{and} \\quad vv^* = q \\oplus 0_l $$\nwhere $0_k$ and $0_l$ are zero matrices of size $k$ and $l$.\n\nNow, we extend the *-homomorphism $\\phi$ to matrices over $A$, denoted $\\phi_N: M_N(A) \\to M_N(\\mathcal{B})$, by applying $\\phi$ entry-wise. Since $\\phi$ is a *-homomorphism, $\\phi_N$ is also a *-homomorphism.\n\nApply $\\phi_N$ to the equivalence relations:\n1.  $\\phi_N(v^*v) = \\phi_N(v)^*\\phi_N(v)$.\n2.  $\\phi_N(p \\oplus 0_k) = \\phi_N(p) \\oplus \\phi_N(0_k) = (p \\otimes 1_X) \\oplus 0_k$.\n3.  $\\phi_N(vv^*) = \\phi_N(v)\\phi_N(v)^*$.\n4.  $\\phi_N(q \\oplus 0_l) = \\phi_N(q) \\oplus \\phi_N(0_l) = (q \\otimes 1_X) \\oplus 0_l$.\n\nLet $W = \\phi_N(v)$. Then:\n$$ W^*W = (p \\otimes 1_X) \\oplus 0_k $$\n$$ WW^* = (q \\otimes 1_X) \\oplus 0_l $$\nThis shows that $(p \\otimes 1_X) \\oplus 0_k$ is Murray-von Neumann equivalent to $(q \\otimes 1_X) \\oplus 0_l$ in $M_\\infty(\\mathcal{B})$.\nConsequently, they define the same class in $K_0(\\mathcal{B}) = K(X, A)$.\n$$ [p \\otimes 1_X] = [q \\otimes 1_X] $$\nThus, $\\psi$ is well-defined.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Proof that $\\psi$ is a Group Homomorphism\n\nWe must show that $\\psi$ preserves the group operation. Let $[p], [q] \\in K_0(A)$. The group operation in $K_0(A)$ is defined via the direct sum of projections:\n$$ [p] + [q] = [p \\oplus q] = \\left[ \\begin{pmatrix} p & 0 \\\\ 0 & q \\end{pmatrix} \\right] $$\nApply $\\psi$ to the sum:\n$$ \\psi([p] + [q]) = \\psi([p \\oplus q]) = [(p \\oplus q) \\otimes 1_X] $$\nObserve the structure of the tensor product with the identity function:\n$$ (p \\oplus q) \\otimes 1_X = \\begin{pmatrix} p & 0 \\\\ 0 & q \\end{pmatrix} \\otimes 1_X = \\begin{pmatrix} p \\otimes 1_X & 0 \\\\ 0 & q \\otimes 1_X \\end{pmatrix} $$\nIn the target group $K(X, A)$, the class of a block diagonal projection is the sum of the classes of the diagonal blocks:\n$$ \\left[ \\begin{pmatrix} p \\otimes 1_X & 0 \\\\ 0 & q \\otimes 1_X \\end{pmatrix} \\right] = [p \\otimes 1_X] + [q \\otimes 1_X] $$\nSubstituting the definition of $\\psi$ back in:\n$$ [p \\otimes 1_X] + [q \\otimes 1_X] = \\psi([p]) + \\psi([q]) $$\nTherefore, $\\psi([p] + [q]) = \\psi([p]) + \\psi([q])$.\n\n**Extension to the full Grothendieck Group:**\nGenerally, an element $g \\in K_0(A)$ is of the form $g = [p] - [q]$. The map $\\psi$ extends to the whole group by defining $\\psi([p] - [q]) = \\psi([p]) - \\psi([q])$. The additivity shown above ensures this extension is consistent (independent of the representation of $g$ as a difference).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe map $\\psi$ is induced by the unital *-homomorphism $\\phi: A \\to \\mathcal{B}$ defined by $a \\mapsto a \\otimes 1_X$. By the functoriality of $K_0$, any *-homomorphism induces a well-defined group homomorphism on the $K_0$ groups. We have explicitly verified that $\\psi$ respects the equivalence relation (well-definedness) and the addition operation (homomorphism property).\n\n**Final Result:** $\\psi$ is a well-defined group homomorphism.",

Determine $f(x)$ and the Constant $c$\n\nSubstituting $g(x) = cx$ back into the expression for $f(x)$, we have:\n$$f(x) = x^2 + cx$$\n\nWe are given the initial condition $f(1) = 3$. We use this to solve for $c$:\n$$f(1) = 1^2 + c(1)$$\n$$3 = 1 + c$$\n$$c = 2$$\n\nThus, the function is explicitly:\n$$f(x) = x^2 + 2x$$\n\n### 5. Verification\n\nWe verify that $f(x) = x^2 + 2x$ satisfies the original conditions.\n\n**Functional Equation:**\nLHS:\n$$f(x+y) = (x+y)^2 + 2(x+y) = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 + 2x + 2y$$\nRHS:\n$$f(x) + f(y) + 2xy = (x^2 + 2x) + (y^2 + 2y) + 2xy = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy + 2x + 2y$$\nLHS = RHS. The equation holds.\n\n**Initial Condition:**\n$$f(1) = 1^2 + 2(1) = 3$$\nThe condition holds.\n\n**Continuity:**\nThe function $f(x) = x^2 + 2x$ is a polynomial, which is continuous everywhere.\n\n### 6. Calculate $f(2022)$\n\nNow we compute the value for $x = 2022$:\n$$f(2022) = (2022)^2 + 2(2022)$$\n\nFactor out 2022:\n$$f(2022) = 2022(2022 + 2) = 2022 \\times 2024$$\n\nWe can compute this product using the difference of squares with the midpoint 2023:\n$$2022 \\times 2024 = (2023 - 1)(2023 + 1) = 2023^2 - 1$$\n\nCalculating $2023^2$:\n$$2023^2 = (2000 + 23)^2 = 2000^2 + 2(2000)(23) + 23^2$$\n$$= 4,000,000 + 92,000 + 529$$\n$$= 4,092,529$$\n\nSubtracting 1:\n$$f(2022) = 4,092,529 - 1 = 4,092,528$$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe value of $f(2022)$ is **4,092,528**.",

Then $du = (1 - 2x) dx$ and $v = -\\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\cos(n\\pi x)$.\n$$ I_n = \\left[ -\\frac{x-x^2}{n\\pi} \\cos(n\\pi x) \\right]_0^1 + \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\int_0^1 (1-2x) \\cos(n\\pi x) \\, dx $$\nThe boundary term vanishes at both $x=0$ and $x=1$.\nNow compute the remaining integral: $\\int_0^1 (1-2x) \\cos(n\\pi x) \\, dx$.\nLet $u = 1 - 2x$ and $dv = \\cos(n\\pi x) dx$. Then $du = -2 dx$ and $v = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\sin(n\\pi x)$.\n$$ \\int_0^1 (1-2x) \\cos(n\\pi x) \\, dx = \\left[ \\frac{1-2x}{n\\pi} \\sin(n\\pi x) \\right]_0^1 - \\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\sin(n\\pi x) (-2) \\, dx $$\nThe boundary term vanishes since $\\sin(n\\pi) = \\sin(0) = 0$.\nThe remaining term is:\n$$ \\frac{2}{n\\pi} \\int_0^1 \\sin(n\\pi x) \\, dx = \\frac{2}{n\\pi} \\left[ -\\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\cos(n\\pi x) \\right]_0^1 = -\\frac{2}{(n\\pi)^2} (\\cos(n\\pi) - \\cos(0)) $$\nSubstituting back into the expression for $I_n$:\n$$ I_n = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\left( -\\frac{2}{(n\\pi)^2} ((-1)^n - 1) \\right) = \\frac{2}{(n\\pi)^3} (1 - (-1)^n) $$\n- If $n$ is **even**, $1 - (-1)^n = 0$, so $I_n = 0$.\n- If $n$ is **odd**, $1 - (-1)^n = 2$, so $I_n = \\frac{4}{(n\\pi)^3}$.\n\nThus, the coefficient $A_{nm}$ is non-zero only when both $n$ and $m$ are odd.\n$$ A_{nm} = 4 \\times \\frac{4}{(n\\pi)^3} \\times \\frac{4}{(m\\pi)^3} = \\frac{64}{\\pi^6 n^3 m^3} $$\n\n### 5. Final Solution\n\nSubstituting the coefficients back into the series, the solution is:\n\n$$ u(x, y, t) = \\sum_{\\substack{n=1 \\\\ n \\text{ odd}}}^{\\infty} \\sum_{\\substack{m=1 \\\\ m \\text{ odd}}}^{\\infty} \\frac{64}{\\pi^6 n^3 m^3} \\sin(n\\pi x) \\sin(m\\pi y) e^{-k \\pi^2 (n^2 + m^2) t} $$\n\nThis can be written explicitly by replacing $n$ with $2i-1$ and $m$ with $2j-1$:\n\n$$ u(x, y, t) = \\frac{64}{\\pi^6} \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(2i-1)^3 (2j-1)^3} \\sin((2i-1)\\pi x) \\sin((2j-1)\\pi y) e^{-k \\pi^2 ((2i-1)^2 + (2j-1)^2) t} $$",

Finding an Explicit Formula for $a_n$\n\nLet us write out the first few terms using the recurrence relation:\n- For $n=1$: $a_2 = \\frac{1}{2}a_1 + \\frac{1}{1}$\n- For $n=2$: $a_3 = \\frac{1}{2}a_2 + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}a_1 + 1\\right) + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}a_1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}$\n- For $n=3$: $a_4 = \\frac{1}{2}a_3 + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{4}a_1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{8}a_1 + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{3}$\n\nWe can observe a pattern. By applying the recurrence relation repeatedly, we can express $a_n$ in terms of $a_1$ and a summation.\n$$\na_n = \\frac{1}{2}a_{n-1} + \\frac{1}{n-1}\n$$\n$$\na_n = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}a_{n-2} + \\frac{1}{n-2}\\right) + \\frac{1}{n-1} = \\frac{1}{4}a_{n-2} + \\frac{1}{2(n-2)} + \\frac{1}{n-1}\n$$\nContinuing this process back to $a_1$, we obtain the general formula for $n \\ge 2$:\n$$\na_n = \\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}a_1 + \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\frac{1}{2^{n-1-k}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{k}\n$$\nSubstituting $a_1 = 1$:\n$$\na_n = \\frac{1}{2^{n-1}} + \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\frac{1}{k \\cdot 2^{n-1-k}}\n$$\n\n### 2. Evaluating the Limit\n\nWe want to find $L = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} a_n$.\n$$\nL = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left( \\frac{1}{2^{n-1}} + \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\frac{1}{k \\cdot 2^{n-1-k}} \\right)\n$$\nThe first term, $\\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}$, clearly approaches $0$ as $n \\to \\infty$.\nWe must analyze the summation term $S_n = \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\frac{1}{k \\cdot 2^{n-1-k}}$.\n\nLet $\\epsilon > 0$ be an arbitrary positive number. We will show that there exists an $N_0$ such that for all $n > N_0$, $0 < S_n < \\epsilon$.\n\nSince $\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{k} = 0$, there exists an integer $K$ such that for all $k > K$, $\\frac{1}{k} < \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}$.\nFor $n > K + 1$, we split the sum $S_n$ into two parts: the \"head\" (terms $1$ to $K$) and the \"tail\" (terms $K+1$ to $n-1$).\n\n$$\nS_n = \\underbrace{\\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\frac{1}{k \\cdot 2^{n-1-k}}}_{\\text{Head}} + \\underbrace{\\sum_{k=K+1}^{n-1} \\frac{1}{k \\cdot 2^{n-1-k}}}_{\\text{Tail}}\n$$\n\n**Analyze the Tail:**\nFor $k > K$, we have $\\frac{1}{k} < \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}$. Thus:\n$$\n\\text{Tail} < \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} \\sum_{k=K+1}^{n-1} \\frac{1}{2^{n-1-k}}\n$$\nLet $j = n-1-k$. As $k$ goes from $K+1$ to $n-1$, $j$ goes from $n-K-2$ down to $0$. The sum is a partial sum of a geometric series with ratio $1/2$:\n$$\n\\sum_{k=K+1}^{n-1} \\frac{1}{2^{n-1-k}} = \\sum_{j=0}^{n-K-2} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^j < \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^j = 2\n$$\nTherefore:\n$$\n\\text{Tail} < \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} \\cdot 2 = \\frac{\\epsilon}{2}\n$$\n\n**Analyze the Head:**\nThe sum $\\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\frac{2^k}{k}$ is a constant value $C_K$ independent of $n$. We can rewrite the head as:\n$$\n\\text{Head} = \\frac{1}{2^{n-1}} \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\frac{2^k}{k} = \\frac{C_K}{2^{n-1}}\n$$\nSince $C_K$ is fixed and $2^{n-1} \\to \\infty$, there exists an integer $M$ such that for all $n > M$, $\\frac{C_K}{2^{n-1}} < \\frac{\\epsilon}{2}$.\n\n**Conclusion for the Sum:**\nFor all $n > \\max(K+1, M)$, we have:\n$$\nS_n = \\text{Head} + \\text{Tail} < \\frac{\\epsilon}{2} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{2} = \\epsilon\n$$\nSince $S_n > 0$ (all terms are positive), this proves that $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} S_n = 0$.\n\n### 3.

Verification**\nFor any $\\xi \\in V$, we have the uniform bound on $K$:\n$$ |\\chi(\\xi, x) - \\chi(\\xi_0, x)| < \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\|f\\|_1} \\quad \\text{for all } x \\in K. $$\n\nSubstitute this back into our integral estimate from Step 2:\n$$ |\\widehat{f}(\\xi) - \\widehat{f}(\\xi_0)| \\le \\int_{K} |f(x)| \\left| \\chi(\\xi, x) - \\chi(\\xi_0, x) \\right| \\, dx $$\n$$ < \\int_{K} |f(x)| \\cdot \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\|f\\|_1} \\, dx $$\n$$ = \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\|f\\|_1} \\int_{K} |f(x)| \\, dx $$\n$$ = \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\|f\\|_1} \\cdot \\|f\\|_1 = \\epsilon. $$\n\n**Conclusion**\nWe have shown that for any $\\xi_0 \\in \\widehat{G}$ and any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a neighborhood $V$ of $\\xi_0$ such that $\\xi \\in V$ implies $|\\widehat{f}(\\xi) - \\widehat{f}(\\xi_0)| < \\epsilon$. Therefore, $\\widehat{f}$ is continuous at every point $\\xi_0 \\in \\widehat{G}$, and thus continuous on $\\widehat{G}$.",

A subset of a normed space is closed if and only if it contains the limit of every convergent sequence of its elements.\n\n### 1. Sequential Characterization Strategy\n\nLet $\\{x_n\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ be a sequence of elements in $C$ that converges to a limit $x$ in $X$. Formally:\n$$ x_n \\in C \\quad \\text{for all } n \\geq 1, $$\n$$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} x_n = x \\quad \\text{in the norm topology of } X. $$\nTo prove that $C$ is closed, we must show that the limit $x$ is also in $C$. That is, we must verify the condition:\n$$ \\|Tx\\| = 2\\|x\\|. $$\n\n### 2. Continuity of the Norm and the Operator\n\nWe rely on the following continuity properties:\n\n**A. Continuity of the Operator $T$**\nSince $T: X \\to X$ is a **bounded** linear operator, it is continuous. By the sequential definition of continuity, if $x_n \\to x$, then:\n$$ Tx_n \\to Tx. $$\n\n**B. Continuity of the Norm $\\|\\cdot\\|$**\nThe norm function $\\|\\cdot\\|: X \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is continuous. This is a consequence of the reverse triangle inequality: $|\\|u\\| - \\|v\\|| \\le \\|u - v\\|$. Thus, for any sequence $z_n \\to z$ in $X$:\n$$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\|z_n\\| = \\|z\\|. $$\n\n### 3. Proof Execution\n\nSince $x_n \\in C$ for all $n$, the defining property of $C$ holds for each term in the sequence:\n$$ \\|Tx_n\\| = 2\\|x_n\\|. $$\n\nWe take the limit as $n \\to \\infty$ on both sides of this equation.\n\n**Left-hand side:**\nSince $T$ is continuous, $x_n \\to x$ implies $Tx_n \\to Tx$. Since the norm is continuous, the convergence $Tx_n \\to Tx$ implies:\n$$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\|Tx_n\\| = \\|Tx\\|. $$\n\n**Right-hand side:**\nSince the norm is continuous, $x_n \\to x$ implies $\\|x_n\\| \\to \\|x\\|$. Therefore:\n$$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} 2\\|x_n\\| = 2\\|x\\|. $$\n\n**Conclusion of the Limit Step:**\nSince limits are unique and algebraic operations (equality) are preserved under limits, we equate the results:\n$$ \\|Tx\\| = 2\\|x\\|. $$\n\n### 4.

Continuity of the Operator $T$**\nSince $T: X \\to X$ is a **bounded** linear operator, it is continuous.

This is a consequence of the reverse triangle inequality: $|\\|u\\| - \\|v\\|| \\le \\|u - v\\|$. Thus, for any sequence $z_n \\to z$ in $X$:\n$$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\|z_n\\| = \\|z\\|. $$\n\n### 3.

Since the norm is continuous, the convergence $Tx_n \\to Tx$ implies:\n$$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\|Tx_n\\| = \\|Tx\\|. $$\n\n**Right-hand side:**\nSince the norm is continuous, $x_n \\to x$ implies $\\|x_n\\| \\to \\|x\\|$.

Applying Boundary Conditions\n\nWe determine the constants $A$ and $B$ using the given boundary conditions $y(0) = 0$ and $y(1) = 1$.\n\n**Condition 1:** $y(0) = 0$\nUsing the hyperbolic form:\n$$ y(0) = A \\cosh(0) + B \\sinh(0) $$\nSince $\\cosh(0) = 1$ and $\\sinh(0) = 0$, we have:\n$$ 0 = A(1) + B(0) \\implies A = 0 $$\n\nThus, the solution simplifies to:\n$$ y(x) = B \\sinh x $$\n\n**Condition 2:** $y(1) = 1$\n$$ y(1) = B \\sinh(1) $$\n$$ 1 = B \\sinh(1) $$\n$$ B = \\frac{1}{\\sinh(1)} $$\n\nSubstituting $A$ and $B$ back into the general solution, we find the extremal function:\n$$ y(x) = \\frac{\\sinh x}{\\sinh 1} $$\n\n### 4. Verification of Minimality\n\nTo ensure this stationary function is indeed a minimizer, we examine the second variation or the convexity of the Lagrangian.\n\nThe Lagrangian $L(y, y') = y^2 + (y')^2$ is a strictly convex function of the variables $y$ and $y'$ because the Hessian matrix with respect to $y$ and $y'$ is:\n$$ H = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial^2 L}{\\partial y^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 L}{\\partial y \\partial y'} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial^2 L}{\\partial y' \\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial^2 L}{\\partial y'^2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis matrix is positive definite (eigenvalues are both 2). Since the Lagrangian is strictly convex in $y$ and $y'$, the functional $J[y]$ is strictly convex. Therefore, any function $y(x)$ that satisfies the Euler-Lagrange equation and the boundary conditions is the unique global minimizer.\n\nAdditionally, the Legendre condition for a minimum requires $\\frac{\\partial^2 L}{\\partial y'^2} \\geq 0$. Here, $\\frac{\\partial^2 L}{\\partial y'^2} = 2 > 0$, which is satisfied strictly everywhere.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe function $y(x)$ that minimizes the functional is:\n$$ y(x) = \\frac{\\sinh x}{\\sinh 1} $$\n\nOr, expressed in terms of exponentials:\n$$ y(x) = \\frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{e - e^{-1}} $$",

        "answer": "The statement is **False**.\n\n### Justification\n\nThe statement asserts that every topological space possesses the property of **normality** (specifically, that disjoint closed sets can be separated by disjoint open sets). While many familiar spaces (such as metric spaces and compact Hausdorff spaces) satisfy this property, it is not true for all topological spaces.\n\nTo prove the statement is false, we provide a rigorous counterexample: a specific topological space $X$ and two disjoint closed sets $A, B \\subseteq X$ that cannot be separated by disjoint open sets.\n\n### Counterexample: The Particular Point Topology\n\nConsider the set $X = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$. We define a topology $\\mathcal{T}$ on $X$ by declaring that a subset $U \\subseteq X$ is open if and only if $3 \\in U$ or $U = \\varnothing$. This is known as the **particular point topology** on $X$ (with particular point $3$).\n\n**1. Verification of Topology**\nLet's verify $\\mathcal{T} = \\{\\varnothing, \\{3\\}, \\{1, 3\\}, \\{2, 3\\}, \\{1, 2, 3\\}\\}$ is a topology:\n*   $\\varnothing$ and $X$ are in $\\mathcal{T}$.\n*   The union of any collection of sets in $\\mathcal{T}$ contains $3$ (unless all are empty), so it is in $\\mathcal{T}$.\n*   The intersection of any finite collection of sets in $\\mathcal{T}$ contains $3$ (unless one is empty), so it is in $\\mathcal{T}$.\n\n**2. Identification of Closed Sets**\nA set $C$ is closed if and only if its complement $X \\setminus C$ is open.\n*   $X \\setminus \\{1\\} = \\{2, 3\\}$, which is open. Therefore, **$\\{1\\}$ is closed**.\n*   $X \\setminus \\{2\\} = \\{1, 3\\}$, which is open. Therefore, **$\\{2\\}$ is closed**.\n\n**3. Selection of Disjoint Closed Sets**\nLet $A = \\{1\\}$ and $B = \\{2\\}$.\n*   $A$ and $B$ are closed sets, as shown above.\n*   $A \\cap B = \\{1\\} \\cap \\{2\\} = \\varnothing$.\nThus, the hypothesis of the statement is satisfied.\n\n**4. Analysis of Open Sets**\nWe must test if there exist disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $A \\subseteq U$ and $B \\subseteq V$.\n*   Since $A \\subseteq U$, we have $\\{1\\} \\subseteq U$. Since $U$ is non-empty and open, it must contain the particular point $3$. Thus, $\\{1, 3\\} \\subseteq U$.\n*   Since $B \\subseteq V$, we have $\\{2\\} \\subseteq V$. Since $V$ is non-empty and open, it must contain the particular point $3$. Thus, $\\{2, 3\\} \\subseteq V$.\n\n**5. Intersection Check**\nBoth $U$ and $V$ must contain the element $3$.

        "raw_answer": "The statement is **False**.\n\n### Justification\n\nThe statement asserts that every topological space possesses the property of **normality** (specifically, that disjoint closed sets can be separated by disjoint open sets). While many familiar spaces (such as metric spaces and compact Hausdorff spaces) satisfy this property, it is not true for all topological spaces.\n\nTo prove the statement is false, we provide a rigorous counterexample: a specific topological space $X$ and two disjoint closed sets $A, B \\subseteq X$ that cannot be separated by disjoint open sets.\n\n### Counterexample: The Particular Point Topology\n\nConsider the set $X = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$. We define a topology $\\mathcal{T}$ on $X$ by declaring that a subset $U \\subseteq X$ is open if and only if $3 \\in U$ or $U = \\varnothing$. This is known as the **particular point topology** on $X$ (with particular point $3$).\n\n**1. Verification of Topology**\nLet's verify $\\mathcal{T} = \\{\\varnothing, \\{3\\}, \\{1, 3\\}, \\{2, 3\\}, \\{1, 2, 3\\}\\}$ is a topology:\n*   $\\varnothing$ and $X$ are in $\\mathcal{T}$.\n*   The union of any collection of sets in $\\mathcal{T}$ contains $3$ (unless all are empty), so it is in $\\mathcal{T}$.\n*   The intersection of any finite collection of sets in $\\mathcal{T}$ contains $3$ (unless one is empty), so it is in $\\mathcal{T}$.\n\n**2. Identification of Closed Sets**\nA set $C$ is closed if and only if its complement $X \\setminus C$ is open.\n*   $X \\setminus \\{1\\} = \\{2, 3\\}$, which is open. Therefore, **$\\{1\\}$ is closed**.\n*   $X \\setminus \\{2\\} = \\{1, 3\\}$, which is open. Therefore, **$\\{2\\}$ is closed**.\n\n**3. Selection of Disjoint Closed Sets**\nLet $A = \\{1\\}$ and $B = \\{2\\}$.\n*   $A$ and $B$ are closed sets, as shown above.\n*   $A \\cap B = \\{1\\} \\cap \\{2\\} = \\varnothing$.\nThus, the hypothesis of the statement is satisfied.\n\n**4. Analysis of Open Sets**\nWe must test if there exist disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $A \\subseteq U$ and $B \\subseteq V$.\n*   Since $A \\subseteq U$, we have $\\{1\\} \\subseteq U$. Since $U$ is non-empty and open, it must contain the particular point $3$. Thus, $\\{1, 3\\} \\subseteq U$.\n*   Since $B \\subseteq V$, we have $\\{2\\} \\subseteq V$. Since $V$ is non-empty and open, it must contain the particular point $3$. Thus, $\\{2, 3\\} \\subseteq V$.\n\n**5. Intersection Check**\nBoth $U$ and $V$ must contain the element $3$. Therefore:\n$$ 3 \\in U \\cap V $$\nThis implies $U \\cap V \\neq \\varnothing$.\n\n### Conclusion\nIt is impossible to find disjoint open sets containing $A$ and $B$ respectively.

A **neighborhood** $U$ of a point $p$ is an open set in $M$ containing $p$. (Note: Neighborhoods are not required to be connected unless specified).\n2.  A topological space $X$ is **connected** if it cannot be written as the union of two disjoint, non-empty open sets.\n3.  The empty set $\\emptyset$ is trivially connected (it has no non-empty subsets to form a separation). Consequently, a space $X$ is **not connected** (disconnected) only if $X \\neq \\emptyset$ and $X$ admits a separation.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the Set $\\partial S$\n\nWe determine the membership of points $p \\in M$ in $\\partial S$ by analyzing the condition \"$\\exists U \\ni p$ such that $U \\cap S$ is not connected\".\n\n**Case 1: $p \\notin S$**\nIf $p \\in M \\setminus S$, there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $p$ such that $U \\cap S = \\emptyset$ (since $S$ is closed, its complement is open).\nThe intersection $U \\cap S = \\emptyset$ is connected.\nFurthermore, for *any* neighborhood $V$ of $p$, we can choose a smaller neighborhood $V' = V \\cap (M \\setminus S)$. Then $V' \\cap S = \\emptyset$, which is connected.\nDoes there exist *any* neighborhood $U$ such that $U \\cap S$ is not connected?\nIf $U$ is large enough to intersect $S$ in a disconnected way, then $U \\cap S$ is not connected.\nHowever, usually, boundary definitions focus on the local behavior or subsets of the set itself. Let us assume the standard interpretation where we examine the topological properties of the intersection.\nIf we allow $U$ to extend far from $p$ to capture a disconnected part of $S$, then $p$ could theoretically be in $\\partial S$.\n*However*, the most direct behavior of $\\partial S$ is governed by points in $S$. Let us check the behavior for $p \\in S$ first, as this often determines the set $\\partial S$.\n\n**Case 2: $p \\in S$**\nWe distinguish subcases based on the cardinality and structure of $S$.\n\n*Subcase 2a: $|S| > 1$ (S contains at least two distinct points)*\nLet $p \\in S$. Since $|S| > 1$, there exists a point $q \\in S$ such that $q \\neq p$.\nBecause $M$ is a manifold, it is a Hausdorff space. Therefore, there exist disjoint open neighborhoods $V_p$ of $p$ and $V_q$ of $q$.\nConstruct the set $U = V_p \\cup V_q$.\n1.  $U$ is an open set (union of open sets).\n2.  $p \\in U$ (since $p \\in V_p$).\nSo, $U$ is a neighborhood of $p$.\n\nNow consider the intersection $U \\cap S$:\n$$U \\cap S = (V_p \\cup V_q) \\cap S = (V_p \\cap S) \\cup (V_q \\cap S).$$\nLet $A = V_p \\cap S$ and $B = V_q \\cap S$.\n1.  $A$ and $B$ are disjoint (since $V_p$ and $V_q$ are disjoint).\n2.  $A \\neq \\emptyset$ (contains $p$) and $B \\neq \\emptyset$ (contains $q$).\n3.  $A$ and $B$ are open in the subspace topology of $U \\cap S$ (intersections of open sets with the subspace).\n\nThus, $U \\cap S$ is the union of two disjoint, non-empty open sets ($A$ and $B$). By definition, $U \\cap S$ is **not connected**.\nSince we found a neighborhood $U$ of $p$ such that $U \\cap S$ is not connected, we conclude $p \\in \\partial S$.\nThis holds for all $p \\in S$. Therefore, $S \\subseteq \\partial S$.\n\n*Subcase 2b: $|S| \\le 1$*\nIf $S = \\{p\\}$, then for any neighborhood $U$ of $p$, $U \\cap S = \\{p\\}$. A single point is connected. Thus $p \\notin \\partial S$. So $\\partial S = \\emptyset$.\nIf $S = \\emptyset$, then $\\partial S = \\emptyset$.\n\n**Refinement on $p \\notin S$:**\nIf we strictly follow the logic in Subcase 2a, for any $p \\notin S$, if $|S| \\ge 2$, we can form $U = V_p \\cup V_{S_{part1}} \\cup V_{S_{part2}}$. This would imply $\\partial S = M$.\nHowever, usually in such geometric contexts, if the condition requires $U \\cap S$ to be \"not connected\", and we consider the \"boundary of S\", the set is typically a subset of $S$.\nIf $\\partial S = M$, it is closed.\nIf $\\partial S = S$, it is closed.\nIf $\\partial S = \\emptyset$, it is closed.\n\nGiven the phrasing \"boundary of S\", it is most mathematically standard to interpret the result restricted to the closure of $S$. However, regardless of whether $\\partial S = M$ (via disconnected arbitrary neighborhoods) or $\\partial S = S$ (via some implicit locality constraint not stated but common in context), the set is closed.\n\nLet us proceed with the most restrictive (and geometrically meaningful) result derived from the Hausdorff property on $S$ itself.\nIf we assume the neighborhoods can be arbitrary open sets, then for $|S| \\ge 2$:\nFor any $r \\in M$ (whether in $S$ or not), take $q_1, q_2 \\in S$. Let $V_r, V_1, V_2$ be disjoint neighborhoods.\nLet $U = V_r \\cup V_1 \\cup V_2$. $U$ is a neighborhood of $r$.\n$U \\cap S = (V_1 \\cap S) \\cup (V_2 \\cap S)$. This is disconnected.\nThus, $r \\in \\partial S$.\nThis implies $\\partial S = M$.\nSince $M$ is a manifold, $M$ is a closed subset of itself.\nThus, $\\partial S$ is closed.\n\n**Considering \"Connected Neighborhoods\"**\nIf the problem implicitly implies $U$ must be a *connected* neighborhood (common in manifold theory, e.g., coordinate balls):\nThis would make the set $\\partial S$ much smaller (points of local disconnectedness).\nHowever, we must prove $\\partial S$ is closed based on the *given* text. The text does not specify \"connected neighborhood\".\nIn logical proofs, we do not add constraints.\nUnder the constraint of \"any neighborhood\", we proved $\\partial S$ is either $M$ (if $|S| \\ge 2$), $\\emptyset$ (if $|S| < 2$).\nBoth $M$ and $\\emptyset$ are closed sets.\n\nHowever, often such problems assume $S$ is the object and we look at $p \\in S$. Even if we restrict to $\\partial S \\subseteq S$, we found $\\partial S = S$ for $|S| \\ge 2$.\nSince $S$ is the zero set of a smooth function, $S$ is closed.\n\n### 3. Formal Proof\n\nWe verify that $\\partial S$ is closed by showing its complement is open or by identifying the set explicitly.\n\n**Proposition:** $\\partial S$ is a closed subset of $M$.\n\n**Proof:**\nSince $f$ is continuous, $S = f^{-1}(0)$ is a closed subset of $M$.\nIf $S$ contains fewer than 2 points, then for any open set $U$, $U \\cap S$ is either empty or a single point, both of which are connected. Thus $\\partial S = \\emptyset$, which is closed.\n\nAssume $S$ contains at least two distinct points $a$ and $b$.\nConsider any point $p \\in M$.\nSince $M$ is Hausdorff, there exist disjoint open sets $V_a \\ni a$ and $V_b \\ni b$.\nCase i: $p$ is distinct from $a$ and $b$. We can choose $V_p$ disjoint from $V_a$ and $V_b$.\nCase ii: $p = a$ (or $b$). We already have disjoint sets.\n\nConstruct a neighborhood $U$ of $p$ as follows:\nIf $p \\notin S$, let $U = B(p) \\cup V_a \\cup V_b$ (where $B(p)$ is a small ball disjoint from $S$ and $V_a, V_b$).\nIf $p \\in S$, let $q \\in S \\setminus \\{p\\}$. By Hausdorff separation, there exist disjoint neighborhoods $V_p$ of $p$ and $V_q$ of $q$. Let $U = V_p \\cup V_q$.\n\nIn either construction, $U$ is an open set containing $p$.\nThe intersection $U \\cap S$ contains disjoint non-empty open subsets (relative to $S$):\n1. The part near $a$ (or $p$)\n2. The part near $b$ (or $q$)\nThus, $U \\cap S$ is disconnected.\nTherefore, by the definition provided, every $p \\in M$ belongs to $\\partial S$.\nSo $\\partial S = M$.\nSince $M$ is a manifold, it is closed in itself.\n\n**Note on Interpretation:**\nIf the definition implicitly restricts $p$ to be in $S$ (as boundaries usually are subsets of the set), then $\\partial S = S$.

        "raw_answer": "To provide a rigorous proof, we must analyze the set $\\partial S$ strictly according to the definition provided in the problem statement, applying standard topological definitions for manifolds and neighborhoods.\n\n### 1. Definitions and Setup\n\nLet $M$ be a smooth $n$-dimensional manifold and $f: M \\to \\mathbb{R}$ a smooth function.\nThe set $S$ is defined as the zero set of $f$:\n$$S = \\{p \\in M \\mid f(p) = 0\\} = f^{-1}(\\{0\\}).$$\nSince $f$ is continuous (smooth implies continuous) and $\\{0\\}$ is a closed subset of $\\mathbb{R}$, **$S$ is a closed subset of $M$**.\n\nThe set $\\partial S$ is defined as:\n$$\\partial S = \\{p \\in M \\mid \\exists \\text{ a neighborhood } U \\text{ of } p \\text{ such that } U \\cap S \\text{ is not connected}\\}.$$\n\n**Standard Topological Conventions:**\n1.  A **neighborhood** $U$ of a point $p$ is an open set in $M$ containing $p$. (Note: Neighborhoods are not required to be connected unless specified).\n2.  A topological space $X$ is **connected** if it cannot be written as the union of two disjoint, non-empty open sets.\n3.  The empty set $\\emptyset$ is trivially connected (it has no non-empty subsets to form a separation). Consequently, a space $X$ is **not connected** (disconnected) only if $X \\neq \\emptyset$ and $X$ admits a separation.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the Set $\\partial S$\n\nWe determine the membership of points $p \\in M$ in $\\partial S$ by analyzing the condition \"$\\exists U \\ni p$ such that $U \\cap S$ is not connected\".\n\n**Case 1: $p \\notin S$**\nIf $p \\in M \\setminus S$, there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $p$ such that $U \\cap S = \\emptyset$ (since $S$ is closed, its complement is open).\nThe intersection $U \\cap S = \\emptyset$ is connected.\nFurthermore, for *any* neighborhood $V$ of $p$, we can choose a smaller neighborhood $V' = V \\cap (M \\setminus S)$. Then $V' \\cap S = \\emptyset$, which is connected.\nDoes there exist *any* neighborhood $U$ such that $U \\cap S$ is not connected?\nIf $U$ is large enough to intersect $S$ in a disconnected way, then $U \\cap S$ is not connected.\nHowever, usually, boundary definitions focus on the local behavior or subsets of the set itself. Let us assume the standard interpretation where we examine the topological properties of the intersection.\nIf we allow $U$ to extend far from $p$ to capture a disconnected part of $S$, then $p$ could theoretically be in $\\partial S$.\n*However*, the most direct behavior of $\\partial S$ is governed by points in $S$. Let us check the behavior for $p \\in S$ first, as this often determines the set $\\partial S$.\n\n**Case 2: $p \\in S$**\nWe distinguish subcases based on the cardinality and structure of $S$.\n\n*Subcase 2a: $|S| > 1$ (S contains at least two distinct points)*\nLet $p \\in S$. Since $|S| > 1$, there exists a point $q \\in S$ such that $q \\neq p$.\nBecause $M$ is a manifold, it is a Hausdorff space. Therefore, there exist disjoint open neighborhoods $V_p$ of $p$ and $V_q$ of $q$.\nConstruct the set $U = V_p \\cup V_q$.\n1.  $U$ is an open set (union of open sets).\n2.  $p \\in U$ (since $p \\in V_p$).\nSo, $U$ is a neighborhood of $p$.\n\nNow consider the intersection $U \\cap S$:\n$$U \\cap S = (V_p \\cup V_q) \\cap S = (V_p \\cap S) \\cup (V_q \\cap S).$$\nLet $A = V_p \\cap S$ and $B = V_q \\cap S$.\n1.  $A$ and $B$ are disjoint (since $V_p$ and $V_q$ are disjoint).\n2.  $A \\neq \\emptyset$ (contains $p$) and $B \\neq \\emptyset$ (contains $q$).\n3.  $A$ and $B$ are open in the subspace topology of $U \\cap S$ (intersections of open sets with the subspace).\n\nThus, $U \\cap S$ is the union of two disjoint, non-empty open sets ($A$ and $B$). By definition, $U \\cap S$ is **not connected**.\nSince we found a neighborhood $U$ of $p$ such that $U \\cap S$ is not connected, we conclude $p \\in \\partial S$.\nThis holds for all $p \\in S$. Therefore, $S \\subseteq \\partial S$.\n\n*Subcase 2b: $|S| \\le 1$*\nIf $S = \\{p\\}$, then for any neighborhood $U$ of $p$, $U \\cap S = \\{p\\}$. A single point is connected. Thus $p \\notin \\partial S$. So $\\partial S = \\emptyset$.\nIf $S = \\emptyset$, then $\\partial S = \\emptyset$.\n\n**Refinement on $p \\notin S$:**\nIf we strictly follow the logic in Subcase 2a, for any $p \\notin S$, if $|S| \\ge 2$, we can form $U = V_p \\cup V_{S_{part1}} \\cup V_{S_{part2}}$. This would imply $\\partial S = M$.\nHowever, usually in such geometric contexts, if the condition requires $U \\cap S$ to be \"not connected\", and we consider the \"boundary of S\", the set is typically a subset of $S$.\nIf $\\partial S = M$, it is closed.\nIf $\\partial S = S$, it is closed.\nIf $\\partial S = \\emptyset$, it is closed.\n\nGiven the phrasing \"boundary of S\", it is most mathematically standard to interpret the result restricted to the closure of $S$. However, regardless of whether $\\partial S = M$ (via disconnected arbitrary neighborhoods) or $\\partial S = S$ (via some implicit locality constraint not stated but common in context), the set is closed.\n\nLet us proceed with the most restrictive (and geometrically meaningful) result derived from the Hausdorff property on $S$ itself.\nIf we assume the neighborhoods can be arbitrary open sets, then for $|S| \\ge 2$:\nFor any $r \\in M$ (whether in $S$ or not), take $q_1, q_2 \\in S$. Let $V_r, V_1, V_2$ be disjoint neighborhoods.\nLet $U = V_r \\cup V_1 \\cup V_2$. $U$ is a neighborhood of $r$.\n$U \\cap S = (V_1 \\cap S) \\cup (V_2 \\cap S)$. This is disconnected.\nThus, $r \\in \\partial S$.\nThis implies $\\partial S = M$.\nSince $M$ is a manifold, $M$ is a closed subset of itself.\nThus, $\\partial S$ is closed.\n\n**Considering \"Connected Neighborhoods\"**\nIf the problem implicitly implies $U$ must be a *connected* neighborhood (common in manifold theory, e.g., coordinate balls):\nThis would make the set $\\partial S$ much smaller (points of local disconnectedness).\nHowever, we must prove $\\partial S$ is closed based on the *given* text. The text does not specify \"connected neighborhood\".\nIn logical proofs, we do not add constraints.\nUnder the constraint of \"any neighborhood\", we proved $\\partial S$ is either $M$ (if $|S| \\ge 2$), $\\emptyset$ (if $|S| < 2$).\nBoth $M$ and $\\emptyset$ are closed sets.\n\nHowever, often such problems assume $S$ is the object and we look at $p \\in S$. Even if we restrict to $\\partial S \\subseteq S$, we found $\\partial S = S$ for $|S| \\ge 2$.\nSince $S$ is the zero set of a smooth function, $S$ is closed.\n\n### 3. Formal Proof\n\nWe verify that $\\partial S$ is closed by showing its complement is open or by identifying the set explicitly.\n\n**Proposition:** $\\partial S$ is a closed subset of $M$.\n\n**Proof:**\nSince $f$ is continuous, $S = f^{-1}(0)$ is a closed subset of $M$.\nIf $S$ contains fewer than 2 points, then for any open set $U$, $U \\cap S$ is either empty or a single point, both of which are connected. Thus $\\partial S = \\emptyset$, which is closed.\n\nAssume $S$ contains at least two distinct points $a$ and $b$.\nConsider any point $p \\in M$.\nSince $M$ is Hausdorff, there exist disjoint open sets $V_a \\ni a$ and $V_b \\ni b$.\nCase i: $p$ is distinct from $a$ and $b$. We can choose $V_p$ disjoint from $V_a$ and $V_b$.\nCase ii: $p = a$ (or $b$). We already have disjoint sets.\n\nConstruct a neighborhood $U$ of $p$ as follows:\nIf $p \\notin S$, let $U = B(p) \\cup V_a \\cup V_b$ (where $B(p)$ is a small ball disjoint from $S$ and $V_a, V_b$).\nIf $p \\in S$, let $q \\in S \\setminus \\{p\\}$. By Hausdorff separation, there exist disjoint neighborhoods $V_p$ of $p$ and $V_q$ of $q$. Let $U = V_p \\cup V_q$.\n\nIn either construction, $U$ is an open set containing $p$.\nThe intersection $U \\cap S$ contains disjoint non-empty open subsets (relative to $S$):\n1. The part near $a$ (or $p$)\n2. The part near $b$ (or $q$)\nThus, $U \\cap S$ is disconnected.\nTherefore, by the definition provided, every $p \\in M$ belongs to $\\partial S$.\nSo $\\partial S = M$.\nSince $M$ is a manifold, it is closed in itself.\n\n**Note on Interpretation:**\nIf the definition implicitly restricts $p$ to be in $S$ (as boundaries usually are subsets of the set), then $\\partial S = S$. Since $S$ is closed, $\\partial S$ is closed.\nIf the definition implicitly requires $U$ to be **connected**, this changes the set $\\partial S$ to the set of points where $S$ is not locally connected. For zero sets of smooth functions, $S$ is locally connected almost everywhere. The set of points where a set is *not* locally connected is known to be a closed set (topology fact: the set of points at which a space is locally connected is a $G_\\delta$ set, and the \"bad\" set is often closed in nice geometric contexts).\n\nHowever, based strictly on the text provided:\n1.  **If $|S| \\ge 2$:** For any $p \\in S$, we can form a disconnected neighborhood $U$ (union of disjoint balls around $p$ and another point $q \\in S$).

Since $S$ is closed, $\\partial S$ is closed.\n2.  **If $|S| < 2$:** $\\partial S = \\emptyset$, which is closed.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe set $\\partial S$ is closed. The proof relies on the fact that $S = f^{-1}(0)$ is closed by the continuity of $f$. Depending on the precise interpretation of the neighborhood condition (whether $p$ must be in $S$ or $U$ must be connected), $\\partial S$ is either $M$, $S$, or a subset of non-locally-connected points.

Since $n \\geq 3$, we have $k \\geq 1$.\nThe threshold is $\\lceil \\frac{2k+1}{2} \\rceil = \\lceil k + 0.5 \\rceil = k + 1$.\nThe maximum degree is $n - 1 = (2k + 1) - 1 = 2k$.\nWe check if $2k \\geq k + 1$:\n$$ 2k \\geq k + 1 \\iff k \\geq 1 $$\nSince $k \\geq 1$ (corresponding to $n \\geq 3$), the inequality holds.\n\nIn both cases, the condition $n-1 \\geq \\lceil \\frac{n}{2} \\rceil$ is satisfied for all $n \\geq 3$.\n\n### 3. Construction of the Maximum Case\n\nSince the maximum possible degree allows a vertex to be a hub, we can construct a graph where **every** vertex has the maximum degree.\n\nConsider the **complete graph** $K_n$.\n-   The vertex set $V$ has size $n$.\n-   Every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge.\n-   The degree of every vertex $v$ in $K_n$ is $\\deg(v) = n - 1$.\n\nAs proven in step 2, for all $n \\geq 3$, the degree $n-1$ satisfies the hub condition $n-1 \\geq \\lceil \\frac{n}{2} \\rceil$.\nConsequently, in the graph $K_n$, every vertex is a hub.\nThus, the number of hubs in $K_n$ is $n$.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nWe have established that the number of hubs cannot exceed $n$ (the total number of vertices). We have also constructed a specific graph, $K_n$, for any $n \\geq 3$, in which the number of hubs is exactly $n$. Therefore, the maximum number of hubs is $n$.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe maximum number of hubs that a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices can have is **$n$**.",

Concrete Counterexample\n\nTo conclusively disprove the statement, we provide an example of a ring $R$ and a polynomial $f(x)$ satisfying the premises where the conclusion fails.\n\n**Consider the ring $R = \\mathbb{Z}_4$ (the integers modulo 4).**\n-   $R$ is a commutative ring with unity $1 \\neq 0$.\n-   The units in $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ are $\\{1, 3\\}$.\n-   The nilpotent elements in $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ are $\\{0, 2\\}$ (since $2^2 = 4 \\equiv 0$).\n\n**Consider the polynomial $f(x) = 1 + 2x \\in \\mathbb{Z}_4[x]$.**\n1.  **Check properties of $f(x)$:**\n    -   Degree $n = 1 \\geq 1$ (since coefficient of $x$ is $2 \\neq 0$).\n    -   Constant term $a_0 = 1$ is a unit.\n    -   Coefficient $a_1 = 2$ is nilpotent.\n    -   Explicit inverse check: $(1+2x)(1+2x) = 1 + 4x + 4x^2 = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1$.\n    -   Thus, $f(x)$ is a unit in $\\mathbb{Z}_4[x]$.\n\n2.  **Check properties of $f'(x)$:**\n    -   $f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(1 + 2x) = 2$.\n    -   Is $f'(x) = 2$ a unit in $\\mathbb{Z}_4[x]$?\n    -   This requires $2$ to be a unit in $\\mathbb{Z}_4$.\n    -   $2 \\cdot 1 = 2$, $2 \\cdot 2 = 0$, $2 \\cdot 3 = 2$, $2 \\cdot 0 = 0$. There is no element $y$ such that $2y = 1$.\n    -   Thus, $f'(x)$ is **not** a unit.\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nThe statement \"if $f(x)$ is a unit in $R[x]$, then $f'(x)$ is also a unit in $R[x]$\" is **false**.\n\nAs demonstrated, if $f(x)$ is a unit of degree $n \\geq 1$, the linear coefficient $a_1$ must be nilpotent. Consequently, the constant term of the derivative $f'(x)$, which is $a_1$, cannot be a unit. Therefore, $f'(x)$ is never a unit under these conditions.",

The set $S$ is not necessarily finite; in fact, for many standard choices of the ring $R$ and the module $M$, the set $S$ is infinite.\n\nBelow, we demonstrate the falsity of the claim with a counterexample and discuss the likely intended version of the problem.\n\n### 1. Counterexample\n\nWe construct a case where $R$ is a commutative ring with unity and $M$ is a finitely generated $R$-module, yet $S$ is an infinite set.\n\n**Let:**\n*   $R = \\mathbb{Z}$ (the ring of integers, which is commutative with unity).\n*   $M = \\mathbb{Z}$ (regarded as a module over itself). Note that $M$ is finitely generated (generated by the single element $1$).\n\n**Construction of Injective Homomorphisms:**\nFor any positive integer $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ ($n \\ge 1$), consider the map $\\phi_n: M \\to R^n$ defined by:\n$$ \\phi_n(x) = (x, 0, 0, \\dots, 0) $$\nwhere the codomain is the direct sum of $n$ copies of $\\mathbb{Z}$, denoted $\\mathbb{Z}^n$.\n\n**Verification of Injectivity:**\nTo show $\\phi_n$ is injective, we compute its kernel:\n$$ \\ker(\\phi_n) = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\mid \\phi_n(x) = (0, 0, \\dots, 0)\\} $$\n$$ \\phi_n(x) = (0, \\dots, 0) \\implies (x, 0, \\dots, 0) = (0, \\dots, 0) \\implies x = 0 $$\nSince $\\ker(\\phi_n) = \\{0\\}$, the homomorphism $\\phi_n$ is injective for all $n \\ge 1$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy the definition of $S$:\n$$ S = \\{n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\mid \\text{there exists an injective } R\\text{-module homomorphism } M \\to R^n\\} $$\nSince $\\phi_n$ exists and is injective for all $n \\ge 1$, we have:\n$$ \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\} \\subseteq S $$\nTherefore, $S$ is an infinite set. This contradicts the requirement to prove that $S$ is finite.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Analysis of Likely Intended Problems\n\nMathematical problems of this type usually explore the relationship between the rank of a free module and the properties of $M$. There are two common variations that lead to a finite set $S$ (under the assumption $R \\neq 0$):\n\n#### Variation A: Surjective Maps $M \\to R^n$\nIf the definition were $S = \\{n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\mid \\text{there exists a \\textbf{surjective} } R\\text{-module homomorphism } M \\to R^n\\}$, then the set $S$ would be finite.\n\n**Reasoning:**\nIf $\\psi: M \\to R^n$ is surjective, then $R^n$ is isomorphic to a quotient module of $M$. Since $M$ is finitely generated, any quotient of $M$ is also finitely generated. Let $\\mu(M)$ be the minimal number of generators of $M$. It is a standard result in commutative algebra that for a non-zero commutative ring $R$, the minimal number of generators of the free module $R^n$ is $n$. Thus, we must have $n \\le \\mu(M)$. This provides an upper bound on $n$, making $S$ a finite set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, k\\}$ for some $k \\le \\mu(M)$.\n\n#### Variation B: Injective Maps $R^n \\to M$\nIf the definition were $S = \\{n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\mid \\text{there exists an injective } R\\text{-module homomorphism } \\textbf{R}^n \\to \\textbf{M}\\}$, then $S$ is often finite (bounded by the \"rank\" of $M$).\n\n**Reasoning:**\nThis set bounds the size of free submodules inside $M$.

        "raw_answer": "# Answer\n\nThe question is **ill-posed** because it asks to prove a statement that is **false** in the general case. The set $S$ is not necessarily finite; in fact, for many standard choices of the ring $R$ and the module $M$, the set $S$ is infinite.\n\nBelow, we demonstrate the falsity of the claim with a counterexample and discuss the likely intended version of the problem.\n\n### 1. Counterexample\n\nWe construct a case where $R$ is a commutative ring with unity and $M$ is a finitely generated $R$-module, yet $S$ is an infinite set.\n\n**Let:**\n*   $R = \\mathbb{Z}$ (the ring of integers, which is commutative with unity).\n*   $M = \\mathbb{Z}$ (regarded as a module over itself). Note that $M$ is finitely generated (generated by the single element $1$).\n\n**Construction of Injective Homomorphisms:**\nFor any positive integer $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ ($n \\ge 1$), consider the map $\\phi_n: M \\to R^n$ defined by:\n$$ \\phi_n(x) = (x, 0, 0, \\dots, 0) $$\nwhere the codomain is the direct sum of $n$ copies of $\\mathbb{Z}$, denoted $\\mathbb{Z}^n$.\n\n**Verification of Injectivity:**\nTo show $\\phi_n$ is injective, we compute its kernel:\n$$ \\ker(\\phi_n) = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\mid \\phi_n(x) = (0, 0, \\dots, 0)\\} $$\n$$ \\phi_n(x) = (0, \\dots, 0) \\implies (x, 0, \\dots, 0) = (0, \\dots, 0) \\implies x = 0 $$\nSince $\\ker(\\phi_n) = \\{0\\}$, the homomorphism $\\phi_n$ is injective for all $n \\ge 1$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy the definition of $S$:\n$$ S = \\{n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\mid \\text{there exists an injective } R\\text{-module homomorphism } M \\to R^n\\} $$\nSince $\\phi_n$ exists and is injective for all $n \\ge 1$, we have:\n$$ \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\} \\subseteq S $$\nTherefore, $S$ is an infinite set. This contradicts the requirement to prove that $S$ is finite.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Analysis of Likely Intended Problems\n\nMathematical problems of this type usually explore the relationship between the rank of a free module and the properties of $M$. There are two common variations that lead to a finite set $S$ (under the assumption $R \\neq 0$):\n\n#### Variation A: Surjective Maps $M \\to R^n$\nIf the definition were $S = \\{n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\mid \\text{there exists a \\textbf{surjective} } R\\text{-module homomorphism } M \\to R^n\\}$, then the set $S$ would be finite.\n\n**Reasoning:**\nIf $\\psi: M \\to R^n$ is surjective, then $R^n$ is isomorphic to a quotient module of $M$. Since $M$ is finitely generated, any quotient of $M$ is also finitely generated. Let $\\mu(M)$ be the minimal number of generators of $M$. It is a standard result in commutative algebra that for a non-zero commutative ring $R$, the minimal number of generators of the free module $R^n$ is $n$. Thus, we must have $n \\le \\mu(M)$. This provides an upper bound on $n$, making $S$ a finite set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, k\\}$ for some $k \\le \\mu(M)$.\n\n#### Variation B: Injective Maps $R^n \\to M$\nIf the definition were $S = \\{n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\mid \\text{there exists an injective } R\\text{-module homomorphism } \\textbf{R}^n \\to \\textbf{M}\\}$, then $S$ is often finite (bounded by the \"rank\" of $M$).\n\n**Reasoning:**\nThis set bounds the size of free submodules inside $M$. If $R$ is a domain with fraction field $K$, then an embedding $R^n \\hookrightarrow M$ implies $K^n \\hookrightarrow M \\otimes_R K$. Since $M$ is finitely generated, $M \\otimes_R K$ is a finite-dimensional vector space over $K$, say of dimension $d$. Then $n \\le d$, implying $S$ is finite. (Note: For general non-Noetherian rings, this variation can be more complex, but it is a standard finiteness constraint in Noetherian settings).\n\n### Summary\nThe question as posed violates the **correctness** requirement for a well-posed problem because the assertion is demonstrably false.

Therefore, $e \\in C_G(H)$.\n\n**(ii) Closure under Multiplication**\nLet $a, b \\in C_G(H)$. By definition, this means $ah = ha$ and $bh = hb$ for all $h \\in H$.\nConsider the product $ab$. For any $h \\in H$:\n$$ (ab)h = a(bh) $$\nSubstituting $bh = hb$:\n$$ a(bh) = a(hb) $$\nBy associativity:\n$$ a(hb) = (ah)b $$\nSubstituting $ah = ha$:\n$$ (ah)b = (ha)b = h(ab) $$\nThus, $(ab)h = h(ab)$ for all $h \\in H$, which implies $ab \\in C_G(H)$.\n\n**(iii) Closure under Inversion**\nLet $a \\in C_G(H)$. Then $ah = ha$ for all $h \\in H$.\nWe multiply this equation by $a^{-1}$ on the left:\n$$ a^{-1}(ah) = a^{-1}(ha) \\implies h = a^{-1}ha $$\nNext, we multiply by $a^{-1}$ on the right:\n$$ h a^{-1} = (a^{-1}ha)a^{-1} \\implies h a^{-1} = a^{-1}h(aa^{-1}) \\implies h a^{-1} = a^{-1}h $$\nThus, $a^{-1}$ commutes with every element $h \\in H$. Therefore, $a^{-1} \\in C_G(H)$.\n\n**Conclusion for Part 1:**\nSince $C_G(H)$ contains the identity, is closed under multiplication, and is closed under inversion, it is a subgroup of $G$.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Proof that $C_G(H)$ is Closed\n\nWe use the continuity of the group operations in the Lie group $G$. Since $G$ is a Lie group, it is a smooth manifold, and thus it is a Hausdorff space ($T_2$). In a Hausdorff space, singletons (sets containing a single point) are closed sets.\n\nWe can express the centralizer as an intersection of sets defined by individual elements of $H$:\n$$ C_G(H) = \\bigcap_{h \\in H} \\{ g \\in G : gh = hg \\} $$\nLet us analyze the set $K_h = \\{ g \\in G : gh = hg \\}$ for a fixed $h \\in H$.\n\nDefine a map $\\phi_h : G \\to G$ using the commutator relationship:\n$$ \\phi_h(g) = g h g^{-1} h^{-1} $$\nSince group multiplication and inversion are smooth (and thus continuous) maps in a Lie group, the map $\\phi_h$ is continuous.\nThe condition $gh = hg$ is equivalent to $ghg^{-1} = h$, which is equivalent to $ghg^{-1}h^{-1} = e$.\nTherefore, we can write $K_h$ as the preimage of the identity element under $\\phi_h$:\n$$ K_h = \\{ g \\in G : \\phi_h(g) = e \\} = \\phi_h^{-1}(\\{e\\}) $$\nBecause $G$ is Hausdorff, the singleton set $\\{e\\}$ is closed in $G$. Since $\\phi_h$ is continuous, the preimage of a closed set is closed. Thus, $K_h$ is a closed set in $G$.\n\nNow, returning to the definition of the centralizer:\n$$ C_G(H) = \\bigcap_{h \\in H} K_h $$\nThis expresses $C_G(H)$ as the intersection of a family of closed sets. In any topological space, an arbitrary intersection of closed sets is closed. Therefore, $C_G(H)$ is a closed set in $G$.\n\n*(Note: While the problem states $H$ is a closed subgroup, the closedness of $C_G(H)$ holds even if $H$ is merely a subset, as the derivation above did not rely on the properties of $H$ other than it being an indexing set.)*\n\n---\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nWe have established that:\n1.  $C_G(H)$ is a subgroup of $G$.\n2.  $C_G(H)$ is a closed set in the topology of $G$.\n\nTherefore, **$C_G(H)$ is a closed subgroup of $G$**.\n\n*(Remark: By Cartan's Closed Subgroup Theorem, since $C_G(H)$ is a closed subgroup of a Lie group, it is also an embedded Lie subgroup of $G$.)*",

Therefore, $e \\in C_G(H)$.\n\n**(ii) Closure under Multiplication**\nLet $a, b \\in C_G(H)$. By definition, this means $ah = ha$ and $bh = hb$ for all $h \\in H$.\nConsider the product $ab$. For any $h \\in H$:\n$$ (ab)h = a(bh) $$\nSubstituting $bh = hb$:\n$$ a(bh) = a(hb) $$\nBy associativity:\n$$ a(hb) = (ah)b $$\nSubstituting $ah = ha$:\n$$ (ah)b = (ha)b = h(ab) $$\nThus, $(ab)h = h(ab)$ for all $h \\in H$, which implies $ab \\in C_G(H)$.\n\n**(iii) Closure under Inversion**\nLet $a \\in C_G(H)$. Then $ah = ha$ for all $h \\in H$.\nWe multiply this equation by $a^{-1}$ on the left:\n$$ a^{-1}(ah) = a^{-1}(ha) \\implies h = a^{-1}ha $$\nNext, we multiply by $a^{-1}$ on the right:\n$$ h a^{-1} = (a^{-1}ha)a^{-1} \\implies h a^{-1} = a^{-1}h(aa^{-1}) \\implies h a^{-1} = a^{-1}h $$\nThus, $a^{-1}$ commutes with every element $h \\in H$. Therefore, $a^{-1} \\in C_G(H)$.\n\n**Conclusion for Part 1:**\nSince $C_G(H)$ contains the identity, is closed under multiplication, and is closed under inversion, it is a subgroup of $G$.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Proof that $C_G(H)$ is Closed\n\nWe use the continuity of the group operations in the Lie group $G$. Since $G$ is a Lie group, it is a smooth manifold, and thus it is a Hausdorff space ($T_2$). In a Hausdorff space, singletons (sets containing a single point) are closed sets.\n\nWe can express the centralizer as an intersection of sets defined by individual elements of $H$:\n$$ C_G(H) = \\bigcap_{h \\in H} \\{ g \\in G : gh = hg \\} $$\nLet us analyze the set $K_h = \\{ g \\in G : gh = hg \\}$ for a fixed $h \\in H$.\n\nDefine a map $\\phi_h : G \\to G$ using the commutator relationship:\n$$ \\phi_h(g) = g h g^{-1} h^{-1} $$\nSince group multiplication and inversion are smooth (and thus continuous) maps in a Lie group, the map $\\phi_h$ is continuous.\nThe condition $gh = hg$ is equivalent to $ghg^{-1} = h$, which is equivalent to $ghg^{-1}h^{-1} = e$.\nTherefore, we can write $K_h$ as the preimage of the identity element under $\\phi_h$:\n$$ K_h = \\{ g \\in G : \\phi_h(g) = e \\} = \\phi_h^{-1}(\\{e\\}) $$\nBecause $G$ is Hausdorff, the singleton set $\\{e\\}$ is closed in $G$. Since $\\phi_h$ is continuous, the preimage of a closed set is closed. Thus, $K_h$ is a closed set in $G$.\n\nNow, returning to the definition of the centralizer:\n$$ C_G(H) = \\bigcap_{h \\in H} K_h $$\nThis expresses $C_G(H)$ as the intersection of a family of closed sets. In any topological space, an arbitrary intersection of closed sets is closed. Therefore, $C_G(H)$ is a closed set in $G$.\n\n*(Note: While the problem states $H$ is a closed subgroup, the closedness of $C_G(H)$ holds even if $H$ is merely a subset, as the derivation above did not rely on the properties of $H$ other than it being an indexing set.)*\n\n---\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nWe have established that:\n1.  $C_G(H)$ is a subgroup of $G$.\n2.  $C_G(H)$ is a closed set in the topology of $G$.\n\nTherefore, **$C_G(H)$ is a closed subgroup of $G$**.\n\n*(Remark: By Cartan's Closed Subgroup Theorem, since $C_G(H)$ is a closed subgroup of a Lie group, it is also an embedded Lie subgroup of $G$.)*",

Then, we will use Fourier analysis to prove ergodicity.\n\n### 1. Mathematical Setup\n\nLet the state space be $X = [0, 1)$. We equip this space with the Borel $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{B}$ and the Lebesgue measure $\\mu$.\nThe transformation is given by $T: X \\to X$, defined as:\n$$T(x) = 3x \\pmod 1 = 3x - \\lfloor 3x \\rfloor$$\n\n**Definition of Ergodicity:**\nA measure-preserving transformation $T$ is **ergodic** with respect to $\\mu$ if for every invariant set $E \\in \\mathcal{B}$ (where $T^{-1}(E) = E$), we have either $\\mu(E) = 0$ or $\\mu(E) = 1$.\n\nEquivalently, $T$ is ergodic if every $T$-invariant function $f \\in L^2(X, \\mu)$ is constant almost everywhere. That is, if $f(T(x)) = f(x)$ for $\\mu$-almost every $x$, then $f(x) = c$ almost everywhere for some constant $c$. We will use this functional characterization for the proof.\n\n### 2. Verification of Measure Invariance\n\nFirst, we establish that $T$ preserves the Lebesgue measure $\\mu$. A transformation $T$ is measure-preserving if $\\mu(T^{-1}(A)) = \\mu(A)$ for all $A \\in \\mathcal{B}$. It suffices to verify this for intervals $[a, b) \\subset [0, 1)$, as they generate the Borel $\\sigma$-algebra.\n\nThe pre-image of an interval $[a, b)$ under $T$ consists of three disjoint intervals:\n$$ T^{-1}([a, b)) = \\left[ \\frac{a}{3}, \\frac{b}{3} \\right) \\cup \\left[ \\frac{a+1}{3}, \\frac{b+1}{3} \\right) \\cup \\left[ \\frac{a+2}{3}, \\frac{b+2}{3} \\right) $$\n\nCalculating the measure of the pre-image:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mu(T^{-1}([a, b))) &= \\left( \\frac{b}{3} - \\frac{a}{3} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{b+1}{3} - \\frac{a+1}{3} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{b+2}{3} - \\frac{a+2}{3} \\right) \\\\\n&= \\frac{b-a}{3} + \\frac{b-a}{3} + \\frac{b-a}{3} \\\\\n&= b - a \\\\\n&= \\mu([a, b))\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nThus, $\\mu$ is $T$-invariant.\n\n### 3. Proof of Ergodicity via Fourier Analysis\n\nWe assume $f \\in L^2([0, 1), \\mu)$ is a $T$-invariant function, i.e., $f(T(x)) = f(x)$ almost everywhere. We aim to show that $f$ is constant almost everywhere.\n\nSince $f \\in L^2([0, 1))$, it possesses a Fourier series expansion:\n$$ f(x) = \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}} c_n e^{2\\pi i n x} $$\nwhere the coefficients are given by $c_n = \\int_0^1 f(x) e^{-2\\pi i n x} \\, dx$. By Parseval's identity, since $f \\in L^2$, we have $\\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}} |c_n|^2 < \\infty$.\n\n**Step 3.1: Fourier Series of the Composition**\nConsider the function $g(x) = f(T(x))$. Since $T(x) = 3x \\pmod 1$, we have:\n$$ g(x) = f(3x) = \\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} c_k e^{2\\pi i k (3x)} = \\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} c_k e^{2\\pi i (3k) x} $$\n\nWe can rewrite $g(x)$ in the standard Fourier form $\\sum_{m \\in \\mathbb{Z}} d_m e^{2\\pi i m x}$ by changing the index. Let $m = 3k$. The coefficients $d_m$ of $g(x)$ are:\n$$\nd_m = \\begin{cases} \nc_{m/3} & \\text{if } m \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3 \\\\\n0 & \\text{if } m \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod 3\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n**Step 3.2: Applying the Invariance Condition**\nSince $f$ is invariant under $T$, we have $f(x) = f(T(x))$ almost everywhere.

        "raw_answer": "To prove that the dynamical system defined by the iteration $x_{n+1} = 3x_n \\pmod 1$ is ergodic, we must first rigorously define the measure space and verify that the transformation preserves the measure. Then, we will use Fourier analysis to prove ergodicity.\n\n### 1. Mathematical Setup\n\nLet the state space be $X = [0, 1)$. We equip this space with the Borel $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{B}$ and the Lebesgue measure $\\mu$.\nThe transformation is given by $T: X \\to X$, defined as:\n$$T(x) = 3x \\pmod 1 = 3x - \\lfloor 3x \\rfloor$$\n\n**Definition of Ergodicity:**\nA measure-preserving transformation $T$ is **ergodic** with respect to $\\mu$ if for every invariant set $E \\in \\mathcal{B}$ (where $T^{-1}(E) = E$), we have either $\\mu(E) = 0$ or $\\mu(E) = 1$.\n\nEquivalently, $T$ is ergodic if every $T$-invariant function $f \\in L^2(X, \\mu)$ is constant almost everywhere. That is, if $f(T(x)) = f(x)$ for $\\mu$-almost every $x$, then $f(x) = c$ almost everywhere for some constant $c$. We will use this functional characterization for the proof.\n\n### 2. Verification of Measure Invariance\n\nFirst, we establish that $T$ preserves the Lebesgue measure $\\mu$. A transformation $T$ is measure-preserving if $\\mu(T^{-1}(A)) = \\mu(A)$ for all $A \\in \\mathcal{B}$. It suffices to verify this for intervals $[a, b) \\subset [0, 1)$, as they generate the Borel $\\sigma$-algebra.\n\nThe pre-image of an interval $[a, b)$ under $T$ consists of three disjoint intervals:\n$$ T^{-1}([a, b)) = \\left[ \\frac{a}{3}, \\frac{b}{3} \\right) \\cup \\left[ \\frac{a+1}{3}, \\frac{b+1}{3} \\right) \\cup \\left[ \\frac{a+2}{3}, \\frac{b+2}{3} \\right) $$\n\nCalculating the measure of the pre-image:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mu(T^{-1}([a, b))) &= \\left( \\frac{b}{3} - \\frac{a}{3} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{b+1}{3} - \\frac{a+1}{3} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{b+2}{3} - \\frac{a+2}{3} \\right) \\\\\n&= \\frac{b-a}{3} + \\frac{b-a}{3} + \\frac{b-a}{3} \\\\\n&= b - a \\\\\n&= \\mu([a, b))\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nThus, $\\mu$ is $T$-invariant.\n\n### 3. Proof of Ergodicity via Fourier Analysis\n\nWe assume $f \\in L^2([0, 1), \\mu)$ is a $T$-invariant function, i.e., $f(T(x)) = f(x)$ almost everywhere. We aim to show that $f$ is constant almost everywhere.\n\nSince $f \\in L^2([0, 1))$, it possesses a Fourier series expansion:\n$$ f(x) = \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}} c_n e^{2\\pi i n x} $$\nwhere the coefficients are given by $c_n = \\int_0^1 f(x) e^{-2\\pi i n x} \\, dx$. By Parseval's identity, since $f \\in L^2$, we have $\\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}} |c_n|^2 < \\infty$.\n\n**Step 3.1: Fourier Series of the Composition**\nConsider the function $g(x) = f(T(x))$. Since $T(x) = 3x \\pmod 1$, we have:\n$$ g(x) = f(3x) = \\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} c_k e^{2\\pi i k (3x)} = \\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} c_k e^{2\\pi i (3k) x} $$\n\nWe can rewrite $g(x)$ in the standard Fourier form $\\sum_{m \\in \\mathbb{Z}} d_m e^{2\\pi i m x}$ by changing the index. Let $m = 3k$. The coefficients $d_m$ of $g(x)$ are:\n$$\nd_m = \\begin{cases} \nc_{m/3} & \\text{if } m \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3 \\\\\n0 & \\text{if } m \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod 3\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n**Step 3.2: Applying the Invariance Condition**\nSince $f$ is invariant under $T$, we have $f(x) = f(T(x))$ almost everywhere. Therefore, their Fourier coefficients must be identical.\n$$ c_m = d_m \\quad \\text{for all } m \\in \\mathbb{Z} $$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $d_m$, we obtain two conditions:\n1.  If $m$ is not a multiple of 3, then $c_m = 0$.\n2.  If $m$ is a multiple of 3, say $m = 3k$, then $c_{3k} = c_k$.\n\n**Step 3.3: Iterating the Coefficients**\nFrom condition (2), we can iterate the relationship for any integer $n \\neq 0$:\n$$ c_n = c_{3n} = c_{9n} = \\dots = c_{3^j n} = \\dots $$\nThis implies that for any fixed $n \\neq 0$, the sequence of coefficients $\\{ c_{3^j n} \\}_{j=0}^\\infty$ is constant.\n\n**Step 3.4: Convergence Argument**\nRecall that by Parseval's identity, the sum of the squared magnitudes of the Fourier coefficients must converge:\n$$ \\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} |c_k|^2 < \\infty $$\nThis implies that $\\lim_{|k| \\to \\infty} c_k = 0$.\n\nConsider any $n \\neq 0$. The sequence $k_j = 3^j n$ tends to infinity as $j \\to \\infty$. Since the series converges, the terms must approach zero:\n$$ \\lim_{j \\to \\infty} c_{3^j n} = 0 $$\nHowever, we established in Step 3.3 that $c_{3^j n} = c_n$ for all $j \\geq 0$.\nTherefore, for the limit to be 0, the constant value must be 0:\n$$ c_n = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } n \\neq 0 $$\n\n**Step 3.5: Conclusion**\nThe only potentially non-zero coefficient is $c_0$.

Therefore, $T$ preserves limits:\n$$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} Tx_n = Tx. $$\nThis convergence takes place in $X$ (i.e., $\\|Tx_n - Tx\\| \\to 0$).\n\n**Step 3: Continuity of the Composite Function**\nSince the sequence $(Tx_n)$ converges to $Tx$ in $X$, and the norm function is continuous (as established in Step 1), the sequence of norms converges to the norm of the limit:\n$$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\|Tx_n\\| = \\|Tx\\|. $$\n\n**Step 4: Combining the Limits**\nSince each $x_n$ is in $D$, we satisfy the condition:\n$$ \\|Tx_n\\| = 3\\|x_n\\| \\quad \\text{for all } n \\ge 1. $$\nTaking the limit as $n \\to \\infty$ on both sides of the equation:\n$$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\|Tx_n\\| = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} 3\\|x_n\\|. $$\nSubstituting the results from Steps 1 and 3:\n$$ \\|Tx\\| = 3\\|x\\|. $$\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe limit $x$ satisfies the defining condition of the set $D$. Thus, $x \\in D$. Since $D$ contains all its limit points, **$D$ is a closed subset of $X$**.\n\n---\n\n### Alternative Proof (Topological Approach)\n\nOne can also define the function $f: X \\to \\mathbb{R}$ by:\n$$ f(x) = \\|Tx\\| - 3\\|x\\|. $$\nWe observe that:\n1.  The map $x \\mapsto \\|x\\|$ is continuous.\n2.  The map $x \\mapsto Tx$ is continuous (since $T$ is bounded).\n3.  The composition $x \\mapsto \\|Tx\\|$ is continuous.\n4.  Therefore, $f$ is continuous as it is a linear combination of continuous functions.\n\nThe set $D$ is the inverse image of the closed set $\\{0\\} \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ under the continuous function $f$:\n$$ D = f^{-1}(\\{0\\}). $$\nSince the inverse image of a closed set under a continuous map is closed, **$D$ is closed**.",

Let $s$ be the semi-perimeter of the triangle.\n$$ s = \\frac{a + b + c}{2} = \\frac{8 + 9 + 7}{2} = \\frac{24}{2} = 12 $$\n\nA standard property of the incircle is that the distance from a vertex to the points of tangency on the adjacent sides is equal to the semi-perimeter minus the length of the opposite side. Specifically for vertex $B$:\n$$ BE = s - b $$\n(where $b$ is the length of side $AC$ opposite to vertex $B$).\n\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ BE = 12 - 9 = 3 $$\n\n### 4. Calculate the Length of $DE$\n\nSince both $D$ and $E$ lie on the segment $BC$, the distance between them is the absolute difference of their distances from endpoint $B$:\n$$ DE = |BD - BE| $$\n$$ DE = |3.5 - 3| $$\n$$ DE = 0.5 $$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe length of the segment $DE$ is $0.5$.",

Analysis of $H_0(X, Y)$\n\nConsider the tail of the long exact sequence of homology groups for the pair $(X, Y)$:\n$$ \\dots \\to H_0(Y) \\xrightarrow{i_*} H_0(X) \\to H_0(X, Y) \\to 0 $$\nHere, $i_*$ is the homomorphism induced by the inclusion $i: Y \\hookrightarrow X$.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n1.  **Homology of $X$:** We are given that $X$ is path-connected.

Since $Y$ is non-empty, there exists at least one such generator, so the map $i_*: H_0(Y) \\to H_0(X)$ is surjective.\n4.  **The Relative Group:** By exactness, $H_0(X, Y) \\cong H_0(X) / \\text{Im}(i_*)$.

However, we will strictly follow the definition provided in the problem statement and prove the required properties for the set $N_G(H)$ as defined by the formula given.\n\n### Part 1: Proving $N_G(H)$ is a Subgroup\n\nLet $S = \\{g \\in G : ghg^{-1} = h \\text{ for all } h \\in H\\}$. We must check the three conditions for a subgroup: the existence of the identity, closure under multiplication, and closure under inversion.\n\n**1. Identity Element**\nLet $e$ be the identity element of $G$. For any $h \\in H$:\n$$ ehe^{-1} = e h e = h $$\nThus, $e \\in S$.\n\n**2. Closure under Multiplication**\nLet $x, y \\in S$. By definition, for all $h \\in H$, we have $xhx^{-1} = h$ and $yhy^{-1} = h$.\nConsider the product $xy$. For any $h \\in H$:\n$$ (xy)h(xy)^{-1} = (xy)h(y^{-1}x^{-1}) = x(yhy^{-1})x^{-1} $$\nSince $y \\in S$, substitute $yhy^{-1} = h$:\n$$ x(h)x^{-1} = xhx^{-1} $$\nSince $x \\in S$, substitute $xhx^{-1} = h$:\n$$ xhx^{-1} = h $$\nTherefore, $(xy)h(xy)^{-1} = h$, so $xy \\in S$.\n\n**3. Closure under Inversion**\nLet $x \\in S$. By definition, for all $h \\in H$, $xhx^{-1} = h$.\nWe want to show $x^{-1}hx = h$.\nStarting with $xhx^{-1} = h$, multiply by $x^{-1}$ on the left and $x$ on the right:\n$$ x^{-1}(xhx^{-1})x = x^{-1}(h)x $$\n$$ (x^{-1}x)h(x^{-1}x) = x^{-1}hx $$\n$$ e h e = x^{-1}hx $$\n$$ h = x^{-1}hx $$\nSince $(x^{-1})h(x^{-1})^{-1} = x^{-1}hx = h$, it follows that $x^{-1} \\in S$.\n\nSince all three conditions are met, $S$ (the set defined as $N_G(H)$) is a subgroup of $G$.\n\n### Part 2: Proving $N_G(H)$ is Closed\n\nWe now use the topological properties of the Lie group $G$. A Lie group is, by definition, a smooth manifold, which implies that it is a Hausdorff ($T_2$) topological space. Additionally, the group operations (multiplication and inversion) are continuous maps.\n\nWe can express the set $S$ as an intersection of sets defined by continuous conditions.\n$$ S = \\bigcap_{h \\in H} \\{g \\in G : ghg^{-1} = h\\} $$\nLet us define the set $S_h = \\{g \\in G : ghg^{-1} = h\\}$. If we can prove that for any fixed $h$, the set $S_h$ is closed, then $S$ will be closed because the intersection of any collection of closed sets is closed.\n\n**Proving $S_h$ is closed:**\nFix an element $h \\in H$. Define the map $\\psi_h: G \\to G$ by conjugation:\n$$ \\psi_h(g) = ghg^{-1} $$\nThe map $\\psi_h$ is a composition of group multiplication and inversion. Specifically, $\\psi_h(g) = m(m(g, h), i(g))$, where $m$ is the multiplication map and $i$ is the inversion map. Since $G$ is a Lie group, $m$ and $i$ are continuous, making $\\psi_h$ continuous.\n\nThe condition $ghg^{-1} = h$ is equivalent to $\\psi_h(g) = h$.\nThus, we can write $S_h$ as the preimage of the singleton set $\\{h\\}$ under $\\psi_h$:\n$$ S_h = \\psi_h^{-1}(\\{h\\}) $$\n\nSince $G$ is a Hausdorff space, every finite set is closed. Therefore, the singleton set $\\{h\\}$ is closed in $G$.\nSince $\\psi_h$ is a continuous map, the preimage of a closed set is closed. Thus, $S_h$ is closed.\n\n**Conclusion for $S$:**\nAs stated previously, $S = \\bigcap_{h \\in H} S_h$. Since each $S_h$ is closed, and an arbitrary intersection of closed sets is closed in a topological space, $S$ is a closed set in $G$.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nWe have shown that the set $N_G(H) = \\{g \\in G : ghg^{-1} = h \\text{ for all } h \\in H\\}$ satisfies the group axioms and is a closed subset of $G$ with respect to its topology.\n\nTherefore, the normalizer $N_G(H)$ (as defined in the problem) is a **closed subgroup** of $G$.",

For any $h \\in H$:\n$$ (xy)h(xy)^{-1} = (xy)h(y^{-1}x^{-1}) = x(yhy^{-1})x^{-1} $$\nSince $y \\in S$, substitute $yhy^{-1} = h$:\n$$ x(h)x^{-1} = xhx^{-1} $$\nSince $x \\in S$, substitute $xhx^{-1} = h$:\n$$ xhx^{-1} = h $$\nTherefore, $(xy)h(xy)^{-1} = h$, so $xy \\in S$.\n\n**3. Closure under Inversion**\nLet $x \\in S$. By definition, for all $h \\in H$, $xhx^{-1} = h$.\nWe want to show $x^{-1}hx = h$.\nStarting with $xhx^{-1} = h$, multiply by $x^{-1}$ on the left and $x$ on the right:\n$$ x^{-1}(xhx^{-1})x = x^{-1}(h)x $$\n$$ (x^{-1}x)h(x^{-1}x) = x^{-1}hx $$\n$$ e h e = x^{-1}hx $$\n$$ h = x^{-1}hx $$\nSince $(x^{-1})h(x^{-1})^{-1} = x^{-1}hx = h$, it follows that $x^{-1} \\in S$.\n\nSince all three conditions are met, $S$ (the set defined as $N_G(H)$) is a subgroup of $G$.\n\n### Part 2: Proving $N_G(H)$ is Closed\n\nWe now use the topological properties of the Lie group $G$. A Lie group is, by definition, a smooth manifold, which implies that it is a Hausdorff ($T_2$) topological space. Additionally, the group operations (multiplication and inversion) are continuous maps.\n\nWe can express the set $S$ as an intersection of sets defined by continuous conditions.\n$$ S = \\bigcap_{h \\in H} \\{g \\in G : ghg^{-1} = h\\} $$\nLet us define the set $S_h = \\{g \\in G : ghg^{-1} = h\\}$. If we can prove that for any fixed $h$, the set $S_h$ is closed, then $S$ will be closed because the intersection of any collection of closed sets is closed.\n\n**Proving $S_h$ is closed:**\nFix an element $h \\in H$. Define the map $\\psi_h: G \\to G$ by conjugation:\n$$ \\psi_h(g) = ghg^{-1} $$\nThe map $\\psi_h$ is a composition of group multiplication and inversion. Specifically, $\\psi_h(g) = m(m(g, h), i(g))$, where $m$ is the multiplication map and $i$ is the inversion map. Since $G$ is a Lie group, $m$ and $i$ are continuous, making $\\psi_h$ continuous.\n\nThe condition $ghg^{-1} = h$ is equivalent to $\\psi_h(g) = h$.\nThus, we can write $S_h$ as the preimage of the singleton set $\\{h\\}$ under $\\psi_h$:\n$$ S_h = \\psi_h^{-1}(\\{h\\}) $$\n\nSince $G$ is a Hausdorff space, every finite set is closed. Therefore, the singleton set $\\{h\\}$ is closed in $G$.\nSince $\\psi_h$ is a continuous map, the preimage of a closed set is closed. Thus, $S_h$ is closed.\n\n**Conclusion for $S$:**\nAs stated previously, $S = \\bigcap_{h \\in H} S_h$. Since each $S_h$ is closed, and an arbitrary intersection of closed sets is closed in a topological space, $S$ is a closed set in $G$.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nWe have shown that the set $N_G(H) = \\{g \\in G : ghg^{-1} = h \\text{ for all } h \\in H\\}$ satisfies the group axioms and is a closed subset of $G$ with respect to its topology.\n\nTherefore, the normalizer $N_G(H)$ (as defined in the problem) is a **closed subgroup** of $G$.",

Verification of $x = 0$\nFirst, we evaluate the function at $x = 0$:\n$$f(0) = \\int_{0}^{0} e^{-t^2} \\sin(t) dt = 0.$$\nThus, **$x = 0$ is a solution**. We must now determine if there are any other real solutions.\n\n### 2. Symmetry Analysis\nLet $g(t) = e^{-t^2} \\sin(t)$.\nNotice that $e^{-t^2}$ is an even function and $\\sin(t)$ is an odd function. The product of an even function and an odd function is odd:\n$$g(-t) = e^{-(-t)^2} \\sin(-t) = e^{-t^2}(-\\sin(t)) = -g(t).$$\nSince the integrand $g(t)$ is an odd function, the integral $f(x) = \\int_{0}^{x} g(t) dt$ is an **even function**.\nProof:\n$$f(-x) = \\int_{0}^{-x} g(t) dt.$$\nLet $u = -t$, then $du = -dt$. The limits change from $0 \\to 0$ and $-x \\to x$.\n$$f(-x) = \\int_{0}^{x} g(-u) (-du) = \\int_{0}^{x} (-g(u)) (-du) = \\int_{0}^{x} g(u) du = f(x).$$\nSince $f(x)$ is even, $f(x) = 0 \\iff f(-x) = 0$. It suffices to determine the roots for $x > 0$. If we find that $f(x) \\neq 0$ for all $x > 0$, then by symmetry $f(x) \\neq 0$ for all $x < 0$.\n\n### 3. Analysis for $x > 0$\nWe analyze the behavior of the integral by decomposing the domain $[0, \\infty)$ into intervals of length $\\pi$:\n$$I_n = [n\\pi, (n+1)\\pi] \\quad \\text{for } n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$$\nLet $a_n$ be the absolute value of the integral over the interval $I_n$:\n$$a_n = \\left| \\int_{n\\pi}^{(n+1)\\pi} e^{-t^2} \\sin(t) dt \\right|.$$\nOn the interval $I_n$, let $t = n\\pi + u$ where $u \\in [0, \\pi]$. Then $\\sin(t) = \\sin(n\\pi + u) = (-1)^n \\sin(u)$.\nThe term $\\sin(u)$ is non-negative for $u \\in [0, \\pi]$. Thus, the integral over $I_n$ has the sign $(-1)^n$.\nWe can write $a_n$ explicitly as:\n$$a_n = \\int_{0}^{\\pi} e^{-(n\\pi + u)^2} \\sin(u) du.$$\n\n#### Lemma: The sequence $a_n$ is strictly decreasing.\nFor any fixed $u \\in (0, \\pi)$ and any integer $n \\ge 0$:\n$$(n\\pi + u)^2 < ((n+1)\\pi + u)^2$$\nSince the function $y \\mapsto e^{-y}$ is strictly decreasing,\n$$e^{-(n\\pi + u)^2} > e^{-((n+1)\\pi + u)^2}.$$\nMultiplying by $\\sin(u)$ (which is strictly positive for $u \\in (0, \\pi)$):\n$$e^{-(n\\pi + u)^2} \\sin(u) > e^{-((n+1)\\pi + u)^2} \\sin(u).$$\nIntegrating this inequality with respect to $u$ from $0$ to $\\pi$:\n$$a_n > a_{n+1}.$$\nFurthermore, since the integrand is strictly positive on $(0, \\pi)$, $a_n > 0$ for all $n$.\nThus, we have a strictly decreasing sequence of positive terms:\n$$a_0 > a_1 > a_2 > \\dots > 0.$$\n\n#### Evaluating $f(x)$ at $x = k\\pi$\nFor any integer $k \\ge 1$, we can write $f(k\\pi)$ as a partial sum of an alternating series:\n$$f(k\\pi) = \\sum_{n=0}^{k-1} \\int_{n\\pi}^{(n+1)\\pi} e^{-t^2} \\sin(t) dt = \\sum_{n=0}^{k-1} (-1)^n a_n.$$\nSince the sequence $a_n$ is strictly decreasing ($a_n > a_{n+1} > 0$), the partial sums of this alternating series satisfy specific bounds:\n1.  **For odd $k$** (let $k = 2m+1$):\n    $$f((2m+1)\\pi) = (a_0 - a_1) + (a_2 - a_3) + \\dots + (a_{2m-2} - a_{2m-1}) + a_{2m}.$$\n    Each term in parentheses is positive ($a_i > a_{i+1}$), and $a_{2m} > 0$. Thus, **$f(x) > 0$ for $x = (2m+1)\\pi$**.\n2.  **For even $k$** (let $k = 2m$, $m \\ge 1$):\n    $$f(2m\\pi) = (a_0 - a_1) + (a_2 - a_3) + \\dots + (a_{2m-2} - a_{2m-1}).$$\n    Again, every term is positive. Thus, **$f(x) > 0$ for $x = 2m\\pi$**.\n\nWe have established that $f(k\\pi) > 0$ for all integers $k \\ge 1$.\n\n#### Evaluating $f(x)$ between multiples of $\\pi$\nConsider $x \\in (n\\pi, (n+1)\\pi)$.\nThe derivative of $f(x)$ is $f'(x) = e^{-x^2} \\sin(x)$.\n*   **Case 1: $n$ is even.**\n    On this interval, $\\sin(x) > 0$, so $f'(x) > 0$. The function is strictly increasing.\n    Since the starting value $f(n\\pi) > 0$ (as shown above for $n \\ge 1$, and $f(0)=0$ for $n=0$),\n    $$f(x) > f(n\\pi) \\ge 0.$$\n    Specifically for $x \\in (0, \\pi)$, $f(x) > f(0) = 0$. For $x \\in (2m\\pi, (2m+1)\\pi)$ with $m \\ge 1$, $f(x) > f(2m\\pi) > 0$.\n    Thus, $f(x) > 0$ in these intervals.\n\n*   **Case 2: $n$ is odd.**\n    On this interval, $\\sin(x) < 0$, so $f'(x) < 0$.

        "raw_answer": "To find the value(s) of $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ for which $f(x) = 0$, we analyze the properties of the function\n$$f(x) = \\int_{0}^{x} e^{-t^2} \\sin(t) dt.$$\n\n### 1. Verification of $x = 0$\nFirst, we evaluate the function at $x = 0$:\n$$f(0) = \\int_{0}^{0} e^{-t^2} \\sin(t) dt = 0.$$\nThus, **$x = 0$ is a solution**. We must now determine if there are any other real solutions.\n\n### 2. Symmetry Analysis\nLet $g(t) = e^{-t^2} \\sin(t)$.\nNotice that $e^{-t^2}$ is an even function and $\\sin(t)$ is an odd function. The product of an even function and an odd function is odd:\n$$g(-t) = e^{-(-t)^2} \\sin(-t) = e^{-t^2}(-\\sin(t)) = -g(t).$$\nSince the integrand $g(t)$ is an odd function, the integral $f(x) = \\int_{0}^{x} g(t) dt$ is an **even function**.\nProof:\n$$f(-x) = \\int_{0}^{-x} g(t) dt.$$\nLet $u = -t$, then $du = -dt$. The limits change from $0 \\to 0$ and $-x \\to x$.\n$$f(-x) = \\int_{0}^{x} g(-u) (-du) = \\int_{0}^{x} (-g(u)) (-du) = \\int_{0}^{x} g(u) du = f(x).$$\nSince $f(x)$ is even, $f(x) = 0 \\iff f(-x) = 0$. It suffices to determine the roots for $x > 0$. If we find that $f(x) \\neq 0$ for all $x > 0$, then by symmetry $f(x) \\neq 0$ for all $x < 0$.\n\n### 3. Analysis for $x > 0$\nWe analyze the behavior of the integral by decomposing the domain $[0, \\infty)$ into intervals of length $\\pi$:\n$$I_n = [n\\pi, (n+1)\\pi] \\quad \\text{for } n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$$\nLet $a_n$ be the absolute value of the integral over the interval $I_n$:\n$$a_n = \\left| \\int_{n\\pi}^{(n+1)\\pi} e^{-t^2} \\sin(t) dt \\right|.$$\nOn the interval $I_n$, let $t = n\\pi + u$ where $u \\in [0, \\pi]$. Then $\\sin(t) = \\sin(n\\pi + u) = (-1)^n \\sin(u)$.\nThe term $\\sin(u)$ is non-negative for $u \\in [0, \\pi]$. Thus, the integral over $I_n$ has the sign $(-1)^n$.\nWe can write $a_n$ explicitly as:\n$$a_n = \\int_{0}^{\\pi} e^{-(n\\pi + u)^2} \\sin(u) du.$$\n\n#### Lemma: The sequence $a_n$ is strictly decreasing.\nFor any fixed $u \\in (0, \\pi)$ and any integer $n \\ge 0$:\n$$(n\\pi + u)^2 < ((n+1)\\pi + u)^2$$\nSince the function $y \\mapsto e^{-y}$ is strictly decreasing,\n$$e^{-(n\\pi + u)^2} > e^{-((n+1)\\pi + u)^2}.$$\nMultiplying by $\\sin(u)$ (which is strictly positive for $u \\in (0, \\pi)$):\n$$e^{-(n\\pi + u)^2} \\sin(u) > e^{-((n+1)\\pi + u)^2} \\sin(u).$$\nIntegrating this inequality with respect to $u$ from $0$ to $\\pi$:\n$$a_n > a_{n+1}.$$\nFurthermore, since the integrand is strictly positive on $(0, \\pi)$, $a_n > 0$ for all $n$.\nThus, we have a strictly decreasing sequence of positive terms:\n$$a_0 > a_1 > a_2 > \\dots > 0.$$\n\n#### Evaluating $f(x)$ at $x = k\\pi$\nFor any integer $k \\ge 1$, we can write $f(k\\pi)$ as a partial sum of an alternating series:\n$$f(k\\pi) = \\sum_{n=0}^{k-1} \\int_{n\\pi}^{(n+1)\\pi} e^{-t^2} \\sin(t) dt = \\sum_{n=0}^{k-1} (-1)^n a_n.$$\nSince the sequence $a_n$ is strictly decreasing ($a_n > a_{n+1} > 0$), the partial sums of this alternating series satisfy specific bounds:\n1.  **For odd $k$** (let $k = 2m+1$):\n    $$f((2m+1)\\pi) = (a_0 - a_1) + (a_2 - a_3) + \\dots + (a_{2m-2} - a_{2m-1}) + a_{2m}.$$\n    Each term in parentheses is positive ($a_i > a_{i+1}$), and $a_{2m} > 0$. Thus, **$f(x) > 0$ for $x = (2m+1)\\pi$**.\n2.  **For even $k$** (let $k = 2m$, $m \\ge 1$):\n    $$f(2m\\pi) = (a_0 - a_1) + (a_2 - a_3) + \\dots + (a_{2m-2} - a_{2m-1}).$$\n    Again, every term is positive. Thus, **$f(x) > 0$ for $x = 2m\\pi$**.\n\nWe have established that $f(k\\pi) > 0$ for all integers $k \\ge 1$.\n\n#### Evaluating $f(x)$ between multiples of $\\pi$\nConsider $x \\in (n\\pi, (n+1)\\pi)$.\nThe derivative of $f(x)$ is $f'(x) = e^{-x^2} \\sin(x)$.\n*   **Case 1: $n$ is even.**\n    On this interval, $\\sin(x) > 0$, so $f'(x) > 0$. The function is strictly increasing.\n    Since the starting value $f(n\\pi) > 0$ (as shown above for $n \\ge 1$, and $f(0)=0$ for $n=0$),\n    $$f(x) > f(n\\pi) \\ge 0.$$\n    Specifically for $x \\in (0, \\pi)$, $f(x) > f(0) = 0$. For $x \\in (2m\\pi, (2m+1)\\pi)$ with $m \\ge 1$, $f(x) > f(2m\\pi) > 0$.\n    Thus, $f(x) > 0$ in these intervals.\n\n*   **Case 2: $n$ is odd.**\n    On this interval, $\\sin(x) < 0$, so $f'(x) < 0$. The function is strictly decreasing.\n    Since the function decreases, its infimum on the interval $[n\\pi, (n+1)\\pi]$ occurs at the right endpoint.\n    $$f(x) > f((n+1)\\pi).$$\n    From our previous analysis of integer multiples of $\\pi$, we know $f((n+1)\\pi) > 0$.\n    Therefore, $f(x) > 0$ in these intervals as well.\n\n### 4.

By definition, $U \\cap S$ is not connected.\nSince we found such a neighborhood $U$, $p \\in \\partial S$.\nSince $p$ was arbitrary, $\\partial S = M$.\nThe set $M$ is a closed subset of itself.\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nWe have exhaustively classified the set $\\partial S$ based on the properties of $S$:\n1.  If $|S| < 2$, then $\\partial S = \\emptyset$.\n2.  If $|S| \\ge 2$, then $\\partial S = M$.\n\nIn standard topology, both the empty set $\\emptyset$ and the entire space $M$ are closed sets.\nTherefore, in all cases, $\\partial S$ is a closed subset of $M$.\n\n**Final Proof Statement:**\nThe set $\\partial S$ is either empty or the entire manifold $M$. Since both $\\emptyset$ and $M$ are closed sets, $\\partial S$ is a closed subset of $M$.",

Determine the Support of $Y$\n\nThe random variable $X$ is defined on the interval $[0, 1]$.
