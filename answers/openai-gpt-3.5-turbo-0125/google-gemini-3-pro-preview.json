We can write $n = m(p-1) + 1$ for some integer $m$.\n   Using Fermat's Little Theorem ($2^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$):\n   $$2^n = 2^{m(p-1) + 1} = (2^{p-1})^m \\cdot 2^1 \\equiv 1^m \\cdot 2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{p}$$\n\n2. **Evaluate $n \\pmod{p}$:**\n   From the second congruence, we are given directly that:\n   $$n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{p}$$\n\n3. **Combine results:**\n   Subtracting the two results modulo $p$:\n   $$2^n - n \\equiv 2 - 2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$$\n\nThus, $p \\mid 2^n - n$ for all $n$ in the infinite arithmetic progression constructed.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn both cases ($p=2$ and $p$ odd), we have demonstrated the existence of an infinite set of positive integers $n$ such that $p \\mid 2^n - n$.\n\n**Q.E.D.**",

For a quartic $x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$, the resolvent cubic is given by:\n$$ R(z) = z^3 - bz^2 + (ac - 4d)z - (a^2d - 4bd + c^2) $$\nSubstituting $a=-3, b=4, c=-6, d=2$:\n- $ac - 4d = (-3)(-6) - 4(2) = 18 - 8 = 10$\n- $a^2d - 4bd + c^2 = (-3)^2(2) - 4(4)(2) + (-6)^2 = 18 - 32 + 36 = 22$\n$$ R(z) = z^3 - 4z^2 + 10z - 22 $$\nWe check for rational roots of $R(z)$ using the Rational Root Theorem (divisors of 22: $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 11, \\pm 22$).\n- $R(1) = 1 - 4 + 10 - 22 \\neq 0$\n- $R(2) = 8 - 16 + 20 - 22 = -10 \\neq 0$\n- ... and similarly for others.\n$R(z)$ has no rational roots and is cubic, so it is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThe discriminant of $f(x)$ is equal to the discriminant of $R(z)$. A computation yields $\\Delta = -5260$. Since $\\Delta < 0$, it is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nFor an irreducible quartic with an irreducible resolvent cubic and a non-square discriminant, the Galois group is the symmetric group $S_4$.\n$$ [K:\\mathbb{Q}] = |S_4| = 24 $$\n\n### Case 2: $F = \\mathbb{R}$ (The Field of Real Numbers)\nIf $F = \\mathbb{R}$, the degree is **2**.\n\nWe analyze the roots of $f(x)$ using calculus.\n$f'(x) = 4x^3 - 9x^2 + 8x - 6$.\nEvaluating $f(x)$ at specific points:\n- $f(0) = 2$\n- $f(1) = 1 - 3 + 4 - 6 + 2 = -2$ (Change of sign $\\implies$ real root in $(0,1)$)\n- $f(2) = 16 - 24 + 16 - 12 + 2 = -2$\n- $f(3) = 81 - 81 + 36 - 18 + 2 = 20$ (Change of sign $\\implies$ real root in $(2,3)$)\nThe polynomial has at least two real roots. Since the degree is 4, the other two roots must be complex conjugates (as they are not real). Let the roots be $r_1, r_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $z, \\bar{z} \\in \\mathbb{C} \\setminus \\mathbb{R}$.\nThe splitting field is $K = \\mathbb{R}(r_1, r_2, z, \\bar{z}) = \\mathbb{R}(z) = \\mathbb{C}$.\n$$ [K:\\mathbb{R}] = [\\mathbb{C}:\\mathbb{R}] = 2 $$\n\n### Case 3: $F = \\mathbb{F}_2$ (The Field with 2 Elements)\nIf $F = \\mathbb{F}_2$, the degree is **1**.\n\nReducing coefficients modulo 2:\n$$ f(x) = x^4 + x^3 \\in \\mathbb{F}_2[x] $$\n$$ f(x) = x^3(x+1) $$\nThe roots are $0, 0, 0, 1$, which are all elements of $\\mathbb{F}_2$. The polynomial splits completely in $F$.\n$$ [K:F] = 1 $$\n\n### Conclusion\nBecause the computed degree varies (24, 2, or 1) depending on the choice of the field $F$, and the question does not specify $F$, the question is missing a necessary constraint and cannot be answered uniquely.",

Let the two branches be defined by the functions:\n$$ y_1(x) = (x-1)\\sqrt{x+2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y_2(x) = -(x-1)\\sqrt{x+2} $$\nDifferentiating $y_1(x)$ with respect to $x$:\n$$ y_1'(x) = 1 \\cdot \\sqrt{x+2} + (x-1) \\frac{d}{dx}(\\sqrt{x+2}) $$\n$$ y_1'(x) = \\sqrt{x+2} + (x-1) \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{x+2}} $$\nEvaluating at $x = 1$:\n$$ m_1 = y_1'(1) = \\sqrt{1+2} + (0) = \\sqrt{3} $$\nSimilarly for $y_2(x) = -y_1(x)$, the slope is:\n$$ m_2 = y_2'(1) = -\\sqrt{3} $$\n\nAlternatively, using the tangent cone method (analyzing lowest degree terms):\nLet $u = x - 1$ and $v = y$. Substituting $x = u + 1$ into the curve equation:\n$$ v^2 = (u+1)^3 - 3(u+1) + 2 $$\n$$ v^2 = (u^3 + 3u^2 + 3u + 1) - 3u - 3 + 2 $$\n$$ v^2 = u^3 + 3u^2 $$\n$$ v^2 - 3u^2 - u^3 = 0 $$\nThe lowest degree terms form the equation of the tangent cone (the union of the tangent lines) at the origin of the $(u, v)$ system:\n$$ v^2 - 3u^2 = 0 $$\n$$ (v - \\sqrt{3}u)(v + \\sqrt{3}u) = 0 $$\nSubstituting back $v = y$ and $u = x - 1$, we get the two lines:\n$$ y = \\sqrt{3}(x-1) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y = -\\sqrt{3}(x-1) $$\n\n### Conclusion\nThe question asks for \"the equation of the tangent line,\" implying a unique solution. However, because $P(1, 0)$ is a singular point (specifically a node) where the curve intersects itself, a unique tangent line does not exist. Instead, there are two tangent lines corresponding to the two branches of the curve passing through $P$.\n\nThe equations of the two tangent lines are:\n$$ y = \\sqrt{3}x - \\sqrt{3} $$\n$$ y = -\\sqrt{3}x + \\sqrt{3} $$",

Mathematical Context and Definitions\n\n**Spaces and Algebras:**\n*   Let $X$ be a compact Hausdorff space. Let $C(X)$ denote the $C^*$-algebra of continuous complex-valued functions on $X$. Since $X$ is compact, $C(X)$ is unital with identity element $1_X$ (the constant function $x \\mapsto 1$).\n*   Let $A$ be a separable $C^*$-algebra.\n*   The target group $K(X, A)$ is interpreted in the standard sense of operator $K$-theory as the $K_0$-group of the $C^*$-algebra of continuous functions from $X$ to $A$, denoted $C(X, A)$.\n*   There is a canonical isomorphism $C(X, A) \\cong A \\otimes C(X)$.

The question defines $\\phi$ on elements of the form $[p]$. We must show this assignment is consistent with the equivalence relations defining $K_0(A)$.\n\n### 2. Construction of the Homomorphism\n\nWe identify $\\phi$ as the map induced by a specific $*$-homomorphism between $C^*$-algebras.\n\n**Step 1: Define the Constant Embedding**\nConsider the map $\\iota: A \\to C(X, A)$ defined by sending an element $a \\in A$ to the constant function on $X$ with value $a$:\n$$ \\iota(a)(x) = a \\quad \\text{for all } x \\in X. $$\nIn the tensor product picture $A \\otimes C(X)$, this map is given by $a \\mapsto a \\otimes 1_X$.\n\n**Step 2: Verify $\\iota$ is a $*$-homomorphism**\nThe map $\\iota$ preserves the algebraic structure:\n*   **Linearity**: $\\iota(\\lambda a + b) = (\\lambda a + b) \\otimes 1_X = \\lambda(a \\otimes 1_X) + (b \\otimes 1_X) = \\lambda \\iota(a) + \\iota(b)$.\n*   **Multiplication**: $\\iota(ab) = (ab) \\otimes 1_X = (a \\otimes 1_X)(b \\otimes 1_X) = \\iota(a)\\iota(b)$ (since $1_X \\cdot 1_X = 1_X$).\n*   **Involution**: $\\iota(a^*) = a^* \\otimes 1_X = (a \\otimes 1_X)^* = \\iota(a)^*$.\n\nThus, $\\iota$ is a $*$-homomorphism.\n\n**Step 3: Functoriality of $K_0$**\nThe $K_0$ construction is a covariant functor from the category of $C^*$-algebras to the category of Abelian groups. Therefore, any $*$-homomorphism $\\psi: A \\to B$ induces a well-defined group homomorphism $K_0(\\psi): K_0(A) \\to K_0(B)$.\n\nApplying this to $\\iota$, we obtain a well-defined homomorphism:\n$$ K_0(\\iota): K_0(A) \\to K_0(C(X, A)). $$\nFor a class $[p] \\in K_0(A)$ represented by a projection $p \\in M_n(A)$, the induced map is given by:\n$$ K_0(\\iota)([p]) = [\\iota(p)]. $$\nHere, $\\iota(p)$ is applying $\\iota$ entry-wise to the matrix $p$. The result is the constant matrix-valued function $x \\mapsto p$, which is exactly $p \\otimes 1_X$ in $M_n(A) \\otimes C(X)$.\n\nThus, $K_0(\\iota)([p]) = [p \\otimes 1_X]$. This matches the definition of $\\phi([p])$ given in the problem statement.\n\n### 3. Direct Verification of Well-Definedness\n\nTo ensure rigor, we explicitly verify that the map respects the equivalence relations in $K_0(A)$ without solely relying on the functoriality statement.\n\n**Requirement:**\nWe must show that if $[p] = [q]$ in $K_0(A)$, then $[p \\otimes 1_X] = [q \\otimes 1_X]$ in $K(X, A)$.\n\n**Proof:**\n1.  **Relation in $K_0(A)$**: The equality $[p] = [q]$ in the Grothendieck group $K_0(A)$ holds if and only if $p$ and $q$ are stably equivalent. That is, there exist a projection $r \\in M_k(A)$ and an integer $n$ such that:\n    $$ p \\oplus r \\sim_0 q \\oplus r \\quad \\text{in } M_{n+k}(A). $$\n    Here $\\sim_0$ denotes Murray-von Neumann equivalence.\n\n2.  **Murray-von Neumann Equivalence**: The condition $p \\oplus r \\sim_0 q \\oplus r$ implies there exists a partial isometry $v \\in M_{n+k}(A)$ such that:\n    $$ v^*v = p \\oplus r \\quad \\text{and} \\quad vv^* = q \\oplus r. $$\n\n3.  **Mapping to $C(X, A)$**: Apply the map $\\iota$ (tensoring with $1_X$) to these elements. Let $V = v \\otimes 1_X$, $P = p \\otimes 1_X$, $Q = q \\otimes 1_X$, and $R = r \\otimes 1_X$.\n    Compute the products in $M_{n+k}(C(X, A))$:\n    $$ V^*V = (v^* \\otimes 1_X)(v \\otimes 1_X) = (v^*v) \\otimes 1_X = (p \\oplus r) \\otimes 1_X = P \\oplus R. $$\n    $$ VV^* = (v \\otimes 1_X)(v^* \\otimes 1_X) = (vv^*) \\otimes 1_X = (q \\oplus r) \\otimes 1_X = Q \\oplus R. $$\n\n4.  **Conclusion in Target Group**:\n    The existence of $V$ shows that $P \\oplus R \\sim_0 Q \\oplus R$ in the algebra $M_{n+k}(C(X, A))$.\n    This implies $[P \\oplus R] = [Q \\oplus R]$ in the semigroup $V(C(X, A))$.\n    In the group $K_0(C(X, A))$, this translates to:\n    $$ [P] + [R] = [Q] + [R]. $$\n    Since $K_0(C(X, A))$ is a group, we can cancel $[R]$ from both sides to obtain:\n    $$ [P] = [Q] \\implies [p \\otimes 1_X] = [q \\otimes 1_X]. $$\n\n**Additivity:**\nFinally, we check $\\phi$ is a homomorphism:\n$$ \\phi([p] + [q]) = \\phi([p \\oplus q]) = [(p \\oplus q) \\otimes 1_X]. $$\n$$ \\phi([p]) + \\phi([q]) = [p \\otimes 1_X] + [q \\otimes 1_X] = [(p \\otimes 1_X) \\oplus (q \\otimes 1_X)]. $$\nNote that $(p \\oplus q) \\otimes 1_X = \\text{diag}(p, q) \\otimes 1_X = \\text{diag}(p \\otimes 1_X, q \\otimes 1_X) = (p \\otimes 1_X) \\oplus (q \\otimes 1_X)$.\nThus, $\\phi([p] + [q]) = \\phi([p]) + \\phi([q])$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe map $\\phi$ is the homomorphism induced on the $K_0$-groups by the $*$-homomorphism $\\iota: A \\to A \\otimes C(X)$ defined by $a \\mapsto a \\otimes 1_X$. As the induced map of a $*$-homomorphism, it preserves the equivalence relations defining the $K_0$ group and the group operation.\n\nTherefore, **$\\phi$ is a well-defined group homomorphism.**",

Let $V = v \\otimes 1_X$, $P = p \\otimes 1_X$, $Q = q \\otimes 1_X$, and $R = r \\otimes 1_X$.\n    Compute the products in $M_{n+k}(C(X, A))$:\n    $$ V^*V = (v^* \\otimes 1_X)(v \\otimes 1_X) = (v^*v) \\otimes 1_X = (p \\oplus r) \\otimes 1_X = P \\oplus R. $$\n    $$ VV^* = (v \\otimes 1_X)(v^* \\otimes 1_X) = (vv^*) \\otimes 1_X = (q \\oplus r) \\otimes 1_X = Q \\oplus R. $$\n\n4.  **Conclusion in Target Group**:\n    The existence of $V$ shows that $P \\oplus R \\sim_0 Q \\oplus R$ in the algebra $M_{n+k}(C(X, A))$.\n    This implies $[P \\oplus R] = [Q \\oplus R]$ in the semigroup $V(C(X, A))$.\n    In the group $K_0(C(X, A))$, this translates to:\n    $$ [P] + [R] = [Q] + [R]. $$\n    Since $K_0(C(X, A))$ is a group, we can cancel $[R]$ from both sides to obtain:\n    $$ [P] = [Q] \\implies [p \\otimes 1_X] = [q \\otimes 1_X]. $$\n\n**Additivity:**\nFinally, we check $\\phi$ is a homomorphism:\n$$ \\phi([p] + [q]) = \\phi([p \\oplus q]) = [(p \\oplus q) \\otimes 1_X]. $$\n$$ \\phi([p]) + \\phi([q]) = [p \\otimes 1_X] + [q \\otimes 1_X] = [(p \\otimes 1_X) \\oplus (q \\otimes 1_X)]. $$\nNote that $(p \\oplus q) \\otimes 1_X = \\text{diag}(p, q) \\otimes 1_X = \\text{diag}(p \\otimes 1_X, q \\otimes 1_X) = (p \\otimes 1_X) \\oplus (q \\otimes 1_X)$.\nThus, $\\phi([p] + [q]) = \\phi([p]) + \\phi([q])$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe map $\\phi$ is the homomorphism induced on the $K_0$-groups by the $*$-homomorphism $\\iota: A \\to A \\otimes C(X)$ defined by $a \\mapsto a \\otimes 1_X$. As the induced map of a $*$-homomorphism, it preserves the equivalence relations defining the $K_0$ group and the group operation.\n\nTherefore, **$\\phi$ is a well-defined group homomorphism.**",

        "answer": "To find the value of $f(2022)$, we will analyze the given functional equation and derive the explicit form of the function $f(x)$.\n\n### 1. Analyzing the Functional Equation\n\nWe are given the functional equation:\n$$f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y) + 2xy \\quad \\text{for all } x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$$\nWe are also given that $f$ is continuous and $f(1) = 3$.\n\nThe term $2xy$ suggests that $f(x)$ contains a quadratic term. Recall that $(x+y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy$. This identity shares the $2xy$ structure with our functional equation. This motivates us to define an auxiliary function to simplify the equation.\n\nLet us define a new function $g: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ as:\n$$g(x) = f(x) - x^2$$\n\nSince $f(x)$ is continuous and $x^2$ is continuous, $g(x)$ is also a continuous function.\n\n### 2. Deriving the Equation for the Auxiliary Function\n\nWe substitute $f(x) = g(x) + x^2$ into the original functional equation.\n\n**Left-hand side (LHS):**\n$$f(x+y) = g(x+y) + (x+y)^2 = g(x+y) + x^2 + 2xy + y^2$$\n\n**Right-hand side (RHS):**\n$$f(x) + f(y) + 2xy = (g(x) + x^2) + (g(y) + y^2) + 2xy$$\n$$= g(x) + g(y) + x^2 + y^2 + 2xy$$\n\nEquating the LHS and RHS:\n$$g(x+y) + x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = g(x) + g(y) + x^2 + y^2 + 2xy$$\n\nSubtracting $x^2 + y^2 + 2xy$ from both sides, we obtain:\n$$g(x+y) = g(x) + g(y)$$\n\n### 3.

        "raw_answer": "To find the value of $f(2022)$, we will analyze the given functional equation and derive the explicit form of the function $f(x)$.\n\n### 1. Analyzing the Functional Equation\n\nWe are given the functional equation:\n$$f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y) + 2xy \\quad \\text{for all } x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$$\nWe are also given that $f$ is continuous and $f(1) = 3$.\n\nThe term $2xy$ suggests that $f(x)$ contains a quadratic term. Recall that $(x+y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy$. This identity shares the $2xy$ structure with our functional equation. This motivates us to define an auxiliary function to simplify the equation.\n\nLet us define a new function $g: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ as:\n$$g(x) = f(x) - x^2$$\n\nSince $f(x)$ is continuous and $x^2$ is continuous, $g(x)$ is also a continuous function.\n\n### 2.

Definition and Behavior at $x=0$\n\nThe Bessel function of the first kind of integer order $n \\ge 0$ is defined by the series expansion:\n$$ J_n(x) = \\sum_{m=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^m}{m! \\, \\Gamma(m+n+1)} \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^{2m+n} $$\nSubstituting $n=2$:\n$$ J_2(x) = \\sum_{m=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^m}{m! \\, (m+2)!} \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^{2m+2} $$\nThe first term of this series (where $m=0$) is:\n$$ \\frac{(-1)^0}{0! \\, 2!} \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{x^2}{4} = \\frac{x^2}{8} $$\nSince every term in the series contains a factor of $x^k$ with $k \\ge 2$, it is evident that $J_2(0) = 0$.\n\n**Conclusion 1:** $x = 0$ is a solution.\n\n### 2. Symmetry of Solutions\n\nWe examine the parity of the function $J_2(x)$. Using the property $J_n(-x) = (-1)^n J_n(x)$ for integer $n$:\n$$ J_2(-x) = (-1)^2 J_2(x) = J_2(x) $$\nThis shows that $J_2(x)$ is an even function. Consequently, the non-zero solutions appear in pairs: if $x = \\alpha$ is a solution, then $x = -\\alpha$ is also a solution.\n\n### 3. Positive Real Zeros\n\nAccording to the general theory of Bessel functions (specifically, the Sturm-Liouville theory applied to Bessel's differential equation), the function $J_n(x)$ for real $n$ has infinitely many real zeros.\n\nLet the sequence of positive simple zeros of $J_2(x)$ be denoted by $j_{2,k}$ for $k = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$, ordered such that:\n$$ 0 < j_{2,1} < j_{2,2} < j_{2,3} < \\dots $$\n\nThese values are transcendental numbers and do not have closed-form expressions in terms of elementary functions. Their approximate values can be determined numerically or via asymptotic formulas. For large $k$, the zeros approximate to:\n$$ j_{2,k} \\approx \\left(k + \\frac{2}{2} - \\frac{1}{4}\\right)\\pi = \\left(k + \\frac{3}{4}\\right)\\pi $$\n\nThe first few positive zeros are approximately:\n- $j_{2,1} \\approx 5.1356$\n- $j_{2,2} \\approx 8.4172$\n- $j_{2,3} \\approx 11.6198$\n\n### 4. Completeness of the Solution Set\n\nLommel's Theorem guarantees that for $n > -1$, all zeros of $J_n(x)$ are real. Since $n=2$, there are no complex non-real roots.

Definition and Behavior at $x=0$\n\nThe Bessel function of the first kind of integer order $n \\ge 0$ is defined by the series expansion:\n$$ J_n(x) = \\sum_{m=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^m}{m! \\, \\Gamma(m+n+1)} \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^{2m+n} $$\nSubstituting $n=2$:\n$$ J_2(x) = \\sum_{m=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^m}{m! \\, (m+2)!} \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^{2m+2} $$\nThe first term of this series (where $m=0$) is:\n$$ \\frac{(-1)^0}{0! \\, 2!} \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{x^2}{4} = \\frac{x^2}{8} $$\nSince every term in the series contains a factor of $x^k$ with $k \\ge 2$, it is evident that $J_2(0) = 0$.\n\n**Conclusion 1:** $x = 0$ is a solution.\n\n### 2. Symmetry of Solutions\n\nWe examine the parity of the function $J_2(x)$. Using the property $J_n(-x) = (-1)^n J_n(x)$ for integer $n$:\n$$ J_2(-x) = (-1)^2 J_2(x) = J_2(x) $$\nThis shows that $J_2(x)$ is an even function. Consequently, the non-zero solutions appear in pairs: if $x = \\alpha$ is a solution, then $x = -\\alpha$ is also a solution.\n\n### 3. Positive Real Zeros\n\nAccording to the general theory of Bessel functions (specifically, the Sturm-Liouville theory applied to Bessel's differential equation), the function $J_n(x)$ for real $n$ has infinitely many real zeros.\n\nLet the sequence of positive simple zeros of $J_2(x)$ be denoted by $j_{2,k}$ for $k = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$, ordered such that:\n$$ 0 < j_{2,1} < j_{2,2} < j_{2,3} < \\dots $$\n\nThese values are transcendental numbers and do not have closed-form expressions in terms of elementary functions. Their approximate values can be determined numerically or via asymptotic formulas. For large $k$, the zeros approximate to:\n$$ j_{2,k} \\approx \\left(k + \\frac{2}{2} - \\frac{1}{4}\\right)\\pi = \\left(k + \\frac{3}{4}\\right)\\pi $$\n\nThe first few positive zeros are approximately:\n- $j_{2,1} \\approx 5.1356$\n- $j_{2,2} \\approx 8.4172$\n- $j_{2,3} \\approx 11.6198$\n\n### 4. Completeness of the Solution Set\n\nLommel's Theorem guarantees that for $n > -1$, all zeros of $J_n(x)$ are real. Since $n=2$, there are no complex non-real roots.

We will then use Fourier analysis to prove the ergodicity condition.\n\n### 1. Mathematical Formulation\n\n**The Dynamical System:**\nLet $X = [0, 1)$. The transformation is given by the doubling map $T: X \\to X$:\n$$T(x) = 2x \\pmod 1 = \\begin{cases} 2x & \\text{if } 0 \\leq x < 1/2 \\\\ 2x - 1 & \\text{if } 1/2 \\leq x < 1 \\end{cases}$$\n\n**The Measure Space:**\nWe consider the probability space $(X, \\mathcal{B}, \\mu)$, where $\\mathcal{B}$ is the Borel $\\sigma$-algebra on $[0, 1)$ and $\\mu$ is the Lebesgue measure.\n\n**Definition of Ergodicity:**\nThe transformation $T$ is **ergodic** with respect to $\\mu$ if for every invariant set $E \\in \\mathcal{B}$ (i.e., $T^{-1}(E) = E$), we have either $\\mu(E) = 0$ or $\\mu(E) = 1$.\n\nAn equivalent and often more convenient characterization involves $L^2$ functions: $T$ is ergodic if and only if every function $f \\in L^2(X, \\mu)$ that satisfies $f \\circ T = f$ almost everywhere is constant almost everywhere.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Measure Preservation\n\nFirst, we verify that $T$ preserves the Lebesgue measure $\\mu$. A transformation $T$ is measure-preserving if $\\mu(T^{-1}(E)) = \\mu(E)$ for all $E \\in \\mathcal{B}$. It suffices to check this for intervals $[a, b) \\subset [0, 1)$.\n\nThe preimage of an interval $[a, b)$ under $T$ is:\n$$T^{-1}([a, b)) = \\{x \\in [0, 1) : 2x \\pmod 1 \\in [a, b)\\}$$\nThis condition holds if $2x \\in [a, b)$ or $2x \\in [1+a, 1+b)$.\nSolving for $x$:\n$$x \\in \\left[\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{b}{2}\\right) \\cup \\left[\\frac{1+a}{2}, \\frac{1+b}{2}\\right)$$\nThese two intervals are disjoint. The measure of the preimage is the sum of their lengths:\n$$\\mu(T^{-1}([a, b))) = \\left(\\frac{b}{2} - \\frac{a}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1+b}{2} - \\frac{1+a}{2}\\right) = \\frac{b-a}{2} + \\frac{b-a}{2} = b-a = \\mu([a, b))$$\nSince $T$ preserves the measure of intervals, it preserves the Lebesgue measure on all Borel sets.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Proof of Ergodicity via Fourier Series\n\nWe use the spectral characterization of ergodicity. Let $f \\in L^2([0, 1))$ be an invariant function, meaning $f(T(x)) = f(x)$ for almost every $x$. We must show that $f$ is constant almost everywhere.\n\n**Step 3.1: Fourier Expansion**\nSince $f \\in L^2([0, 1))$, we can express it as a Fourier series:\n$$f(x) = \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}} c_n e^{2\\pi i n x}$$\nwhere the convergence is in the $L^2$ norm, and the coefficients are given by $c_n = \\int_0^1 f(x) e^{-2\\pi i n x} dx$.\n\n**Step 3.2: Applying the Invariance Condition**\nConsider the function $f \\circ T$. Substituting $T(x) = 2x \\pmod 1$:\n$$f(T(x)) = \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}} c_n e^{2\\pi i n (2x \\pmod 1)}$$\nSince $e^{2\\pi i k} = 1$ for any integer $k$, the modulo 1 does not affect the exponential term:\n$$e^{2\\pi i n (2x)} = e^{4\\pi i n x}$$\nThus, the Fourier series for the composition is:\n$$f(T(x)) = \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}} c_n e^{2\\pi i (2n) x}$$\n\n**Step 3.3: Comparing Coefficients**\nBy the hypothesis $f(T(x)) = f(x)$ almost everywhere, the Fourier series of both sides must be identical. By the uniqueness of Fourier coefficients, we equate the coefficient of $e^{2\\pi i m x}$ on both sides.\n\nLet the Fourier coefficients of $f(x)$ be denoted by $c_m$ and the coefficients of $f(T(x))$ be denoted by $d_m$.\nFrom the expansion of $f(T(x))$, the term $e^{2\\pi i m x}$ appears only when $m$ is of the form $2n$.\nTherefore:\n- If $m$ is odd, $d_m = 0$.\n- If $m$ is even (let $m=2n$), $d_{2n} = c_n$.\n\nEquating $c_m = d_m$:\n1.

        "raw_answer": "To prove that the discrete dynamical system $x_{n+1} = 2x_n \\pmod 1$ is ergodic, we must first specify the measure space and show that the transformation preserves the measure. We will then use Fourier analysis to prove the ergodicity condition.\n\n### 1. Mathematical Formulation\n\n**The Dynamical System:**\nLet $X = [0, 1)$. The transformation is given by the doubling map $T: X \\to X$:\n$$T(x) = 2x \\pmod 1 = \\begin{cases} 2x & \\text{if } 0 \\leq x < 1/2 \\\\ 2x - 1 & \\text{if } 1/2 \\leq x < 1 \\end{cases}$$\n\n**The Measure Space:**\nWe consider the probability space $(X, \\mathcal{B}, \\mu)$, where $\\mathcal{B}$ is the Borel $\\sigma$-algebra on $[0, 1)$ and $\\mu$ is the Lebesgue measure.\n\n**Definition of Ergodicity:**\nThe transformation $T$ is **ergodic** with respect to $\\mu$ if for every invariant set $E \\in \\mathcal{B}$ (i.e., $T^{-1}(E) = E$), we have either $\\mu(E) = 0$ or $\\mu(E) = 1$.\n\nAn equivalent and often more convenient characterization involves $L^2$ functions: $T$ is ergodic if and only if every function $f \\in L^2(X, \\mu)$ that satisfies $f \\circ T = f$ almost everywhere is constant almost everywhere.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Measure Preservation\n\nFirst, we verify that $T$ preserves the Lebesgue measure $\\mu$. A transformation $T$ is measure-preserving if $\\mu(T^{-1}(E)) = \\mu(E)$ for all $E \\in \\mathcal{B}$. It suffices to check this for intervals $[a, b) \\subset [0, 1)$.\n\nThe preimage of an interval $[a, b)$ under $T$ is:\n$$T^{-1}([a, b)) = \\{x \\in [0, 1) : 2x \\pmod 1 \\in [a, b)\\}$$\nThis condition holds if $2x \\in [a, b)$ or $2x \\in [1+a, 1+b)$.\nSolving for $x$:\n$$x \\in \\left[\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{b}{2}\\right) \\cup \\left[\\frac{1+a}{2}, \\frac{1+b}{2}\\right)$$\nThese two intervals are disjoint. The measure of the preimage is the sum of their lengths:\n$$\\mu(T^{-1}([a, b))) = \\left(\\frac{b}{2} - \\frac{a}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1+b}{2} - \\frac{1+a}{2}\\right) = \\frac{b-a}{2} + \\frac{b-a}{2} = b-a = \\mu([a, b))$$\nSince $T$ preserves the measure of intervals, it preserves the Lebesgue measure on all Borel sets.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Proof of Ergodicity via Fourier Series\n\nWe use the spectral characterization of ergodicity. Let $f \\in L^2([0, 1))$ be an invariant function, meaning $f(T(x)) = f(x)$ for almost every $x$. We must show that $f$ is constant almost everywhere.\n\n**Step 3.1: Fourier Expansion**\nSince $f \\in L^2([0, 1))$, we can express it as a Fourier series:\n$$f(x) = \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}} c_n e^{2\\pi i n x}$$\nwhere the convergence is in the $L^2$ norm, and the coefficients are given by $c_n = \\int_0^1 f(x) e^{-2\\pi i n x} dx$.\n\n**Step 3.2: Applying the Invariance Condition**\nConsider the function $f \\circ T$. Substituting $T(x) = 2x \\pmod 1$:\n$$f(T(x)) = \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}} c_n e^{2\\pi i n (2x \\pmod 1)}$$\nSince $e^{2\\pi i k} = 1$ for any integer $k$, the modulo 1 does not affect the exponential term:\n$$e^{2\\pi i n (2x)} = e^{4\\pi i n x}$$\nThus, the Fourier series for the composition is:\n$$f(T(x)) = \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}} c_n e^{2\\pi i (2n) x}$$\n\n**Step 3.3: Comparing Coefficients**\nBy the hypothesis $f(T(x)) = f(x)$ almost everywhere, the Fourier series of both sides must be identical. By the uniqueness of Fourier coefficients, we equate the coefficient of $e^{2\\pi i m x}$ on both sides.\n\nLet the Fourier coefficients of $f(x)$ be denoted by $c_m$ and the coefficients of $f(T(x))$ be denoted by $d_m$.\nFrom the expansion of $f(T(x))$, the term $e^{2\\pi i m x}$ appears only when $m$ is of the form $2n$.\nTherefore:\n- If $m$ is odd, $d_m = 0$.\n- If $m$ is even (let $m=2n$), $d_{2n} = c_n$.\n\nEquating $c_m = d_m$:\n1. For any odd integer $m$, $c_m = 0$.\n2. For any even integer $m=2n$, $c_{2n} = c_n$.\n\n**Step 3.4: Iterative Deduction**\nWe now show that $c_m = 0$ for all $m \\neq 0$.\nLet $m$ be a non-zero integer. We can write $m$ uniquely as $m = 2^k \\cdot l$, where $k \\geq 0$ is an integer and $l$ is an odd integer.\nUsing the relation $c_{2n} = c_n$ repeatedly:\n$$c_m = c_{2^k l} = c_{2^{k-1} l} = \\dots = c_l$$\nSince $l$ is odd, we know from condition (1) above that $c_l = 0$.\nTherefore, $c_m = 0$ for all $m \\neq 0$.\n\n**Step 3.5: Conclusion**\nSince all Fourier coefficients $c_m$ are zero for $m \\neq 0$, the Fourier series reduces to:\n$$f(x) = c_0$$\nThis holds in the $L^2$ sense, which implies $f(x) = c_0$ almost everywhere.\n\nSince the only $T$-invariant functions in $L^2$ are constants (a.e.), the transformation $T$ is ergodic.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe dynamical system $x_{n+1} = 2x_n \\pmod 1$ preserves the Lebesgue measure, and the only invariant sets have measure 0 or 1.

Since $\\widehat{G}$ is a topological group, the neighborhoods of an arbitrary point $\\xi_0 \\in \\widehat{G}$ are translations of these basis sets, i.e., $\\xi_0 + N(K, \\epsilon)$.\n\n### 2. Proof of Continuity\n\nLet $f: G \\to \\mathbb{C}$ be a continuous function with compact support. We denote the support of $f$ by $K = \\text{supp}(f)$. Since $f$ is continuous and $K$ is compact, $f$ is bounded. Since $K$ is compact, $f \\in L^1(G)$.\n\nWe wish to show that $\\hat{f}$ is continuous at an arbitrary point $\\xi_0 \\in \\widehat{G}$.\n\n**Step 1: Formulate the difference**\nFix $\\xi_0 \\in \\widehat{G}$ and let $\\epsilon > 0$. We evaluate the magnitude of the difference $|\\hat{f}(\\xi) - \\hat{f}(\\xi_0)|$ for an arbitrary $\\xi \\in \\widehat{G}$:\n$$ |\\hat{f}(\\xi) - \\hat{f}(\\xi_0)| = \\left| \\int_{G} f(x) \\overline{\\chi(\\xi, x)} \\, dx - \\int_{G} f(x) \\overline{\\chi(\\xi_0, x)} \\, dx \\right| $$\nBy linearity of the integral, we combine terms:\n$$ = \\left| \\int_{G} f(x) \\left( \\overline{\\chi(\\xi, x)} - \\overline{\\chi(\\xi_0, x)} \\right) \\, dx \\right| $$\nApplying the triangle inequality for integrals:\n$$ \\leq \\int_{G} |f(x)| \\left| \\overline{\\chi(\\xi, x)} - \\overline{\\chi(\\xi_0, x)} \\right| \\, dx $$\nSince $f$ vanishes outside the compact set $K$, the domain of integration restricts to $K$:\n$$ = \\int_{K} |f(x)| \\left| \\overline{\\chi(\\xi, x)} - \\overline{\\chi(\\xi_0, x)} \\right| \\, dx $$\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the character term**\nRecall that $|\\bar{z}| = |z|$. Thus:\n$$ \\left| \\overline{\\chi(\\xi, x)} - \\overline{\\chi(\\xi_0, x)} \\right| = \\left| \\chi(\\xi, x) - \\chi(\\xi_0, x) \\right| $$\nUsing the homomorphism property $\\chi(\\xi, x) = \\chi(\\xi_0 + (\\xi - \\xi_0), x) = \\chi(\\xi_0, x)\\chi(\\xi - \\xi_0, x)$:\n$$ \\left| \\chi(\\xi, x) - \\chi(\\xi_0, x) \\right| = \\left| \\chi(\\xi_0, x) \\left( \\chi(\\xi - \\xi_0, x) - 1 \\right) \\right| $$\nSince characters map to $\\mathbb{T}$, $|\\chi(\\xi_0, x)| = 1$. Therefore:\n$$ \\left| \\chi(\\xi, x) - \\chi(\\xi_0, x) \\right| = \\left| \\chi(\\xi - \\xi_0, x) - 1 \\right| $$\nLet $\\eta = \\xi - \\xi_0$. The expression becomes:\n$$ |\\hat{f}(\\xi) - \\hat{f}(\\xi_0)| \\leq \\int_{K} |f(x)| \\left| \\chi(\\eta, x) - 1 \\right| \\, dx $$\n\n**Step 3: Construct the neighborhood**\nLet $\\|f\\|_1 = \\int_G |f(x)| \\, dx$.\nIf $\\|f\\|_1 = 0$, then $f=0$ almost everywhere, $\\hat{f}=0$, and the function is trivially continuous.\nAssume $\\|f\\|_1 > 0$. Let $\\delta = \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\|f\\|_1}$.\n\nConsider the set $W = N(K, \\delta) \\subset \\widehat{G}$ defined by:\n$$ W = \\{ \\eta \\in \\widehat{G} : | \\chi(\\eta, x) - 1 | < \\delta \\text{ for all } x \\in K \\} $$\nBy the definition of the compact-open topology on $\\widehat{G}$, $W$ is an open neighborhood of the identity $0 \\in \\widehat{G}$.\n\nDefine $V = \\xi_0 + W = \\{ \\xi_0 + \\eta : \\eta \\in W \\}$. Since translation is a homeomorphism in a topological group, $V$ is an open neighborhood of $\\xi_0$.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the bound**\nFor any $\\xi \\in V$, we have $\\eta = \\xi - \\xi_0 \\in W$. By the definition of $W$, this implies:\n$$ \\sup_{x \\in K} |\\chi(\\xi - \\xi_0, x) - 1| < \\delta $$\nSubstituting this back into our integral estimate:\n$$ |\\hat{f}(\\xi) - \\hat{f}(\\xi_0)| \\leq \\int_{K} |f(x)| \\left| \\chi(\\xi - \\xi_0, x) - 1 \\right| \\, dx $$\n$$ < \\int_{K} |f(x)| \\cdot \\delta \\, dx $$\n$$ = \\delta \\int_{K} |f(x)| \\, dx $$\n$$ = \\delta \\|f\\|_1 $$\nSubstituting $\\delta = \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\|f\\|_1}$:\n$$ |\\hat{f}(\\xi) - \\hat{f}(\\xi_0)| < \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\|f\\|_1} \\|f\\|_1 = \\epsilon $$\n\n### Conclusion\nWe have shown that for any $\\xi_0 \\in \\widehat{G}$ and any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists an open neighborhood $V$ of $\\xi_0$ such that for all $\\xi \\in V$, $|\\hat{f}(\\xi) - \\hat{f}(\\xi_0)| < \\epsilon$.

Since $\\widehat{G}$ is a topological group, the neighborhoods of an arbitrary point $\\xi_0 \\in \\widehat{G}$ are translations of these basis sets, i.e., $\\xi_0 + N(K, \\epsilon)$.\n\n### 2. Proof of Continuity\n\nLet $f: G \\to \\mathbb{C}$ be a continuous function with compact support. We denote the support of $f$ by $K = \\text{supp}(f)$. Since $f$ is continuous and $K$ is compact, $f$ is bounded. Since $K$ is compact, $f \\in L^1(G)$.\n\nWe wish to show that $\\hat{f}$ is continuous at an arbitrary point $\\xi_0 \\in \\widehat{G}$.\n\n**Step 1: Formulate the difference**\nFix $\\xi_0 \\in \\widehat{G}$ and let $\\epsilon > 0$. We evaluate the magnitude of the difference $|\\hat{f}(\\xi) - \\hat{f}(\\xi_0)|$ for an arbitrary $\\xi \\in \\widehat{G}$:\n$$ |\\hat{f}(\\xi) - \\hat{f}(\\xi_0)| = \\left| \\int_{G} f(x) \\overline{\\chi(\\xi, x)} \\, dx - \\int_{G} f(x) \\overline{\\chi(\\xi_0, x)} \\, dx \\right| $$\nBy linearity of the integral, we combine terms:\n$$ = \\left| \\int_{G} f(x) \\left( \\overline{\\chi(\\xi, x)} - \\overline{\\chi(\\xi_0, x)} \\right) \\, dx \\right| $$\nApplying the triangle inequality for integrals:\n$$ \\leq \\int_{G} |f(x)| \\left| \\overline{\\chi(\\xi, x)} - \\overline{\\chi(\\xi_0, x)} \\right| \\, dx $$\nSince $f$ vanishes outside the compact set $K$, the domain of integration restricts to $K$:\n$$ = \\int_{K} |f(x)| \\left| \\overline{\\chi(\\xi, x)} - \\overline{\\chi(\\xi_0, x)} \\right| \\, dx $$\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the character term**\nRecall that $|\\bar{z}| = |z|$. Thus:\n$$ \\left| \\overline{\\chi(\\xi, x)} - \\overline{\\chi(\\xi_0, x)} \\right| = \\left| \\chi(\\xi, x) - \\chi(\\xi_0, x) \\right| $$\nUsing the homomorphism property $\\chi(\\xi, x) = \\chi(\\xi_0 + (\\xi - \\xi_0), x) = \\chi(\\xi_0, x)\\chi(\\xi - \\xi_0, x)$:\n$$ \\left| \\chi(\\xi, x) - \\chi(\\xi_0, x) \\right| = \\left| \\chi(\\xi_0, x) \\left( \\chi(\\xi - \\xi_0, x) - 1 \\right) \\right| $$\nSince characters map to $\\mathbb{T}$, $|\\chi(\\xi_0, x)| = 1$. Therefore:\n$$ \\left| \\chi(\\xi, x) - \\chi(\\xi_0, x) \\right| = \\left| \\chi(\\xi - \\xi_0, x) - 1 \\right| $$\nLet $\\eta = \\xi - \\xi_0$. The expression becomes:\n$$ |\\hat{f}(\\xi) - \\hat{f}(\\xi_0)| \\leq \\int_{K} |f(x)| \\left| \\chi(\\eta, x) - 1 \\right| \\, dx $$\n\n**Step 3: Construct the neighborhood**\nLet $\\|f\\|_1 = \\int_G |f(x)| \\, dx$.\nIf $\\|f\\|_1 = 0$, then $f=0$ almost everywhere, $\\hat{f}=0$, and the function is trivially continuous.\nAssume $\\|f\\|_1 > 0$. Let $\\delta = \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\|f\\|_1}$.\n\nConsider the set $W = N(K, \\delta) \\subset \\widehat{G}$ defined by:\n$$ W = \\{ \\eta \\in \\widehat{G} : | \\chi(\\eta, x) - 1 | < \\delta \\text{ for all } x \\in K \\} $$\nBy the definition of the compact-open topology on $\\widehat{G}$, $W$ is an open neighborhood of the identity $0 \\in \\widehat{G}$.\n\nDefine $V = \\xi_0 + W = \\{ \\xi_0 + \\eta : \\eta \\in W \\}$. Since translation is a homeomorphism in a topological group, $V$ is an open neighborhood of $\\xi_0$.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the bound**\nFor any $\\xi \\in V$, we have $\\eta = \\xi - \\xi_0 \\in W$. By the definition of $W$, this implies:\n$$ \\sup_{x \\in K} |\\chi(\\xi - \\xi_0, x) - 1| < \\delta $$\nSubstituting this back into our integral estimate:\n$$ |\\hat{f}(\\xi) - \\hat{f}(\\xi_0)| \\leq \\int_{K} |f(x)| \\left| \\chi(\\xi - \\xi_0, x) - 1 \\right| \\, dx $$\n$$ < \\int_{K} |f(x)| \\cdot \\delta \\, dx $$\n$$ = \\delta \\int_{K} |f(x)| \\, dx $$\n$$ = \\delta \\|f\\|_1 $$\nSubstituting $\\delta = \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\|f\\|_1}$:\n$$ |\\hat{f}(\\xi) - \\hat{f}(\\xi_0)| < \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\|f\\|_1} \\|f\\|_1 = \\epsilon $$\n\n### Conclusion\nWe have shown that for any $\\xi_0 \\in \\widehat{G}$ and any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists an open neighborhood $V$ of $\\xi_0$ such that for all $\\xi \\in V$, $|\\hat{f}(\\xi) - \\hat{f}(\\xi_0)| < \\epsilon$. Therefore, the Fourier transform $\\hat{f}$ is continuous on $\\widehat{G}$.",

By the Banach Fixed Point Theorem, the solution $f(x)$ exists, is unique, and is given by the limit of the iterative sequence (or equivalently, the summation of the series derived above).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe function $f(x)$ is given by the uniformly convergent series expansion for small $\\lambda$:\n\n$$ f(x) = 1 + \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\left( \\frac{1 - e^{-x}}{x} \\right) - \\frac{\\lambda^2}{8} \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{e^{-xy}(1 - e^{-y})}{y} \\, dy + \\mathcal{O}(\\lambda^3) $$\n\nOr, defined recursively by:\n$$ f(x) = 1 + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\lambda^n f_n(x) $$\nwhere\n$$ f_n(x) = \\int_{0}^{1} e^{-xy} C_n(y) \\, dy $$\nand $C_n(y)$ is the coefficient of $\\lambda^{n-1}$ in the expansion of $\\frac{1}{1 + \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\lambda^k f_k(y)}$.",

Mathematical Formulation\n\nLet the curve $C$ be parametrized by the position vector:\n$$ \\mathbf{r}(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t)) $$\nThe tangent vector to the curve at parameter $t$ is given by the derivative of the position vector with respect to $t$. Let us denote this velocity vector as $\\mathbf{r}'(t)$. Note that the unit tangent vector $\\mathbf{T}(t)$, if defined, is parallel to $\\mathbf{r}'(t)$. Orthogonality holds for $\\mathbf{T}(t)$ if and only if it holds for $\\mathbf{r}'(t)$.\n\n**Geometric Constraint:**\nThe curve $C$ lies on the surface of a sphere of radius $R$ centered at the origin. Geometrically, this means the distance from the origin to any point on the curve is constant and equal to $R$.\nMathematically, the magnitude of the position vector is constant:\n$$ |\\mathbf{r}(t)| = R $$\nUsing the definition of the dot product, where $|\\mathbf{a}|^2 = \\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{a}$, we can square both sides to remove the square root.

Therefore, we use the **$Z$-test**.\n\n### 2. The Test Statistic\n\nThe test statistic $Z$ follows the standard normal distribution $N(0,1)$ under the null hypothesis.

Determining the Standardized Critical Values ($Z$-scores)\n\nThe alternative hypothesis is two-tailed ($H_1: \\mu \\neq 20$). Consequently, the significance level $\\alpha = 0.05$ is split equally between the two tails of the normal distribution:\n$$ \\text{Area in each tail} = \\frac{\\alpha}{2} = \\frac{0.05}{2} = 0.025 $$\n\nWe need to find the critical $Z$-value ($z_{\\text{crit}}$) such that the probability to the right of $z_{\\text{crit}}$ is $0.025$ and the probability to the left of $-z_{\\text{crit}}$ is $0.025$.\n\nUsing the standard normal distribution table:\n- We look for the $Z$-score that corresponds to a cumulative probability of $1 - 0.025 = 0.975$.\n- The table indicates that $P(Z \\le 1.96) = 0.975$.\n\nThus, the standardized critical values are:\n$$ Z_{\\text{critical}} = \\pm 1.96 $$\n\n### 4. Determining the Critical Values for the Sample Mean ($\\bar{X}$)\n\nWhile the $Z$-scores define the critical region in standard units, the critical values for the specific sample mean $\\bar{X}$ provide the decision boundaries in the original units of the data.\n\nWe define the critical boundaries $\\bar{X}_{\\text{crit}}$ by solving for $\\bar{X}$ in the $Z$-score formula:\n$$ \\pm 1.96 = \\frac{\\bar{X}_{\\text{crit}} - 20}{0.5} $$\n\nSolving for the **upper critical value**:\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\bar{X}_{\\text{upper}} - 20}{0.5} &= 1.96 \\\\ \\bar{X}_{\\text{upper}} - 20 &= 1.96(0.5) \\\\ \\bar{X}_{\\text{upper}} &= 20 + 0.98 \\\\ \\bar{X}_{\\text{upper}} &= 20.98 \\end{aligned} $$\n\nSolving for the **lower critical value**:\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\bar{X}_{\\text{lower}} - 20}{0.5} &= -1.96 \\\\ \\bar{X}_{\\text{lower}} - 20 &= -1.96(0.5) \\\\ \\bar{X}_{\\text{lower}} &= 20 - 0.98 \\\\ \\bar{X}_{\\text{lower}} &= 19.02 \\end{aligned} $$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe critical values for the hypothesis test can be stated in terms of the test statistic ($Z$) or the sample mean ($\\bar{X}$):\n\n1.  **Standardized Critical Values:** $\\mathbf{\\pm 1.96}$\n2.  **Critical Values for the Sample Mean:** $\\mathbf{19.02}$ and $\\mathbf{20.98}$\n\nThe null hypothesis $H_0$ will be rejected if the calculated sample mean $\\bar{X}$ is less than $19.02$ or greater than $20.98$.",

It is calculated as:\n$$Z = \\frac{\\bar{X} - \\mu_0}{\\sigma_{\\bar{X}}}$$\nwhere:\n- $\\mu_0 = 20$ is the hypothesized population mean.\n- $\\sigma_{\\bar{X}}$ is the standard error of the mean.\n\nFirst, we calculate the standard error:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\bar{X}} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} = \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{100}} = \\frac{5}{10} = 0.5 $$\n\n### 3. Determining the Standardized Critical Values ($Z$-scores)\n\nThe alternative hypothesis is two-tailed ($H_1: \\mu \\neq 20$). Consequently, the significance level $\\alpha = 0.05$ is split equally between the two tails of the normal distribution:\n$$ \\text{Area in each tail} = \\frac{\\alpha}{2} = \\frac{0.05}{2} = 0.025 $$\n\nWe need to find the critical $Z$-value ($z_{\\text{crit}}$) such that the probability to the right of $z_{\\text{crit}}$ is $0.025$ and the probability to the left of $-z_{\\text{crit}}$ is $0.025$.\n\nUsing the standard normal distribution table:\n- We look for the $Z$-score that corresponds to a cumulative probability of $1 - 0.025 = 0.975$.\n- The table indicates that $P(Z \\le 1.96) = 0.975$.\n\nThus, the standardized critical values are:\n$$ Z_{\\text{critical}} = \\pm 1.96 $$\n\n### 4. Determining the Critical Values for the Sample Mean ($\\bar{X}$)\n\nWhile the $Z$-scores define the critical region in standard units, the critical values for the specific sample mean $\\bar{X}$ provide the decision boundaries in the original units of the data.\n\nWe define the critical boundaries $\\bar{X}_{\\text{crit}}$ by solving for $\\bar{X}$ in the $Z$-score formula:\n$$ \\pm 1.96 = \\frac{\\bar{X}_{\\text{crit}} - 20}{0.5} $$\n\nSolving for the **upper critical value**:\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\bar{X}_{\\text{upper}} - 20}{0.5} &= 1.96 \\\\ \\bar{X}_{\\text{upper}} - 20 &= 1.96(0.5) \\\\ \\bar{X}_{\\text{upper}} &= 20 + 0.98 \\\\ \\bar{X}_{\\text{upper}} &= 20.98 \\end{aligned} $$\n\nSolving for the **lower critical value**:\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\bar{X}_{\\text{lower}} - 20}{0.5} &= -1.96 \\\\ \\bar{X}_{\\text{lower}} - 20 &= -1.96(0.5) \\\\ \\bar{X}_{\\text{lower}} &= 20 - 0.98 \\\\ \\bar{X}_{\\text{lower}} &= 19.02 \\end{aligned} $$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe critical values for the hypothesis test can be stated in terms of the test statistic ($Z$) or the sample mean ($\\bar{X}$):\n\n1.  **Standardized Critical Values:** $\\mathbf{\\pm 1.96}$\n2.  **Critical Values for the Sample Mean:** $\\mathbf{19.02}$ and $\\mathbf{20.98}$\n\nThe null hypothesis $H_0$ will be rejected if the calculated sample mean $\\bar{X}$ is less than $19.02$ or greater than $20.98$.",

In a UFD like $\\mathbb{Z}[x]$, an element is prime if and only if it is irreducible.\n\n*   **For $x - 2$**: This polynomial is linear and primitive (the greatest common divisor of its coefficients is 1). Therefore, it is irreducible in $\\mathbb{Z}[x]$. Consequently, the ideal $P_1 = \\langle x - 2 \\rangle$ is a prime ideal.\n    *   *Verification*: $R/P_1 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}[x]/\\langle x-2 \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. Since $\\mathbb{Z}$ is an integral domain, $P_1$ is prime.\n\n*   **For $x + 2$**: Similarly, $x + 2$ is linear and primitive, making it irreducible. Thus, the ideal $P_2 = \\langle x + 2 \\rangle$ is a prime ideal.\n    *   *Verification*: $R/P_2 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}[x]/\\langle x+2 \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. Since $\\mathbb{Z}$ is an integral domain, $P_2$ is prime.\n\n### 3. Property of the Radical\n\nThe radical of an ideal $I$, denoted $\\sqrt{I}$, equals the intersection of all prime ideals in $R$ that contain $I$.\n$$ \\sqrt{I} = \\bigcap_{P \\supseteq I} P $$\nSince $I = \\langle (x-2)(x+2) \\rangle$, any prime ideal $P$ containing $I$ must contain the product $(x-2)(x+2)$. By the definition of a prime ideal, if $ab \\in P$, then $a \\in P$ or $b \\in P$. Therefore, any prime ideal containing $I$ must contain either $x-2$ (and thus $P_1$) or $x+2$ (and thus $P_2$).\n\nThe intersection of all such prime ideals is exactly the intersection of the minimal prime ideals containing $I$. The minimal primes over $I$ are $P_1$ and $P_2$. Thus:\n$$ \\sqrt{I} = P_1 \\cap P_2 = \\langle x - 2 \\rangle \\cap \\langle x + 2 \\rangle $$\n\n### 4.

Any common divisor $d(x)$ must divide their difference:\n$$ (x+2) - (x-2) = 4 $$\nThe divisors of 4 in $\\mathbb{Z}[x]$ are the integer units $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4$ (and their associates). However, $x-2$ is primitive (content is 1), so no integer other than $\\pm 1$ divides $x-2$. Thus, $\\text{gcd}(x-2, x+2) = 1$.\n\nSince the polynomials are coprime, their LCM is their product:\n$$ \\text{lcm}(x-2, x+2) = (x-2)(x+2) = x^2 - 4 $$\nTherefore, the intersection is:\n$$ P_1 \\cap P_2 = \\langle x^2 - 4 \\rangle = I $$\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nSince $\\sqrt{I} = P_1 \\cap P_2$ and $P_1 \\cap P_2 = I$, we conclude that $I$ is a radical ideal (it is its own radical).\n\nThe radical of the ideal $I = \\langle x^2 - 4 \\rangle$ in $R = \\mathbb{Z}[x]$ is:\n$$ \\sqrt{\\langle x^2 - 4 \\rangle} = \\langle x^2 - 4 \\rangle $$",
