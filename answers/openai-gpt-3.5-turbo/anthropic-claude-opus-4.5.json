This list contains ALL prime numbers.\n\n**Step 3: Construct a new number**\n\nConsider the number:\n$$N = p_1 \\cdot p_2 \\cdot p_3 \\cdots p_n + 1 = \\left(\\prod_{i=1}^{n} p_i\\right) + 1$$\n\nNote that $N > 1$ since each $p_i \\geq 2$.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the nature of N**\n\nSince $N > 1$, exactly one of two cases must hold:\n\n---\n\n**Case A: $N$ is prime**\n\nIf $N$ is prime, then $N$ is a prime number not in our list $\\{p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n\\}$ because:\n$$N = \\left(\\prod_{i=1}^{n} p_i\\right) + 1 > p_i \\quad \\text{for all } i$$\n\nThis contradicts our assumption that the list contains **all** primes. \u2717\n\n---\n\n**Case B: $N$ is composite**\n\nIf $N$ is composite, by the **Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic**, $N$ must have at least one prime divisor. Let $q$ be a prime such that $q \\mid N$.\n\nSince our list contains all primes, we must have $q = p_j$ for some $j \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}$.\n\nNow observe:\n- $p_j \\mid N$ (by assumption)\n- $p_j \\mid (p_1 \\cdot p_2 \\cdots p_n)$ (since $p_j$ is a factor in the product)\n\nTherefore:\n$$p_j \\mid \\left[N - (p_1 \\cdot p_2 \\cdots p_n)\\right] = 1$$\n\nBut $p_j \\geq 2$, so $p_j \\nmid 1$. This is a **contradiction**. \u2717\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\n\nBoth cases lead to contradictions. Therefore, our initial assumption must be false.\n\n$$\\boxed{\\text{There are infinitely many prime numbers.}}$$\n\n---\n\n## Remark\nThis proof, attributed to **Euclid** (~300 BCE), remains one of the most elegant proofs in mathematics. The key insight is that $N$ leaves remainder 1 when divided by any prime in our supposed complete list.",

This makes the 10\u00d710 grid a single connected component.\n\n**Property 2: The grid graph is bipartite**\n\nI can partition all cells into two sets based on their coordinates $(i, j)$ where $i$ is the row and $j$ is the column:\n- **Set A**: cells where $i + j$ is even\n- **Set B**: cells where $i + j$ is odd\n\nAny two adjacent cells differ by 1 in exactly one coordinate, so their $(i+j)$ values have opposite parity. This means **edges only connect cells from Set A to Set B**, confirming the graph is bipartite.\n\n## Counting the Colorings\n\nFor a **connected bipartite graph** with the standard two-part partition $(A, B)$:\n\n**Theorem**: A connected graph has exactly 2 proper 2-colorings if and only if it is bipartite (and 0 otherwise).\n\n**Proof for our case:**\n1. Choose any starting cell, say the top-left corner $(1,1)$\n2. Assign it a color (say black)\n3. All its neighbors **must** be white (by the adjacency constraint)\n4. All neighbors of those neighbors **must** be black\n5. Continue this process...\n\nSince the graph is connected, the color of the starting cell **completely determines** the colors of all other cells. There are only 2 choices for the starting cell's color.\n\n## The Two Valid Colorings\n\nThe two valid colorings are exactly the **checkerboard patterns**:\n\n1. **Pattern 1**: Cell $(i,j)$ is black if $i+j$ is even, white if $i+j$ is odd\n2. **Pattern 2**: Cell $(i,j)$ is white if $i+j$ is even, black if $i+j$ is odd\n\nThese are the only configurations where no two adjacent cells share the same color.\n\n## Final Answer\n\n$$\\boxed{2}$$",

We need to show that $24 \\mid p^2 - 1$.\n\nFirst, I'll factor the expression:\n$$p^2 - 1 = (p-1)(p+1)$$\n\nSince $24 = 8 \\times 3$ and $\\gcd(8,3) = 1$, it suffices to prove:\n1. $8 \\mid (p-1)(p+1)$\n2. $3 \\mid (p-1)(p+1)$\n\n---\n\n## Part 1: Divisibility by 3\n\nSince $p > 3$ is prime, $p$ is **not divisible by 3**. Thus $p \\equiv 1$ or $p \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$.\n\n- If $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$: then $p - 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, so $3 \\mid (p-1)$\n- If $p \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$: then $p + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, so $3 \\mid (p+1)$\n\n**Conclusion:** $3 \\mid (p-1)(p+1)$ \u2713\n\n---\n\n## Part 2: Divisibility by 8\n\nSince $p > 3$ is prime, $p$ must be **odd** (as 2 is the only even prime).\n\nTherefore, both $p-1$ and $p+1$ are **even consecutive even numbers**.\n\nWrite $p - 1 = 2k$ for some integer $k$. Then $p + 1 = 2(k+1)$.\n\n**Key observation:** Among any two consecutive integers $k$ and $k+1$, exactly one is even.\n\nThis means:\n- One of $\\{p-1, p+1\\}$ equals $2 \\times (\\text{odd}) \\Rightarrow$ divisible by exactly 2\n- The other equals $2 \\times (\\text{even}) \\Rightarrow$ divisible by at least 4\n\nTherefore:\n$$(p-1)(p+1) \\text{ is divisible by } 2 \\times 4 = 8$$\n\n**Conclusion:** $8 \\mid (p-1)(p+1)$ \u2713\n\n---\n\n## Final Conclusion\n\nSince $\\gcd(3, 8) = 1$, and both $3$ and $8$ divide $(p-1)(p+1)$:\n\n$$\\boxed{24 \\mid p^2 - 1}$$\n\n---\n\n## Verification with Examples\n\n| $p$ | $p^2 - 1$ | $\\frac{p^2-1}{24}$ |\n|-----|-----------|-------------------|\n| 5   | 24        | 1                 |\n| 7   | 48        | 2                 |\n| 11  | 120       | 5                 |\n| 13  | 168       | 7                 |",
