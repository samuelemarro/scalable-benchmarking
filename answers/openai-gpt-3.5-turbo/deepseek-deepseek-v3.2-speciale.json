A proper 2\u2011coloring requires adjacent cells to have different colors.\n\nFor a connected bipartite graph with at least one edge, the color of one vertex determines the colors of all others. Because the graph contains only even cycles, the constraints are consistent.

        "answer": "We need to prove that for any prime $p > 3$, the number $p^2 - 1$ is divisible by 24.\n\n**Proof.**  \nLet $p$ be a prime number with $p > 3$. Then $p$ is odd and not divisible by 3.  \nConsider the factorization  \n$$\np^2 - 1 = (p-1)(p+1).\n$$\n\n**Divisibility by 3.**  \nAmong three consecutive integers $p-1$, $p$, $p+1$, exactly one is divisible by 3. Since $p > 3$ is prime, $p$ is not divisible by 3. Hence either $p-1$ or $p+1$ is divisible by 3. Therefore $(p-1)(p+1)$ is divisible by 3.\n\n**Divisibility by 8.**  \nBecause $p$ is odd, $p-1$ and $p+1$ are two consecutive even numbers. One of them is divisible by 4 (since every other even number is a multiple of 4). Thus their product is divisible by $2 \\cdot 4 = 8$. More formally, write $p = 2k+1$ with $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Then  \n$$\n(p-1)(p+1) = (2k)(2k+2) = 4k(k+1).\n$$  \nSince $k(k+1)$ is always even (the product of two consecutive integers), $4k(k+1)$ is divisible by $8$.\n\n**Conclusion.**  \nWe have shown that $p^2-1$ is divisible by both 3 and 8. Because $\\gcd(3,8)=1$, it follows that $p^2-1$ is divisible by $3 \\times 8 = 24$.  \n\nThus for every prime $p > 3$, $24 \\mid (p^2 - 1)$. $\\square$\n\n**Note.** The condition $p > 3$ is necessary: for $p=2$, $p^2-1=3$ (not divisible by 24); for $p=3$, $p^2-1=8$ (not divisible by 24).",
