        "answer": "To prove that there are infinitely many prime numbers using a proof by contradiction, we start by assuming the opposite of what we want to prove. \n\n**Assumption (for contradiction):** Suppose there are only finitely many prime numbers. Let's denote these primes as $p_1, p_2, p_3, \\ldots, p_n$.\n\n**Construct a New Number:**\nConsider the number $N$ defined as follows:\n$$\nN = p_1 \\times p_2 \\times p_3 \\times \\cdots \\times p_n + 1\n$$\nThis number $N$ is constructed by multiplying all the assumed finite primes together and then adding 1.\n\n**Analysis of $N$:**\nBy construction, $N$ is greater than 1. Now, let's consider the divisibility of $N$ by any of the primes $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$.\n\n- If we divide $N$ by any prime $p_i$ (where $i$ ranges from 1 to $n$), we have:\n  $$\n  N \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p_i}\n  $$\n  This is because:\n  $$\n  N = p_1 \\times p_2 \\times \\cdots \\times p_n + 1 \\equiv 0 + 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p_i}\n  $$\n  Therefore, $N$ is not divisible by any of the primes $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSince $N$ is not divisible by any of the primes in our finite list, $N$ must either be a prime itself or have a prime factor that is not in our list. In either case, this contradicts our original assumption that $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$ were all the primes that exist.\n\nThus, our assumption that there are only finitely many primes must be false. Therefore, there must be infinitely many prime numbers.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThere are infinitely many prime numbers.",

        "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to color a 10x10 grid such that no two adjacent cells share the same color. This is a classic problem of coloring a grid with two colors, often referred to as a checkerboard coloring problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We have a 10x10 grid.\n   - Each cell can be either black or white.\n   - No two adjacent cells (sharing a side) can have the same color.\n\n2. **Checkerboard Pattern:**\n   - The condition that no two adjacent cells share the same color suggests a checkerboard pattern.\n   - In a checkerboard pattern, cells are colored alternately. For example, if the top-left cell is black, then the cell to its right is white, the cell below it is white, and so on.\n\n3. **Coloring the Grid:**\n   - Choose a color for the top-left cell. Let's say we choose black.\n   - The cell to the right of it must be white, the cell below it must be white, and so on.\n   - This pattern continues such that all cells in the same row or column alternate colors.\n\n4. **Counting the Patterns:**\n   - There are two possible checkerboard patterns:\n     1. Start with the top-left cell as black.\n     2. Start with the top-left cell as white.\n   - Once the color of the top-left cell is chosen, the rest of the grid's coloring is completely determined.\n\n5. **Final Calculation:**\n   - Since there are only two valid ways to color the grid (starting with black or starting with white), the total number of ways to color the grid is 2.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe number of ways to color the 10x10 grid such that no two adjacent cells share the same color is $\\boxed{2}$.",

        "answer": "To prove that $p^2 - 1$ is divisible by 24 for any prime number $p > 3$, we need to show that $p^2 - 1$ is divisible by 2, 3, and 4, since $24 = 2^3 \\times 3$.\n\n### Step 1: Divisibility by 2\n\nFor any prime $p > 3$, $p$ must be odd. Therefore, $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$ or $p \\equiv -1 \\pmod{2}$. In either case, $p^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$. Thus:\n\n$$\np^2 - 1 \\equiv 1 - 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}\n$$\n\nThis shows that $p^2 - 1$ is divisible by 2.\n\n### Step 2: Divisibility by 3\n\nFor any prime $p > 3$, $p$ is not divisible by 3. Therefore, $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$ or $p \\equiv -1 \\pmod{3}$. In either case, $p^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$. Thus:\n\n$$\np^2 - 1 \\equiv 1 - 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}\n$$\n\nThis shows that $p^2 - 1$ is divisible by 3.\n\n### Step 3: Divisibility by 4\n\nFor any prime $p > 3$, $p$ is odd, so $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$ or $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$. Let's consider both cases:\n\n- If $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, then $p^2 \\equiv 1^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$.\n- If $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$, then $p^2 \\equiv 3^2 \\equiv 9 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$.\n\nIn both cases, $p^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$. Thus:\n\n$$\np^2 - 1 \\equiv 1 - 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}\n$$\n\nThis shows that $p^2 - 1$ is divisible by 4.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince $p^2 - 1$ is divisible by 2, 3, and 4, it is divisible by their least common multiple, which is 24. Therefore, for any prime $p > 3$, $p^2 - 1$ is divisible by 24.\n\n$$\n\\boxed{p^2 - 1 \\text{ is divisible by 24 for any prime } p > 3.}\n$$",
