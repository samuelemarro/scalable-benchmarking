        "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to find a closed-form expression for the sequence defined by the recurrence relation:\n\n$$\na_{n+2} = \\frac{5a_{n+1} - 6a_{n}}{3a_{n+1} - 4a_{n}}\n$$\n\nwith initial conditions $a_0 = 2$ and $a_1 = 3$.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Recurrence Relation\n\nThe recurrence relation is:\n\n$$\na_{n+2} = \\frac{5a_{n+1} - 6a_{n}}{3a_{n+1} - 4a_{n}}\n$$\n\nThis is a non-linear recurrence relation, which makes it challenging to solve directly. However, we can try to compute the first few terms to identify any patterns.\n\n### Step 2: Compute the First Few Terms\n\nUsing the initial conditions:\n\n- $a_0 = 2$\n- $a_1 = 3$\n\nCompute $a_2$:\n\n$$\na_2 = \\frac{5 \\cdot 3 - 6 \\cdot 2}{3 \\cdot 3 - 4 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{15 - 12}{9 - 8} = \\frac{3}{1} = 3\n$$\n\nCompute $a_3$:\n\n$$\na_3 = \\frac{5 \\cdot 3 - 6 \\cdot 3}{3 \\cdot 3 - 4 \\cdot 3} = \\frac{15 - 18}{9 - 12} = \\frac{-3}{-3} = 1\n$$\n\nCompute $a_4$:\n\n$$\na_4 = \\frac{5 \\cdot 1 - 6 \\cdot 3}{3 \\cdot 1 - 4 \\cdot 3} = \\frac{5 - 18}{3 - 12} = \\frac{-13}{-9} = \\frac{13}{9}\n$$\n\nCompute $a_5$:\n\n$$\na_5 = \\frac{5 \\cdot \\frac{13}{9} - 6 \\cdot 1}{3 \\cdot \\frac{13}{9} - 4 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{\\frac{65}{9} - 6}{\\frac{39}{9} - 4} = \\frac{\\frac{65}{9} - \\frac{54}{9}}{\\frac{39}{9} - \\frac{36}{9}} = \\frac{\\frac{11}{9}}{\\frac{3}{9}} = \\frac{11}{3}\n$$\n\n### Step 3: Identify a Pattern\n\nThe terms computed are:\n\n- $a_0 = 2$\n- $a_1 = 3$\n- $a_2 = 3$\n- $a_3 = 1$\n- $a_4 = \\frac{13}{9}$\n- $a_5 = \\frac{11}{3}$\n\nThe sequence does not immediately suggest a simple pattern. However, let's try to find a simpler form by considering the possibility of a constant sequence or a simple arithmetic or geometric sequence.\n\n### Step 4: Check for Constant Sequence\n\nNotice that $a_1 = a_2 = 3$. If the sequence were constant, then $a_n = 3$ for all $n \\geq 1$.\n\nCheck if this holds for the recurrence relation:\n\nAssume $a_n = 3$ for all $n \\geq 1$. Then:\n\n$$\na_{n+2} = \\frac{5 \\cdot 3 - 6 \\cdot 3}{3 \\cdot 3 - 4 \\cdot 3} = \\frac{15 - 18}{9 - 12} = \\frac{-3}{-3} = 1\n$$\n\nThis does not hold, so the sequence is not constant.\n\n### Step 5: Re-evaluate the Sequence\n\nGiven the complexity and the non-linear nature of the recurrence, and the fact that the sequence does not appear to follow a simple arithmetic or geometric pattern, it is likely that the sequence does not have a simple closed-form expression.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe sequence defined by the given recurrence relation does not appear to have a simple closed-form expression based on the initial terms and the complexity of the recurrence. Further analysis or a different approach might be needed to find a more explicit form, but based on the calculations and pattern recognition, a simple closed-form expression is not evident."

        "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to find the side length $s$ of the square $ABCD$ given that $BM = 1$, where $M$ is the midpoint of $EF$ in the equilateral triangle $AEF$ constructed inside the square.\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n1. **Positioning the Square and Triangle:**\n   - Place the square $ABCD$ in the coordinate plane with $B = (0, 0)$, $C = (s, 0)$, $D = (s, s)$, and $A$ on segment $BC$. Let $A = (x, 0)$ where $0 \\leq x \\leq s$.\n\n2. **Constructing the Equilateral Triangle:**\n   - Since $AEF$ is equilateral, the points $E$ and $F$ must be positioned such that $AE = EF = FA$.\n   - Assume $E = (x + \\frac{s}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}s)$ and $F = (x - \\frac{s}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}s)$. This configuration ensures $AE = EF = FA = s$.\n\n3. **Finding the Midpoint $M$:**\n   - The midpoint $M$ of $EF$ is calculated as:\n     $$\n     M = \\left( \\frac{(x + \\frac{s}{2}) + (x - \\frac{s}{2})}{2}, \\frac{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}s + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}s}{2} \\right) = (x, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}s)\n     $$\n\n4. **Condition $BM = 1$:**\n   - The distance $BM$ is given by:\n     $$\n     BM = \\sqrt{(x - 0)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}s - 0\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{x^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}s\\right)^2}\n     $$\n   - Set $BM = 1$:\n     $$\n     \\sqrt{x^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}s\\right)^2} = 1\n     $$\n   - Square both sides:\n     $$\n     x^2 + \\frac{3}{4}s^2 = 1\n     $$\n\n5. **Solving for $s$:**\n   - Since $A$ is on $BC$, $0 \\leq x \\leq s$. We need another equation to solve for $s$.\n   - Use the fact that $AE = s$:\n     $$\n     \\sqrt{\\left(x + \\frac{s}{2} - x\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}s\\right)^2} = s\n     $$\n     $$\n     \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{s}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}s\\right)^2} = s\n     $$\n     $$\n     \\sqrt{\\frac{s^2}{4} + \\frac{3s^2}{4}} = s\n     $$\n     $$\n     \\sqrt{s^2} = s\n     $$\n   - This confirms $AE = s$.\n\n6. **Substitute and Solve:**\n   - From $x^2 + \\frac{3}{4}s^2 = 1$, substitute $x = 0$ (since $A$ is on $BC$ and $BM = 1$):\n     $$\n     0^2 + \\frac{3}{4}s^2 = 1\n     $$\n     $$\n     \\frac{3}{4}s^2 = 1\n     $$\n     $$\n     s^2 = \\frac{4}{3}\n     $$\n     $$\n     s = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}\n     $$\n\nThus, the side length $s$ of the square is $\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}$."

If $\\angle APB = 120^\\circ$, $\\angle BPC = 100^\\circ$, and $\\angle CPA = 140^\\circ$, determine the ratio $r/s$, where $s$ is the side length of the equilateral triangle.",
        "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the ratio $r/s$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle and $s$ is the side length of the inscribed equilateral triangle $\\triangle ABC$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Geometry\nThe circle is centered at $O$ with radius $r$, and the equilateral triangle $\\triangle ABC$ is inscribed in this circle. This means that the vertices $A$, $B$, and $C$ lie on the circle, and the center $O$ is also the circumcenter of the triangle.\n\n### Step 2: Use the Given Angles\nWe are given that:\n- $\\angle APB = 120^\\circ$\n- $\\angle BPC = 100^\\circ$\n- $\\angle CPA = 140^\\circ$\n\nThese angles are the angles subtended by the arcs $\\overset{\\frown}{AB}$, $\\overset{\\frown}{BC}$, and $\\overset{\\frown}{CA}$ at point $P$.\n\n### Step 3: Relate the Angles to the Arcs\nThe sum of the angles around point $P$ is $360^\\circ$, which is consistent with the given angles:\n$$\n\\angle APB + \\angle BPC + \\angle CPA = 120^\\circ + 100^\\circ + 140^\\circ = 360^\\circ\n$$\n\n### Step 4: Use the Inscribed Angle Theorem\nThe inscribed angle theorem states that an angle subtended by an arc at the circumference is half the angle subtended by the same arc at the center. Therefore, the central angles corresponding to these arcs are:\n- $\\angle AOB = 2 \\times 120^\\circ = 240^\\circ$\n- $\\angle BOC = 2 \\times 100^\\circ = 200^\\circ$\n- $\\angle COA = 2 \\times 140^\\circ = 280^\\circ$\n\n### Step 5: Check the Sum of Central Angles\nThe sum of the central angles should be $360^\\circ$, but we have:\n$$\n\\angle AOB + \\angle BOC + \\angle COA = 240^\\circ + 200^\\circ + 280^\\circ = 720^\\circ\n$$\nThis is incorrect, indicating a misunderstanding. Let's reconsider the problem.\n\n### Step 6: Correct Understanding\nThe angles $\\angle APB$, $\\angle BPC$, and $\\angle CPA$ are not directly related to the central angles. Instead, they are angles at point $P$ on the circle. The key is to recognize that the sum of these angles is $360^\\circ$, which is consistent.\n\n### Step 7: Use the Property of Equilateral Triangle\nIn an equilateral triangle inscribed in a circle, the side length $s$ is related to the radius $r$ by the formula:\n$$\ns = r \\sqrt{3}\n$$\nThis is derived from the fact that the circumradius $R$ of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is given by:\n$$\nR = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}}\n$$\nSince the circle is the circumcircle of the triangle, $r = R$.\n\n### Conclusion\nThus, the ratio $r/s$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{r}{s} = \\frac{r}{r\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\n$$\n\nTherefore, the ratio $r/s$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}}$."

        "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the condition $f(x) = f'(x)$ for a polynomial $f(x)$ of degree 5. Since this equality holds for infinitely many real values of $x$, it implies that the polynomial $f(x) - f'(x)$ is identically zero. Therefore, we have:\n\n$$\nf(x) = f'(x)\n$$\n\nThis implies that the polynomial $f(x)$ satisfies the differential equation:\n\n$$\nf'(x) = f(x)\n$$\n\nThe general solution to this differential equation is:\n\n$$\nf(x) = Ce^x\n$$\n\nwhere $C$ is a constant. However, since $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 5, it cannot be expressed as $Ce^x$ unless $C = 0$, which would make $f(x)$ the zero polynomial, contradicting the given $f(0) = 1$.\n\nInstead, we consider the polynomial form. The only polynomial solutions to $f'(x) = f(x)$ are of the form:\n\n$$\nf(x) = Ae^x\n$$\n\nBut since $f(x)$ is a polynomial, the only possibility is that $f(x) = 0$, which is not the case here. Therefore, we need to find a polynomial form that satisfies the condition $f(x) = f'(x)$ for infinitely many $x$.\n\nThe polynomial $f(x)$ must be of the form:\n\n$$\nf(x) = c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 x^2 + c_3 x^3 + c_4 x^4 + c_5 x^5\n$$\n\nDifferentiating, we have:\n\n$$\nf'(x) = c_1 + 2c_2 x + 3c_3 x^2 + 4c_4 x^3 + 5c_5 x^4\n$$\n\nSetting $f(x) = f'(x)$, we equate coefficients:\n\n- $c_0 = 0$\n- $c_1 = c_1$\n- $c_2 = 2c_2$ implies $c_2 = 0$\n- $c_3 = 3c_3$ implies $c_3 = 0$\n- $c_4 = 4c_4$ implies $c_4 = 0$\n- $c_5 = 5c_5$ implies $c_5 = 0$\n\nThus, the only non-zero coefficient is $c_1$, and $f(x) = c_1 x$.

We need to show $x_{n+1} = 2(n+1)$.\n\nUsing the recurrence relation:\n\n$$\nx_{n+1} = (1 + x_n)\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{x_n}\\right) = (1 + 2n)\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2n}\\right)\n$$\n\n$$\nx_{n+1} = (1 + 2n)\\left(\\frac{2n + 1}{2n}\\right) = \\frac{(1 + 2n)(2n + 1)}{2n}\n$$\n\n$$\nx_{n+1} = \\frac{2n^2 + 3n + 1}{2n} = 2n + \\frac{3n + 1}{2n}\n$$\n\nSince $x_n = 2n$, the term $\\frac{3n + 1}{2n}$ simplifies to 1, because:\n\n$$\n\\frac{3n + 1}{2n} = \\frac{3n}{2n} + \\frac{1}{2n} = \\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{1}{2n}\n$$\n\nThis simplifies to 1 when $n$ is a positive integer, confirming:\n\n$$\nx_{n+1} = 2n + 1 = 2(n+1)\n$$\n\nThus, by induction, $x_n = 2n$ for all positive integers $n$, and $x_n$ is an integer.\n\nTherefore, the sequence $x_n$ is an integer for every positive integer $n$."

        "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the product $abcde$ given the constraints:\n\n$$\na + b + c + d + e = 10\n$$\n\n$$\nab + ac + ad + ae + bc + bd + be + cd + ce + de = 30\n$$\n\nWe can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or symmetry arguments, but a more straightforward approach is to consider the symmetry and apply the AM-GM inequality.\n\n### Step 1: Symmetry and Equal Values\n\nGiven the symmetry in the problem, a natural approach is to consider the case where $a = b = c = d = e$. Let $a = b = c = d = e = x$. Then:\n\n$$\n5x = 10 \\implies x = 2\n$$\n\nSubstituting $x = 2$ into the second equation:\n\n$$\n\\binom{5}{2} x^2 = 10x^2 = 30 \\implies x^2 = 3 \\implies x = \\sqrt{3}\n$$\n\nThis is inconsistent with $x = 2$, so not all variables can be equal. We need to explore other configurations.\n\n### Step 2: Applying AM-GM Inequality\n\nThe AM-GM inequality states that for non-negative numbers, the arithmetic mean is at least the geometric mean:\n\n$$\n\\frac{a + b + c + d + e}{5} \\geq \\sqrt[5]{abcde}\n$$\n\nGiven $a + b + c + d + e = 10$, we have:\n\n$$\n2 \\geq \\sqrt[5]{abcde} \\implies abcde \\leq 32\n$$\n\n### Step 3: Exploring Specific Configurations\n\nTo achieve the maximum, we need to check if the equality case of AM-GM can be approached. Consider a configuration where four of the variables are equal, and the fifth is different. Let $a = b = c = d = x$ and $e = y$. Then:\n\n$$\n4x + y = 10 \\implies y = 10 - 4x\n$$\n\nSubstitute into the second equation:\n\n$$\n6x^2 + 4x(10 - 4x) = 30\n$$\n\nSimplifying:\n\n$$\n6x^2 + 40x - 16x^2 = 30 \\implies -10x^2 + 40x = 30\n$$\n\n$$\n10x^2 - 40x + 30 = 0 \\implies x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0\n$$\n\nSolving this quadratic equation:\n\n$$\n(x - 3)(x - 1) = 0 \\implies x = 3 \\text{ or } x = 1\n$$\n\n- If $x = 3$, then $y = 10 - 4 \\times 3 = -2$, which is not possible.\n- If $x = 1$, then $y = 10 - 4 \\times 1 = 6$.\n\nThus, one possible configuration is $a = b = c = d = 1$ and $e = 6$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Product\n\nFor $a = b = c = d = 1$ and $e = 6$:\n\n$$\nabcde = 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 6 = 6\n$$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe maximum possible value of $abcde$ given the constraints is $\\boxed{6}$."

        "answer": "To determine whether every polynomial $P(x)$ of degree $n$ has a pivot point, we need to analyze the conditions under which a real number $r$ can satisfy $P(r) = P'(r) = P''(r) = \\ldots = P^{(j-i)}(r) = 0$ for some distinct integers $i, j$ with $i < j$.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Definitions and Initial Observations:**\n   - A pivot point $r$ is a real number where the polynomial and several of its derivatives up to a certain order vanish.\n   - The polynomial $P(x)$ is of degree $n$, so its $n$-th derivative $P^{(n)}(x)$ is a non-zero constant (specifically, $n! a_n$).\n   - If $P(r) = 0$, then $r$ is a root of the polynomial.\n   - If $P'(r) = 0$, then $r$ is a critical point of the polynomial.\n\n2. **Conditions for a Pivot Point:**\n   - For $r$ to be a pivot point, there must exist $i < j$ such that $P^{(i)}(r) = P^{(i+1)}(r) = \\ldots = P^{(j)}(r) = 0$.\n   - This implies that $r$ is a root of the polynomial and several of its derivatives.\n\n3. **Counterexample:**\n   - Consider the polynomial $P(x) = x^n + 1$.\n   - The roots of $P(x) = 0$ are the $n$-th roots of $-1$, which are complex if $n$ is even and include real roots if $n$ is odd.\n   - For $n$ even, there are no real roots, so no real number $r$ can satisfy $P(r) = 0$.\n   - For $n$ odd, the real root $r$ satisfies $P(r) = 0$, but $P'(r) \\neq 0$ because the derivative $P'(x) = nx^{n-1}$ does not vanish at the real root unless $r = 0$, which is not a root of $P(x) = x^n + 1$.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The polynomial $P(x) = x^n + 1$ for even $n$ provides a counterexample where no real number $r$ can be a pivot point because there are no real roots.\n   - Therefore, it is not true that every polynomial $P(x)$ of degree $n$ has a pivot point.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe statement is false. Not every polynomial $P(x)$ of degree $n$ has a pivot point. For example, the polynomial $P(x) = x^n + 1$ for even $n$ has no real pivot points."

        "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to show that if the set $S$ contains at least one perfect square, then it contains infinitely many perfect squares. The set $S$ is defined as the set of positive integers that can be expressed in the form $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - abc$, where $a, b, c$ are positive integers.\n\n### Step 1: Identify a Perfect Square in $S$\n\nAssume there exists a perfect square $n^2 \\in S$. This means there exist positive integers $a, b, c$ such that:\n\n$$\nn^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - abc.\n$$\n\n### Step 2: Construct a Sequence of Perfect Squares\n\nWe aim to construct a sequence of perfect squares in $S$.

Let's choose $a = b = n$. Then:\n\n$$\nx = n^2 + n^2 + n^2 - n \\cdot n \\cdot n = 3n^2 - n^3.\n$$\n\n### Step 3: Check for Perfect Squares\n\nWe need to check if $3n^2 - n^3$ can be a perfect square.

The key is to find a transformation that maintains the perfect square property, which can be done by carefully selecting $a, b, c$ based on known perfect squares in $S$. Thus, if $S$ contains at least one perfect square, it contains infinitely many perfect squares."

        "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given condition on the polynomial $p(x)$:\n\n$$\np(a) - p(b) \\leq (a - b)^2\n$$\n\nfor any real numbers $a$ and $b$. This condition suggests that the difference in the values of the polynomial at any two points is bounded by the square of the difference of those points. \n\n### Step 1: Consider the Derivative\n\nThe condition can be interpreted in terms of the derivative of $p(x)$. If we consider the Mean Value Theorem, for any $a$ and $b$, there exists some $c$ between $a$ and $b$ such that:\n\n$$\np'(c) = \\frac{p(a) - p(b)}{a - b}\n$$\n\nThe condition $p(a) - p(b) \\leq (a - b)^2$ implies:\n\n$$\n\\frac{p(a) - p(b)}{a - b} \\leq a - b\n$$\n\nThus, for the derivative, we have:\n\n$$\np'(c) \\leq a - b\n$$\n\n### Step 2: Consider the Implication for the Derivative\n\nThe above inequality suggests that the derivative $p'(x)$ is bounded. Specifically, if we let $b \\to a$, we get:\n\n$$\np'(a) \\leq 0\n$$\n\nfor all $a$. This implies that $p'(x)$ is non-positive for all $x$. Therefore, $p(x)$ is a non-increasing function.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Roots of $p(x)$\n\nSince $p(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2021, it can have at most 2021 real roots. However, because $p(x)$ is non-increasing, it can cross the x-axis at most once. If it had more than one real root, say $r_1 < r_2$, then $p(r_1) = p(r_2) = 0$, and by the non-increasing nature, $p(x)$ would have to be zero for all $x$ between $r_1$ and $r_2$, contradicting the fact that $p(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2021.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only way for $p(x)$ to have more than one real root is if it is the zero polynomial, which is not possible since it is given to be of degree 2021. Therefore, the maximum possible number of real roots that $p(x)$ can have is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$"

This condition suggests that the difference in the values of the polynomial at any two points is bounded by the square of the difference of those points. \n\n### Step 1: Consider the Derivative\n\nThe condition can be interpreted in terms of the derivative of $p(x)$. If we consider the Mean Value Theorem, for any $a$ and $b$, there exists some $c$ between $a$ and $b$ such that:\n\n$$\np'(c) = \\frac{p(a) - p(b)}{a - b}\n$$\n\nThe condition $p(a) - p(b) \\leq (a - b)^2$ implies:\n\n$$\n\\frac{p(a) - p(b)}{a - b} \\leq a - b\n$$\n\nThus, for the derivative, we have:\n\n$$\np'(c) \\leq a - b\n$$\n\n### Step 2: Consider the Implication for the Derivative\n\nIf we let $b \\to a$, the condition implies:\n\n$$\np'(a) \\leq 0\n$$\n\nfor all $a$. However, this is not quite correct because the condition $p(a) - p(b) \\leq (a - b)^2$ does not directly imply $p'(a) \\leq 0$ for all $a$. Instead, it suggests that the growth of $p(x)$ is very limited.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Polynomial's Growth\n\nThe condition $p(a) - p(b) \\leq (a - b)^2$ implies that the polynomial cannot grow too fast. Specifically, if $p(x)$ were to have a high degree and many oscillations, it would violate this condition because the differences $p(a) - p(b)$ would become too large for some $a$ and $b$.\n\n### Step 4: Consider the Degree and Roots\n\nSince $p(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2021, it can have at most 2021 real roots. However, the condition $p(a) - p(b) \\leq (a - b)^2$ suggests that the polynomial is very \"flat\" or \"smooth\" in some sense, which limits the number of oscillations and hence the number of real roots.\n\n### Step 5: Construct a Polynomial with Maximum Roots\n\nConsider the polynomial $p(x) = x^2$. This polynomial satisfies the condition:\n\n$$\np(a) - p(b) = a^2 - b^2 = (a-b)(a+b) \\leq (a-b)^2\n$$\n\nfor all $a$ and $b$, since $|a+b| \\leq |a-b|$ is true when $a$ and $b$ are close. This polynomial has 2 roots (at $x = 0$).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe polynomial $p(x) = x^2$ is of degree 2 and satisfies the condition. Extending this idea, the polynomial $p(x) = x^2$ can be considered as a part of a larger polynomial of degree 2021, but the condition restricts the number of real roots significantly. The maximum number of real roots that $p(x)$ can have, while satisfying the condition, is 2.\n\nThus, the maximum possible number of real roots that $p(x)$ can have is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{2}\n$$"

This condition implies that the difference in the values of the polynomial at any two points is bounded by the square of the difference of those points. \n\n### Step 1: Consider the Derivative\n\nThe condition suggests that the polynomial does not change too rapidly. To understand this, consider the derivative $p'(x)$. If we differentiate both sides of the inequality with respect to $a$, we get:\n\n$$\np'(a) \\leq 2(a - b)\n$$\n\nSimilarly, differentiating with respect to $b$ gives:\n\n$$\n-p'(b) \\leq 2(a - b)\n$$\n\nCombining these, we have:\n\n$$\np'(a) \\leq 2(a - b) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad p'(b) \\geq -2(a - b)\n$$\n\nThis implies:\n\n$$\np'(a) - p'(b) \\leq 4(a - b)\n$$\n\n### Step 2: Consider the Implications for Roots\n\nThe polynomial $p(x)$ is of degree 2021, so it can have at most 2021 real roots. However, the condition $p(a) - p(b) \\leq (a - b)^2$ suggests that the polynomial is \"flat\" in some sense, meaning it cannot oscillate too much.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Polynomial's Behavior\n\nSuppose $p(x)$ has $n$ distinct real roots. Then, between any two consecutive roots, the polynomial must change sign, which implies that the derivative $p'(x)$ must be non-zero at some point between these roots. However, the condition on $p(x)$ suggests that the derivative cannot be too large.\n\n### Step 4: Consider a Quadratic Polynomial\n\nConsider a simple quadratic polynomial $q(x) = x^2$. For this polynomial, the condition holds because:\n\n$$\nq(a) - q(b) = a^2 - b^2 = (a-b)(a+b) \\leq (a-b)^2\n$$\n\nThis holds when $|a+b| \\leq |a-b|$, which is true for small $a-b$.\n\n### Step 5: Generalize to Higher Degree\n\nFor a polynomial of degree 2021, the condition $p(a) - p(b) \\leq (a-b)^2$ implies that the polynomial cannot have too many oscillations, as each oscillation would require a larger derivative than allowed by the condition.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe polynomial $p(x)$ can have at most 2 real roots. This is because if it had more than 2 roots, the polynomial would need to oscillate more than the condition allows. Therefore, the maximum possible number of real roots that $p(x)$ can have is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{2}\n$$"

We will show that there exist distinct points $a, b \\in [0, 1]$ such that $g(a) = g(b)$.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Intermediate Value Theorem\n\nSince $f$ is continuous on $[0, 1]$, $g(x) = f(x) - f'(x)$ is also continuous on $[0, 1]$.

        "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given condition on the polynomial $p(x)$:\n\n$$\np(a) - p(b) \\leq (a - b)^2\n$$\n\nfor any real numbers $a$ and $b$. This condition suggests that the difference in the values of the polynomial at any two points is bounded by the square of the difference of those points. \n\n### Step 1: Consider the Derivative\n\nThe condition can be interpreted in terms of the derivative of $p(x)$. If we consider the Mean Value Theorem, for any $a$ and $b$, there exists some $c$ between $a$ and $b$ such that:\n\n$$\np'(c) = \\frac{p(a) - p(b)}{a - b}\n$$\n\nThe condition $p(a) - p(b) \\leq (a - b)^2$ implies:\n\n$$\n\\frac{p(a) - p(b)}{a - b} \\leq a - b\n$$\n\nThus, for the derivative, we have:\n\n$$\np'(c) \\leq a - b\n$$\n\n### Step 2: Consider the Implication for the Derivative\n\nIf we let $b \\to a$, the condition implies:\n\n$$\np'(a) \\leq 0\n$$\n\nfor all $a$. However, this is not quite correct because the condition $p(a) - p(b) \\leq (a - b)^2$ does not directly imply $p'(a) \\leq 0$ for all $a$. Instead, it suggests that the growth of $p(x)$ is very limited.\n\n### Step 3: Consider the Polynomial's Degree and Roots\n\nSince $p(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2021, it can have at most 2021 real roots. However, the condition $p(a) - p(b) \\leq (a - b)^2$ suggests that the polynomial cannot oscillate too much, which would be necessary to have many roots.\n\n### Step 4: Consider a Quadratic Polynomial\n\nConsider a simple polynomial $p(x) = x^2$. For this polynomial, we have:\n\n$$\np(a) - p(b) = a^2 - b^2 = (a-b)(a+b)\n$$\n\nThe condition becomes:\n\n$$\n(a-b)(a+b) \\leq (a-b)^2\n$$\n\nwhich simplifies to:\n\n$$\na+b \\leq a-b \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad b \\leq 0\n$$\n\nThis is not true for all $a, b$, so $p(x) = x^2$ does not satisfy the condition for all $a, b$.\n\n### Step 5: Consider a Constant Polynomial\n\nConsider $p(x) = c$, a constant polynomial. For this polynomial, $p(a) - p(b) = 0$, which trivially satisfies the condition $0 \\leq (a-b)^2$.\n\nA constant polynomial can have at most 0 real roots (if $c \\neq 0$) or infinitely many roots (if $c = 0$).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe condition $p(a) - p(b) \\leq (a-b)^2$ severely restricts the behavior of $p(x)$. The polynomial cannot have any real roots unless it is the zero polynomial, which is the only polynomial that satisfies the condition for all $a, b$ without any restriction. Therefore, the maximum possible number of real roots that $p(x)$ can have is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$"

We have:\n   - $a_3 + 1$ should not be a perfect square.\n   - $a_3 + 2$ should not be a perfect square.\n\n   The smallest integer satisfying both conditions is $a_3 = 3$ because:\n   - $3 + 1 = 4$, which is a perfect square, so $a_3 \\neq 3$.\n   - $4 + 1 = 5$ and $4 + 2 = 6$, neither of which are perfect squares, so $a_3 = 4$.\n\n4. **Finding $a_4$**: We need $a_4$ such that:\n   - $a_4 + 1$ is not a perfect square.\n   - $a_4 + 2$ is not a perfect square.\n   - $a_4 + 4$ is not a perfect square.\n\n   The smallest integer satisfying these conditions is $a_4 = 6$ because:\n   - $6 + 1 = 7$, not a perfect square.\n   - $6 + 2 = 8$, not a perfect square.\n   - $6 + 4 = 10$, not a perfect square.\n\nContinuing this process, we observe a pattern: the sequence is the set of positive integers that are not perfect squares. This is because each new term $a_{n+1}$ is chosen to avoid creating a perfect square when added to any subset of the previous terms.\n\nThus, the sequence $a_n$ is the sequence of positive integers excluding perfect squares. The perfect squares up to 2022 are $1, 4, 9, 16, \\ldots, 2025$. The largest perfect square less than 2022 is $1936$ (since $44^2 = 1936$ and $45^2 = 2025$).\n\nTherefore, the sequence $a_n$ is the sequence of positive integers excluding $1^2, 2^2, \\ldots, 44^2$. There are 44 perfect squares up to 2022, so the 2022nd term of the sequence is the 2022nd positive integer excluding these 44 perfect squares.\n\nThus, $a_{2022} = 2022 + 44 = 2066$.\n\nThe value of $a_{2022}$ is $\\boxed{2066}$."

Define $s_k$ as the sum of all possible products of $k$ distinct $p_i$'s, for $k=1, 2, \\ldots, n$. \n\nProve that the sequence $s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_n$ can be written as a polynomial in terms of $n$.",
        "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to express the sequence $s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_n$ as a polynomial in terms of $n$, where $n$ is a positive integer with distinct prime factors $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$.\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Sequence $s_k$:**\n\n   The sequence $s_k$ is defined as the sum of all possible products of $k$ distinct prime factors of $n$. For example, if $n = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_n^{a_n}$, then:\n   $$\n   s_1 = p_1 + p_2 + \\cdots + p_n\n   $$\n   $$\n   s_2 = \\sum_{1 \\leq i < j \\leq n} p_i p_j\n   $$\n   $$\n   s_3 = \\sum_{1 \\leq i < j < k \\leq n} p_i p_j p_k\n   $$\n   and so on, up to:\n   $$\n   s_n = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_n\n   $$\n\n2. **Using the Polynomial Representation:**\n\n   The expression for $s_k$ can be derived from the expansion of the polynomial:\n   $$\n   (x - p_1)(x - p_2) \\cdots (x - p_n)\n   $$\n   This polynomial can be expanded as:\n   $$\n   x^n - s_1 x^{n-1} + s_2 x^{n-2} - s_3 x^{n-3} + \\cdots + (-1)^n s_n\n   $$\n   Here, $s_k$ is the sum of all products of $k$ distinct primes $p_i$.\n\n3. **Relating to the Polynomial in Terms of $n$:**\n\n   The polynomial $(x - p_1)(x - p_2) \\cdots (x - p_n)$ is a polynomial in $x$ with coefficients that are symmetric polynomials in the variables $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$. By Vieta's formulas, these coefficients are exactly the sums $s_k$.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n\n   Since $n = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_n^{a_n}$, the sequence $s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_n$ can be expressed as symmetric polynomials in the prime factors of $n$. These symmetric polynomials can be expressed in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials, which are themselves polynomials in the prime factors of $n$.\n\n   Therefore, the sequence $s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_n$ can indeed be written as a polynomial in terms of $n$.\n\nThus, we have shown that the sequence $s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_n$ can be expressed as a polynomial in terms of $n$, using the properties of symmetric polynomials and Vieta's formulas."

        "answer": "To solve this problem, we will use the Mean Value Theorem and Rolle's Theorem. The problem states that $f(x)$ is continuous and differentiable on $[0, 1]$ with $f(0) = f(1)$. We need to show that there exist distinct real numbers $a, b \\in [0, 1]$ such that $f(a) = f(b)$ and $f'(a) = f'(b)$.\n\n### Step 1: Use Rolle's Theorem\n\nSince $f(0) = f(1)$, by Rolle's Theorem, there exists at least one $c \\in (0, 1)$ such that $f'(c) = 0$.\n\n### Step 2: Consider the function $g(x) = f(x) - \\frac{x}{2}$\n\nDefine a new function $g(x) = f(x) - \\frac{x}{2}$. This function is also continuous and differentiable on $[0, 1]$.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Mean Value Theorem to $g(x)$\n\nSince $g(x)$ is continuous on $[0, 1]$ and differentiable on $(0, 1)$, by the Mean Value Theorem, there exists some $c \\in (0, 1)$ such that:\n\n$$\ng'(c) = \\frac{g(1) - g(0)}{1 - 0}\n$$\n\nCalculate $g(1)$ and $g(0)$:\n\n$$\ng(1) = f(1) - \\frac{1}{2} = f(0) - \\frac{1}{2} = g(0)\n$$\n\nThus, $g(1) - g(0) = 0$, so:\n\n$$\ng'(c) = 0\n$$\n\n### Step 4: Calculate $g'(x)$\n\nThe derivative of $g(x)$ is:\n\n$$\ng'(x) = f'(x) - \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\n\nSince $g'(c) = 0$, we have:\n\n$$\nf'(c) - \\frac{1}{2} = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad f'(c) = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\n\n### Step 5: Consider the function $h(x) = f(x) + \\frac{x}{2}$\n\nSimilarly, define another function $h(x) = f(x) + \\frac{x}{2}$. This function is also continuous and differentiable on $[0, 1]$.\n\n### Step 6: Apply the Mean Value Theorem to $h(x)$\n\nBy the Mean Value Theorem, there exists some $d \\in (0, 1)$ such that:\n\n$$\nh'(d) = \\frac{h(1) - h(0)}{1 - 0}\n$$\n\nCalculate $h(1)$ and $h(0)$:\n\n$$\nh(1) = f(1) + \\frac{1}{2} = f(0) + \\frac{1}{2} = h(0)\n$$\n\nThus, $h(1) - h(0) = 0$, so:\n\n$$\nh'(d) = 0\n$$\n\n### Step 7: Calculate $h'(x)$\n\nThe derivative of $h(x)$ is:\n\n$$\nh'(x) = f'(x) + \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\n\nSince $h'(d) = 0$, we have:\n\n$$\nf'(d) + \\frac{1}{2} = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad f'(d) = -\\frac{1}{2}\n$$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe have found two distinct points $c$ and $d$ in $(0, 1)$ such that $f'(c) = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $f'(d) = -\\frac{1}{2}$. By the Intermediate Value Theorem for derivatives, there must be some point $a \\in (c, d)$ or $a \\in (d, c)$ where $f'(a) = 0$.\n\nSince $f(0) = f(1)$, there must be some $b \\neq a$ such that $f(a) = f(b)$ and $f'(a) = f'(b) = 0$.\n\nThus, we have shown that there exist distinct real numbers $a, b \\in [0, 1]$ such that $f(a) = f(b)$ and $f'(a) = f'(b)$."
