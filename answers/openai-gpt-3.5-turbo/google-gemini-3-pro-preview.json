        "answer": "**Theorem:** There exist infinitely many prime numbers.\n\n**Proof:**\nWe will prove this statement using a proof by contradiction (reductio ad absurdum). This proof is classically attributed to Euclid.\n\n**1. Assumption**\nAssume, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists a finite number of prime numbers.\nLet the set of all prime numbers be denoted by $P$. Since the set is finite, we can list its elements:\n$$P = \\{p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n\\}$$\nwhere $n$ is a positive integer representing the total count of prime numbers. We assume this list contains **every** prime number that exists.\n\n**2. Construction**\nConstruct a new integer $N$ defined as the product of all primes in our set $P$, plus one:\n$$N = (p_1 \\times p_2 \\times \\dots \\times p_n) + 1$$\nOr, using product notation:\n$$N = \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^{n} p_i \\right) + 1$$\n\n**3. Analysis of $N$**\nSince the smallest prime is 2, the product of primes is at least 2. Therefore, $N \\geq 3$.\nBy the **Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic**, every integer greater than 1 is either prime itself or can be represented as the product of prime numbers. Therefore, $N$ must have at least one prime divisor. Let us call this prime divisor $q$.\n\n**4. The Contradiction**\nSince we assumed that $P = \\{p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n\\}$ contains **all** prime numbers, the prime divisor $q$ must be one of the primes in the set $P$.\n$$q \\in \\{p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n\\}$$\nThis implies that $q$ divides the product of these primes:\n$$q \\mid \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^{n} p_i \\right)$$\nBy definition, $q$ is a divisor of $N$:\n$$q \\mid N$$\nIf an integer divides two numbers, it must also divide their difference. Therefore, $q$ must divide the difference between $N$ and the product of the primes:\n$$q \\mid \\left( N - \\prod_{i=1}^{n} p_i \\right)$$\nSubstituting the definition of $N$:\n$$q \\mid \\left( \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^{n} p_i + 1 \\right) - \\prod_{i=1}^{n} p_i \\right)$$\n$$q \\mid 1$$\nThis states that the prime number $q$ divides 1. However, by definition, a prime number is an integer greater than 1. No integer greater than 1 can divide 1.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\nWe have arrived at a contradiction. The assumption that the set of prime numbers is finite leads to a logical impossibility. Therefore, the assumption must be false.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe set of prime numbers is infinite.",

        "answer": "To solve this problem, we can model the grid and the coloring constraints using graph theory.\n\n### 1. Modeling the Problem\n\nLet the $10 \\times 10$ grid be represented by a graph $G = (V, E)$, where:\n- The set of vertices $V$ consists of the $100$ cells in the grid. Each cell is identified by its coordinates $(i, j)$ where $1 \\le i, j \\le 10$.\n- The set of edges $E$ connects any two cells that are adjacent. Two cells are adjacent if they share a common side.\n\nThe problem asks for the number of ways to assign a color $c(v) \\in \\{\\text{Black}, \\text{White}\\}$ to each vertex $v \\in V$ such that for any edge $(u, v) \\in E$, $c(u) \\neq c(v)$. This is exactly the problem of finding the number of proper 2-colorings of the grid graph $G$.\n\n### 2. Analyzing the Graph Properties\n\nTo determine the number of valid colorings, we examine two key properties of the grid graph: connectivity and bipartiteness.\n\n**Connectivity:**\nThe $10 \\times 10$ grid graph is **connected**. This means there is a path between any two cells in the grid. For example, to go from cell $(1, 1)$ to any cell $(i, j)$, one can traverse along the first row to $(1, j)$ and then down the column to $(i, j)$.\n\n**Bipartiteness:**\nThe grid graph is **bipartite**. A graph is bipartite if its vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets, $V_{even}$ and $V_{odd}$, such that every edge connects a vertex in $V_{even}$ to one in $V_{odd}$.\nFor a grid, we can define these sets based on the sum of the coordinates $i + j$:\n- $V_{even} = \\{ (i, j) \\mid i + j \\text{ is even} \\}$\n- $V_{odd} = \\{ (i, j) \\mid i + j \\text{ is odd} \\}$\n\nIf two cells $(i, j)$ and $(r, s)$ share a common side, the sum of their absolute coordinate differences is exactly 1 ($|i-r| + |j-s| = 1$). Consequently, the parity of the sum of the coordinates changes (e.g., if $i+j$ is even, then $(i\\pm 1) + j$ is odd). Therefore, adjacent cells always belong to different sets.\n\n### 3. Counting the Colorings\n\nFor a connected bipartite graph, the number of proper 2-colorings is exactly **2**. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Choice of the first cell:** Pick an arbitrary starting cell, say the top-left cell $(1, 1)$. We can color this cell either Black or White. There are **2 choices**.\n\n2.  **Propagation of constraints:** Once the color of $(1, 1)$ is chosen, the colors of its neighbors are forced. If $(1, 1)$ is Black, its neighbors $(1, 2)$ and $(2, 1)$ must be White. If $(1, 1)$ is White, they must be Black.\n\n3.  **Unique determination:** Because the graph is connected, this forcing propagates to every cell in the grid. The color of any cell $(i, j)$ is determined by its distance from $(1, 1)$. Specifically, if the shortest path distance (Manhattan distance) between $(1, 1)$ and $(i, j)$ is even, $(i, j)$ must have the same color as $(1, 1)$. If the distance is odd, it must have the opposite color.\n\n4.  **Consistency:** Because the graph is bipartite, it contains no odd cycles. This ensures that the constraints never conflict. No matter which path you take to reach a specific cell, the parity of the path length (and thus the required color) remains consistent.\n\nThus, the entire coloring of the grid is fully determined solely by the choice of color for the first cell.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince there are 2 possible colors for the first cell, and each choice leads to a unique valid configuration for the rest of the grid (often referred to as the two \"chessboard\" patterns), there are exactly 2 ways to color the grid.\n\n**Final Answer:** 2",

        "answer": "To prove that $p^2 - 1$ is divisible by 24 for any prime number $p > 3$, we will analyze the prime factorization of the divisor.\n\nNote that $24 = 3 \\times 8$. Since $\\gcd(3, 8) = 1$, it suffices to prove that $p^2 - 1$ is divisible by both 3 and 8.\n\nWe can factor the expression as a difference of squares:\n$$p^2 - 1 = (p - 1)(p + 1)$$\n\n### Part 1: Divisibility by 3\n\nConsider the three consecutive integers: $p - 1$, $p$, and $p + 1$.\nIn any sequence of three consecutive integers, exactly one of them must be divisible by 3.\n\nWe are given that $p$ is a prime number greater than 3.\n1.  Since $p$ is prime, its only divisors are 1 and $p$.\n2.  Since $p > 3$, $p$ cannot be equal to 3.\n3.  Therefore, $p$ is not divisible by 3.\n\nSince $p$ is not divisible by 3, one of its neighbors, $(p - 1)$ or $(p + 1)$, must be divisible by 3. Consequently, their product is divisible by 3:\n$$3 \\mid (p - 1)(p + 1) \\implies 3 \\mid (p^2 - 1)$$\n\n### Part 2: Divisibility by 8\n\nWe are given that $p$ is a prime number greater than 3. The only even prime number is 2. Therefore, $p$ must be an odd number.\n\nSince $p$ is odd, we can express it as $p = 2k + 1$ for some integer $k$. Let us substitute this into the factored expression:\n$$p^2 - 1 = (p - 1)(p + 1)$$\n$$p^2 - 1 = ((2k + 1) - 1)((2k + 1) + 1)$$\n$$p^2 - 1 = (2k)(2k + 2)$$\n$$p^2 - 1 = 2k \\cdot 2(k + 1)$$\n$$p^2 - 1 = 4k(k + 1)$$\n\nNow, consider the term $k(k + 1)$. This is the product of two consecutive integers ($k$ and $k+1$). In any pair of consecutive integers, one must be even (divisible by 2). Therefore, we can write $k(k + 1) = 2m$ for some integer $m$.\n\nSubstituting this back into our equation:\n$$p^2 - 1 = 4(2m) = 8m$$\n\nThus, $p^2 - 1$ is divisible by 8:\n$$8 \\mid (p^2 - 1)$$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe have established two facts:\n1.  $3 \\mid (p^2 - 1)$\n2.  $8 \\mid (p^2 - 1)$\n\nSince 3 and 8 are coprime ($\\gcd(3, 8) = 1$), the number $p^2 - 1$ must be divisible by their product, $3 \\times 8 = 24$.\n\n$$24 \\mid (p^2 - 1)$$\n\n**Final Answer:**\nFor any prime number $p > 3$, $p^2 - 1$ is divisible by 24.",
