        "answer": "## Step 1: Assume there are finitely many prime numbers\nWe start by assuming the opposite of what we want to prove: that there are finitely many prime numbers. Let's denote these prime numbers as $p_1, p_2, p_3, \\ldots, p_n$, where $n$ is a finite number.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the product of all assumed prime numbers plus one\nWe consider the number $N = p_1 \\cdot p_2 \\cdot p_3 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot p_n + 1$. This number is either prime or composite.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the case when N is prime\nIf $N$ is prime, then it is a new prime number not included in the list $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$ because $N > p_i$ for all $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n$. This contradicts the assumption that the list $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$ contains all prime numbers.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the case when N is composite\nIf $N$ is composite, then it must have a prime factor $p$. This prime factor $p$ cannot be any of $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$ because we assumed that $N = p_1 \\cdot p_2 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot p_n + 1$, and thus dividing $N$ by any of $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$ leaves a remainder of 1. Therefore, $p$ is a new prime number not in the list $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$, again contradicting the assumption that the list contains all prime numbers.\n\n## Step 5: Conclude the proof by contradiction\nIn both cases (whether $N$ is prime or composite), we reach a contradiction to the initial assumption that $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$ are all the prime numbers. This means our initial assumption that there are finitely many prime numbers must be false.\n\n## Step 6: State the conclusion\nTherefore, there are infinitely many prime numbers.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\infty}$",

    "question": "Consider a 10x10 grid where each cell is either black or white. How many ways can you color the cells such that no two adjacent cells share the same color? Two cells are considered adjacent if they share a common side.",

        "answer": "## Step 1: Understand the constraints of the problem\nThe problem involves a 10x10 grid where each cell can be either black or white. The condition is that no two adjacent cells can have the same color. Adjacency is defined as sharing a common side.\n\n## Step 2: Recognize the pattern for coloring\nTo satisfy the condition that no two adjacent cells share the same color, the grid must be colored in a checkerboard pattern. This is because in a checkerboard pattern, each cell is surrounded by cells of the opposite color, ensuring that no adjacent cells have the same color.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the number of ways to color the grid in a checkerboard pattern\nA checkerboard pattern can be achieved in two ways: starting with a black cell in the top-left corner or starting with a white cell in the top-left corner. The rest of the grid is then colored accordingly to maintain the checkerboard pattern.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of ways to color the grid\nSince the grid is 10x10, it has 100 cells. For a checkerboard pattern, once the color of the first cell is chosen, the colors of all other cells are determined because of the alternating pattern. There are only two possible configurations: one where the top-left cell is black and one where it is white.\n\n## Step 5: Consider if there are any other configurations\nGiven the constraint that no two adjacent cells can have the same color, any configuration other than a checkerboard pattern would violate this rule. Thus, there are no other valid configurations beyond the two checkerboard patterns.\n\n## Step 6: Provide the final count of valid configurations\nThere are only 2 valid ways to color the 10x10 grid such that no two adjacent cells share the same color, corresponding to the two possible checkerboard patterns.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",

        "answer": "## Step 1: Understand the problem statement\nWe are given a prime number $p$ greater than 3, and we need to prove that $p^2 - 1$ is always divisible by 24.\n\n## Step 2: Break down the requirements for divisibility by 24\nTo be divisible by 24, a number must be divisible by both 3 and 8, since $24 = 3 \\times 8$. We will check divisibility by 3 and 8 separately.\n\n## Step 3: Check divisibility by 3\nFor any prime $p > 3$, $p$ can be written as $p = 3k \\pm 1$, where $k$ is an integer. Thus, $p^2 = (3k \\pm 1)^2 = 9k^2 \\pm 6k + 1 = 3(3k^2 \\pm 2k) + 1$. Therefore, $p^2 - 1 = 3(3k^2 \\pm 2k)$, which is divisible by 3.\n\n## Step 4: Check divisibility by 8\nSince $p$ is a prime greater than 3, it is odd. Thus, $p$ can be written as $p = 2m + 1$, where $m$ is an integer. Then, $p^2 - 1 = (2m + 1)^2 - 1 = 4m^2 + 4m = 4m(m + 1)$. Since $m$ and $m+1$ are consecutive integers, one of them must be even, making $m(m+1)$ even. Hence, $4m(m+1)$ is divisible by 8.\n\n## Step 5: Combine the results for divisibility by 3 and 8\nSince $p^2 - 1$ is divisible by both 3 and 8, and 3 and 8 are relatively prime (their greatest common divisor is 1), $p^2 - 1$ is divisible by $3 \\times 8 = 24$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{p^2 - 1}$",
