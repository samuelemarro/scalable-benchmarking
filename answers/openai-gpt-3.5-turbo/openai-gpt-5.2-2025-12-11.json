Since $p_i$ divides the product $p_1p_2\\cdots p_n$, we have\n$$\np_i \\mid p_1p_2\\cdots p_n.\n$$\nIf $p_i$ also divided $N$, then $p_i$ would divide the difference\n$$\nN-(p_1p_2\\cdots p_n) = 1,\n$$\nwhich is impossible because no prime divides $1$. Hence,\n$$\np_i \\nmid N \\quad \\text{for all } i=1,\\dots,n.\n$$\n\n### But $N$ must have a prime divisor\nSince $N>1$, by the fundamental property of integers (every integer $>1$ has at least one prime divisor), there exists a prime $q$ such that\n$$\nq \\mid N.\n$$\nThis prime $q$ cannot be any of $p_1,\\dots,p_n$, because we just proved none of those divides $N$. Therefore $q$ is a prime not in our \u201ccomplete\u201d list.\n\nThis contradicts the assumption that $p_1,\\dots,p_n$ were all the primes.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe assumption that there are only finitely many primes leads to a contradiction.

A coloring with two colors (black/white) such that adjacent cells have different colors is exactly a **proper 2-coloring** of this graph.\n\n### Step 1: The grid graph is bipartite\nColor the cells by parity of $(\\text{row}+\\text{column})$:\n- Let $A=\\{(r,c): r+c \\text{ is even}\\}$\n- Let $B=\\{(r,c): r+c \\text{ is odd}\\}$\n\nAny two side-adjacent cells differ by 1 in either row or column, so $r+c$ changes parity. Hence every edge goes between $A$ and $B$. Therefore $G$ is bipartite.\n\n### Step 2: A connected bipartite graph has exactly 2 proper 2-colorings\nThe $10\\times 10$ grid is connected (you can move between any two cells using side-adjacent steps). In a connected bipartite graph, once you choose the color of a single vertex, the colors of all others are forced by the \u201cadjacent cells differ\u201d rule. Thus:\n- Choose black for one cell $\\Rightarrow$ the entire coloring is forced (a checkerboard pattern).\n- Choose white instead $\\Rightarrow$ you get the swapped checkerboard pattern.\n\nSo there are exactly $2$ valid colorings.\n\n### Final answer\n$$\n\\boxed{2}\n$$",
