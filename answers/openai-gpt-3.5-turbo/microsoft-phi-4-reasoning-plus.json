        "answer": "To prove that there exist infinitely many prime numbers, we will use a classic proof by contradiction, often attributed to Euclid.\n\n### Proof by Contradiction\n\n1. **Assume the Opposite**: Suppose there are only finitely many prime numbers. Let's denote these primes as $p_1, p_2, p_3, \\ldots, p_n$.\n\n2. **Construct a New Number**: Consider the number $N$ defined as:\n   $$\n   N = p_1 \\times p_2 \\times p_3 \\times \\cdots \\times p_n + 1\n   $$\n   This number $N$ is one more than the product of all the primes we assumed to exist.\n\n3. **Analyze the Divisibility of $N$**: By construction, $N$ is not divisible by any of the primes $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$. If we divide $N$ by any prime $p_i$, the remainder is 1:\n   $$\n   N \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p_i}\n   $$\n   This is because:\n   $$\n   N = p_1 \\times p_2 \\times \\cdots \\times p_n + 1 \\equiv 0 + 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p_i}\n   $$\n\n4. **Conclusion from Divisibility**: Since $N$ is not divisible by any of the primes $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$, it must either be prime itself or have a prime factor that is not in our list of all primes.\n\n5. **Contradiction**: In either case, we have found a prime number that is not in our original list of all primes, contradicting the assumption that $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$ were all the primes.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, our initial assumption that there are only finitely many primes must be false. Hence, there are infinitely many prime numbers.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThere exist infinitely many prime numbers. This conclusion follows from the contradiction that arises when assuming a finite number of primes.",

        "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to color a $10 \\times 10$ grid such that no two adjacent cells share the same color. This is a classic problem of coloring a grid using two colors, often referred to as a \"checkerboard\" or \"bipartite\" coloring.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We have a $10 \\times 10$ grid.\n   - Each cell can be either black or white.\n   - No two adjacent cells (sharing a side) can have the same color.\n\n2. **Checkerboard Pattern:**\n   - A valid coloring pattern is similar to a checkerboard, where cells alternate colors.\n   - In a checkerboard pattern, if the top-left cell is black, then:\n     - All cells in even rows and even columns are black.\n     - All cells in odd rows and odd columns are black.\n     - All cells in even rows and odd columns are white.\n     - All cells in odd rows and even columns are white.\n\n3. **Two Possible Patterns:**\n   - **Pattern 1:** Top-left cell is black.\n   - **Pattern 2:** Top-left cell is white.\n\n4. **Counting the Patterns:**\n   - For Pattern 1 (top-left cell is black), the coloring is uniquely determined by the checkerboard pattern.\n   - For Pattern 2 (top-left cell is white), the coloring is also uniquely determined by the checkerboard pattern.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - There are exactly two ways to color the grid such that no two adjacent cells share the same color: one starting with a black top-left cell and the other starting with a white top-left cell.\n\nThus, the number of ways to color the $10 \\times 10$ grid under the given conditions is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{2}\n$$",

        "answer": "To prove that $p^2 - 1$ is divisible by 24 for any prime $p > 3$, we will use properties of prime numbers and modular arithmetic.\n\n### Step 1: Express $p^2 - 1$ in a factorable form\n\nWe start by rewriting $p^2 - 1$ as a difference of squares:\n\n$$\np^2 - 1 = (p - 1)(p + 1)\n$$\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the factors\n\nThe expression $(p - 1)(p + 1)$ represents the product of two consecutive even numbers because $p$ is an odd prime greater than 3. Therefore, both $p - 1$ and $p + 1$ are even.\n\n### Step 3: Divisibility by 8\n\nSince $p - 1$, $p$, and $p + 1$ are three consecutive integers, one of them must be divisible by 4. Since $p$ is odd, both $p - 1$ and $p + 1$ are even, and one of them must be divisible by 4. Thus, the product $(p - 1)(p + 1)$ is divisible by $2 \\times 4 = 8$.\n\n### Step 4: Divisibility by 3\n\nAmong any three consecutive integers $p - 1$, $p$, and $p + 1$, one must be divisible by 3. Since $p$ is a prime greater than 3, it cannot be divisible by 3. Therefore, either $p - 1$ or $p + 1$ must be divisible by 3. Thus, the product $(p - 1)(p + 1)$ is divisible by 3.\n\n### Step 5: Combine divisibility results\n\nSince $(p - 1)(p + 1)$ is divisible by both 8 and 3, and 8 and 3 are coprime, it follows that $(p - 1)(p + 1)$ is divisible by their product:\n\n$$\n8 \\times 3 = 24\n$$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThus, for any prime $p > 3$, $p^2 - 1 = (p - 1)(p + 1)$ is divisible by 24. Therefore, we have shown that:\n\n$$\np^2 - 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{24}\n$$\n\nThis completes the proof. The final answer is that $p^2 - 1$ is always divisible by 24 for any prime $p > 3$.",
