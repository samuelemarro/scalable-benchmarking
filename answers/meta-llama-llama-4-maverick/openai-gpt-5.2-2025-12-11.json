The problem must be well-posed, clear, non-trivial, and solvable with established mathematical methods.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the domain\nThe domain specified is Combinatorics, which involves the study of counting, arranging, and optimizing objects in various ways. It encompasses topics such as permutations, combinations, graph theory, and more.\n\n## Step 3: Generate a problem\nTo create a challenging problem, let's consider a topic within Combinatorics that is both interesting and requires substantial reasoning. A potential topic is graph theory, specifically focusing on graph coloring or connectivity.\n\n## Step 4: Formulate the problem\nLet's formulate a problem: \"Prove that in any simple graph with $n$ vertices, if the graph is connected and has no cycles (i.e., it's a tree), then it has exactly $n-1$ edges.\"\n\n## Step 5: Verify the problem against the quality rubric\n- **Well-Posedness and Completeness**: The problem is self-contained, defines the necessary terms (simple graph, connected, no cycles, tree), and asks for a proof.\n- **Clarity**: The terms used are standard in graph theory, and the task is clear.\n- **Non-Triviality**: The problem requires understanding of graph theory and a proof involving induction or another suitable method, making it non-trivial.\n- **Solvability and Verification**: The statement is a known fact in graph theory and can be proven using established methods.\n\n## Step 6: Provide the solution\nTo solve this, we can use induction on $n$. For $n=1$, a tree has 0 edges, and $1-1=0$, so the statement holds. For $n>1$, assume the statement is true for all trees with fewer than $n$ vertices. A tree with $n$ vertices has at least one leaf (a vertex of degree 1); removing this leaf and its edge gives a tree with $n-1$ vertices. By the induction hypothesis, this smaller tree has $(n-1)-1 = n-2$ edges. Adding back the removed edge gives $n-2 + 1 = n-1$ edges, proving the statement for $n$.\n\n## Step 7: Format the output\nLet's format the problem and solution according to the required structure.\n\n\nLet $G$ be a simple graph with $n$ vertices.

A challenging problem could involve proving a property related to prime numbers or solving a specific type of Diophantine equation.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a problem that meets the criteria.\nLet's consider a problem involving the sum of divisors of a number and its relation to perfect numbers. A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors, excluding the number itself.\n\n## Step 4: Specify the problem.\nConsider the following problem: \"Prove that if $n$ is an even perfect number, then $n = 2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$, where $2^p - 1$ is a Mersenne prime.\"\n\n## Step 5: Provide the solution to the problem.\nTo solve this, we need to understand the definition of an even perfect number and its relation to Mersenne primes.\n\n## Step 6: Recall the definition and properties of even perfect numbers.\nAn even perfect number $n$ can be written as $n = 2^{k-1}(2^k - 1)$, where $2^k - 1$ is prime. This is known as the Euclid-Euler theorem.\n\n## Step 7: State the Euclid-Euler theorem.\nThe Euclid-Euler theorem states that every even perfect number is of the form $2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$, where $2^p - 1$ is a Mersenne prime (i.e., $2^p - 1$ is prime).\n\n## Step 8: Provide the proof or reasoning for the given statement.\nThe proof involves two main parts: (1) showing that any number of the form $2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$, where $2^p - 1$ is prime, is perfect, and (2) showing that every even perfect number is of this form.\n\n## Step 9: Outline the proof that $2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$ is perfect when $2^p - 1$ is prime.\nLet $n = 2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$. The sum of divisors of $n$, $\\sigma(n)$, is given by $\\sigma(n) = \\sigma(2^{p-1})\\sigma(2^p - 1)$. Since $2^p - 1$ is prime, $\\sigma(2^p - 1) = 2^p$. Also, $\\sigma(2^{p-1}) = 1 + 2 + 2^2 + \\cdots + 2^{p-1} = 2^p - 1$. Thus, $\\sigma(n) = (2^p - 1) \\cdot 2^p = 2 \\cdot 2^{p-1}(2^p - 1) = 2n$, proving $n$ is perfect.\n\n## Step 10: Outline the proof that every even perfect number is of the form $2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$.\nLet $n$ be an even perfect number. Then $n = 2^k \\cdot m$, where $m$ is odd. Since $n$ is perfect, $\\sigma(n) = 2n$. Using the multiplicative property of $\\sigma$, we have $\\sigma(n) = \\sigma(2^k)\\sigma(m) = (2^{k+1} - 1)\\sigma(m)$. Thus, $(2^{k+1} - 1)\\sigma(m) = 2^{k+1}m$. This implies $2^{k+1} - 1$ divides $m$, so $m = (2^{k+1} - 1)d$ for some $d$. Substituting back gives $\\sigma(m) = 2^{k+1}d$. For $d = 1$, $m = 2^{k+1} - 1$ is prime, and $\\sigma(m) = m + 1 = 2^{k+1}$, which matches our requirement. For $d > 1$, it leads to a contradiction because $\\sigma(m) \\geq m + d > 2d$, unless $d = 1$ and $m$ is prime.\n\n## Step 11: Conclude the solution.\nThe given statement is a direct consequence of the Euclid-Euler theorem, which characterizes even perfect numbers.\n\nThe final answer is: \n\nProve that if $n$ is an even perfect number, then $n = 2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$, where $2^p - 1$ is a Mersenne prime.",

This includes partially ordered sets (posets), lattices, Boolean algebras, and other related structures.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a problem that fits the domain\nTo create a problem, we need to consider what aspects of \"Order, lattices, ordered algebraic structures\" can be explored.

A Boolean algebra is a distributive lattice with the additional property that every element has a complement.\n\n## Step 5: State the problem\n\"Let $B$ be a Boolean algebra. Prove that for any elements $a, b \\in B$, the following identity holds: $a \\vee (a \\wedge b) = a$.\"\n\n## Step 6: Provide a solution to the problem\nTo prove $a \\vee (a \\wedge b) = a$, we can use the properties of a Boolean algebra, specifically the absorption laws.\n\n## Step 7: Write out the solution in detail\nFirst, recall that a Boolean algebra is a distributive lattice with complementation. The absorption laws state that for any $a, b$ in the Boolean algebra, $a \\vee (a \\wedge b) = a$ and $a \\wedge (a \\vee b) = a$. We need to prove the first absorption law.\n\n## Step 8: Apply the properties of a lattice to prove the identity\nBy definition of a lattice, $a \\wedge b \\leq a$ because $a$ is an upper bound of $a$ and $a \\wedge b$, and $a \\wedge b$ is the greatest lower bound of $a$ and $b$. Thus, $a \\vee (a \\wedge b) = a$ because $a \\vee x = a$ whenever $x \\leq a$.\n\n## Step 9: Formalize the solution\nGiven $a, b \\in B$, since $a \\wedge b \\leq a$, we have $a \\vee (a \\wedge b) = a$ due to the property that $x \\leq y$ implies $y \\vee x = y$. Thus, $a \\vee (a \\wedge b) = a$.\n\n## Step 10: Present the problem and solution in the required format\n\nLet $B$ be a Boolean algebra.

    "question": "## Step 1: Understand the task\nThe task is to generate a challenging mathematics problem in the domain of commutative algebra, along with a complete and verifiable solution. The problem must be well-posed, clear, non-trivial, and solvable with established mathematical methods.\n\n## Step 2: Identify a suitable topic in commutative algebra\nCommutative algebra involves the study of commutative rings and their ideals, modules, and algebras. A challenging problem could involve understanding the properties of ideals, quotient rings, or the behavior of polynomials over certain rings.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a specific problem\nLet's consider a problem involving the properties of ideals in a polynomial ring. Specifically, we can examine the ideal generated by a set of polynomials and ask questions about its properties, such as whether it is prime or maximal.\n\n## Step 4: Construct the problem\nConsider the polynomial ring $\\mathbb{Q}[x, y]$ and the ideal $I = (x^2 + y^2, xy)$. We can ask: Is the ideal $I$ prime? To make it more challenging and ensure it's well-posed, we can ask to determine whether $I$ is radical, i.e., whether it is equal to its radical $\\sqrt{I}$.\n\n## Step 5: Write down the problem statement\nLet $I = (x^2 + y^2, xy)$ be an ideal in $\\mathbb{Q}[x, y]$. Determine whether $I = \\sqrt{I}$, where $\\sqrt{I} = \\{f \\in \\mathbb{Q}[x, y] \\mid f^n \\in I \\text{ for some } n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$.\n\n## Step 6: Provide the solution\nTo determine if $I = \\sqrt{I}$, we first need to understand what $\\sqrt{I}$ is. An element $f \\in \\mathbb{Q}[x, y]$ is in $\\sqrt{I}$ if $f^n \\in I$ for some $n$. We need to check if there are elements in $\\sqrt{I}$ that are not in $I$.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze the ideal $I$\nTo check if $I = \\sqrt{I}$, let's first examine the quotient ring $\\mathbb{Q}[x, y]/I$. The ideal $I$ contains $x^2 + y^2$ and $xy$, which implies that $x^2 + y^2$ and $xy$ are zero in $\\mathbb{Q}[x, y]/I$. We can simplify this by observing that $x^2y + y^3 = 0$ and $x^2y = 0$ in $\\mathbb{Q}[x, y]/I$, implying $y^3 = 0$ in $\\mathbb{Q}[x, y]/I$. Similarly, $x^3 = 0$.\n\n## Step 8: Check if $I$ is radical\nSince $x^3 = 0$ and $y^3 = 0$ in $\\mathbb{Q}[x, y]/I$, it follows that $x, y \\in \\sqrt{I}$ because $x^3, y^3 \\in I$. We need to verify if $x$ and $y$ are in $I$. If not, then $I \\neq \\sqrt{I}$.\n\n## Step 9: Verify if $x$ and $y$ are in $I$\nTo check if $x \\in I$, we need to see if there exist $f, g \\in \\mathbb{Q}[x, y]$ such that $x = f(x^2 + y^2) + g(xy)$. This simplifies to checking if $x$ can be expressed as a combination of $x^2 + y^2$ and $xy$, which is not possible because any element in $I$ is of degree at least 2.\n\n## Step 10: Conclude on $I = \\sqrt{I}$\nSince $x, y \\in \\sqrt{I}$ but $x, y \\notin I$, it follows that $I \\neq \\sqrt{I}$. Thus, $I$ is not radical.\n\nThe final answer is: \n\nLet $I = (x^2 + y^2, xy)$ be an ideal in $\\mathbb{Q}[x, y]$. Determine whether $I = \\sqrt{I}$, where $\\sqrt{I} = \\{f \\in \\mathbb{Q}[x, y] \\mid f^n \\in I \\text{ for some } n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$.",

The problem should be well-posed, clear, non-trivial, and solvable with established mathematical methods.\n\n## Step 2: Identify a suitable topic within algebraic geometry\nAlgebraic geometry is a broad field that involves the study of geometric objects, such as varieties and schemes, using tools from abstract algebra. A suitable topic could involve the study of curves, surfaces, or higher-dimensional varieties, and their properties.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a specific problem\nLet's consider a problem involving the intersection of curves on a surface. A classic result in algebraic geometry is B\u00e9zout's theorem, which describes the intersection of two curves on a projective plane. We can formulate a problem related to this.\n\n## Step 4: State the problem\nConsider two curves $C_1$ and $C_2$ on $\\mathbb{P}^2$, defined by homogeneous polynomials $f(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 - z^2$ and $g(x,y,z) = xy - z^2$, respectively. Find the number of intersection points of $C_1$ and $C_2$ in $\\mathbb{P}^2$, counted with multiplicity.\n\n## Step 5: Provide the solution\nTo find the intersection points, we need to solve the system of equations given by $f(x,y,z) = 0$ and $g(x,y,z) = 0$. This means we have to solve $x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = 0$ and $xy - z^2 = 0$ simultaneously.\n\n## Step 6: Solve the system of equations\nFirst, from $xy - z^2 = 0$, we can express $z^2 = xy$. Substituting $z^2$ into the first equation gives $x^2 + y^2 - xy = 0$. This is a homogeneous equation in $x$ and $y$, which can be solved by considering it as a quadratic form.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze the quadratic form\nThe equation $x^2 - xy + y^2 = 0$ can be analyzed by finding its roots. This is equivalent to solving $x^2 - xy + y^2 = 0$ for $x$ in terms of $y$ (or vice versa), treating it as a quadratic equation.\n\n## Step 8: Solve for $x$ in terms of $y$\nUsing the quadratic formula, $x = \\frac{y \\pm \\sqrt{y^2 - 4y^2}}{2} = \\frac{y \\pm \\sqrt{-3y^2}}{2}$. For $y \\neq 0$, this simplifies to $x = \\frac{y(1 \\pm i\\sqrt{3})}{2}$. Thus, $x = y\\omega$ or $x = y\\omega^2$, where $\\omega$ is a primitive third root of unity.\n\n## Step 9: Determine the intersection points\nFor $x = y\\omega$ and $x = y\\omega^2$, substituting back into $xy = z^2$ gives $y^2\\omega = z^2$ and $y^2\\omega^2 = z^2$, respectively. This implies $z = \\pm y\\sqrt{\\omega}$ and $z = \\pm y\\sqrt{\\omega^2}$. However, we must consider the projective nature and the fact that we're working with homogeneous coordinates.\n\n## Step 10: Count the intersection points with multiplicity\nSince $\\omega$ and $\\omega^2$ are not real, and we're working over $\\mathbb{C}$, we need to consider the solutions in $\\mathbb{P}^2(\\mathbb{C})$. The solutions are given by the pairs $(x:y:z)$ satisfying both equations. We need to check if there are any solutions where $y = 0$, which would imply $x = 0$ and thus $z = 0$, but $(0,0,0)$ is not a valid point in $\\mathbb{P}^2$.\n\n## Step 11: Apply B\u00e9zout's theorem for a simpler solution\nB\u00e9zout's theorem states that two curves of degrees $d_1$ and $d_2$ intersect in $d_1d_2$ points, counted with multiplicity, if they have no common components. Here, $C_1$ and $C_2$ are both of degree 2, so they should intersect in $2 \\times 2 = 4$ points.\n\nThe final answer is: \n\nConsider two curves $C_1$ and $C_2$ on $\\mathbb{P}^2$, defined by homogeneous polynomials $f(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 - z^2$ and $g(x,y,z) = xy - z^2$, respectively.

This polynomial factors as $(x-1)(x^2 + x + 1) = 0$. The roots are $1$, $e^{2\\pi i/3}$, and $e^{4\\pi i/3}$. Since $A$ satisfies this polynomial, its eigenvalues must be among these roots. Because the minimal polynomial of $A$ divides $x^3 - 1$ and has distinct roots (since $x^3 - 1$ has distinct roots), $A$ is diagonalizable over $\\mathbb{C}$.\n\n## Step 7: Write the problem and solution in the required format\n\nLet $A$ be a $3 \\times 3$ real matrix such that $A^3 = I$, where $I$ is the $3 \\times 3$ identity matrix. Prove that $A$ is diagonalizable over $\\mathbb{C}$.",

    "question": "## Step 1: Understand the task and the domain\nThe task is to generate a challenging but solvable mathematics problem in the domain of associative rings and algebras, along with a complete and verifiable solution. The problem should be well-posed, clear, non-trivial, and solvable with established mathematical methods.\n\n## Step 2: Identify a suitable topic within associative rings and algebras\nAssociative rings and algebras involve the study of algebraic structures with associative multiplication. A suitable topic could involve properties of ideals, quotient rings, or specific types of algebras like matrix algebras.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a problem\nLet's consider a problem involving the properties of a specific type of associative algebra. For instance, we could explore the characteristics of a matrix algebra over a ring.\n\n## Step 4: Generate a specific problem\nConsider the ring $R = \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ and the matrix algebra $M_2(R)$ of $2 \\times 2$ matrices with entries in $R$. Let's examine the properties of ideals in $M_2(R)$.\n\n## Step 5: Formulate the problem statement\n\"Let $R = \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ and consider the matrix algebra $M_2(R)$. Prove that $M_2(R)$ is not a simple ring, i.e., it has a non-trivial ideal.\"\n\n## Step 6: Provide the solution\nTo solve this, we need to show that there exists a non-trivial ideal in $M_2(R)$. An ideal $I$ in $M_2(R)$ is a subset that is closed under addition and under multiplication by any element of $M_2(R)$ from either side.\n\n## Step 7: Identify a non-trivial ideal\nConsider the set $I$ of matrices in $M_2(R)$ where all entries are even (i.e., $0$ or $2$ mod $4$). This set is non-empty and not equal to $M_2(R)$ because it does not contain matrices with odd entries.\n\n## Step 8: Verify that $I$ is an ideal\nFor $I$ to be an ideal, it must be closed under addition and under multiplication by elements of $M_2(R)$. For any two matrices $A, B \\in I$, $A + B$ has even entries because the sum of even numbers is even, so $A + B \\in I$. For any $A \\in I$ and $C \\in M_2(R)$, the product $CA$ and $AC$ will have entries that are products and sums of products involving elements of $R$. Since $A$ has even entries, $CA$ and $AC$ will also have even entries because multiplying any element of $R$ by an even element results in an even element.\n\n## Step 9: Check if $I$ is non-trivial\n$I$ is non-trivial if it is not the zero ideal and not the entire ring $M_2(R)$. The zero matrix is in $I$, and there are non-zero matrices in $I$ (e.g., $\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$), so $I$ is not the zero ideal. $I$ is not $M_2(R)$ because, for example, $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\notin I$.\n\n## Step 10: Conclude the solution\nSince $I$ is a non-trivial ideal, $M_2(R)$ is not a simple ring.\n\nThe final answer is: \n\nLet $R = \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ and consider the matrix algebra $M_2(R)$. Prove that $M_2(R)$ is not a simple ring, i.e., it has a non-trivial ideal.",

    "question": "## Step 1: Understand the task and the domain\nThe task is to generate a challenging but solvable mathematics problem in the domain of \"Group theory and generalizations\" along with a complete and verifiable solution. The problem should be well-posed, clear, non-trivial, and solvable with established mathematical methods.\n\n## Step 2: Identify a suitable topic within Group theory and generalizations\nGroup theory is a branch of abstract algebra that studies the symmetric aspects of objects and the transformations that preserve those symmetries. A suitable topic could involve properties of groups, such as subgroup structures, homomorphisms, or specific types of groups like cyclic or symmetric groups.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a challenging problem\nTo create a challenging problem, we can consider a topic like the classification of groups or the study of group homomorphisms. A potential problem could involve determining the number of homomorphisms between two given groups or analyzing the structure of a specific group.\n\n## Step 4: Generate a specific problem\nLet's consider the problem of finding the number of homomorphisms from the cyclic group of order 12, $\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$, to the symmetric group $S_3$. This involves understanding the structure of both groups and applying knowledge about homomorphisms.\n\n## Step 5: State the problem formally\nThe problem can be stated as: \"Let $\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ be the cyclic group of order 12 and $S_3$ be the symmetric group on 3 elements. Determine the number of homomorphisms from $\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ to $S_3$.\"\n\n## Step 6: Provide the solution\nTo solve this, we need to understand that a homomorphism $f: \\mathbb{Z}_{12} \\to S_3$ is determined by $f(1)$, where $1$ is a generator of $\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$. The element $f(1)$ must have an order that divides 12. $S_3$ has elements of orders 1, 2, and 3. We need to count how many elements in $S_3$ have orders that divide 12.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze the elements of $S_3$\n$S_3 = \\{e, (12), (13), (23), (123), (132)\\}$. The identity $e$ has order 1, the transpositions $(12), (13), (23)$ have order 2, and the 3-cycles $(123), (132)$ have order 3. The orders of elements in $S_3$ that divide 12 are 1, 2, and 3.\n\n## Step 8: Count the possible images of $1 \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$\nThere is 1 element of order 1, 3 elements of order 2, and 2 elements of order 3. So, $f(1)$ can be any of these 6 elements because their orders divide 12.\n\n## Step 9: Conclude the number of homomorphisms\nSince $f(1)$ can be any of the 6 elements (1 of order 1, 3 of order 2, and 2 of order 3), there are 6 possible homomorphisms from $\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ to $S_3$.\n\n## Step 10: Format the problem and solution according to the required output format\n\nLet $\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ be the cyclic group of order 12 and $S_3$ be the symmetric group on 3 elements. Determine the number of homomorphisms from $\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ to $S_3$.",

The problem must be well-posed, clear, non-trivial, and solvable with established mathematical methods.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the specific area within real functions to focus on.\nGiven the broad domain of real functions, we can consider various aspects such as differentiation, integration, functional equations, or properties of specific types of functions (e.g., continuous, differentiable, integrable).\n\n## Step 3: Choose a specific topic within real functions that can be used to create a challenging problem.\nLet's consider the topic of functional equations, which involves finding a function that satisfies a given equation involving the function and its inputs.\n\n## Step 4: Generate a challenging problem in the chosen topic.\nConsider the functional equation $f(x + y) = \\frac{f(x) + f(y)}{1 - f(x)f(y)}$ for $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$, where $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$. The task is to find all $f$ that satisfy this equation.\n\n## Step 5: Ensure the problem is well-posed and meets the quality rubric.\nThe given functional equation is well-defined, and the task is clear. We need to verify that it's non-trivial and solvable.\n\n## Step 6: Provide a solution to the generated problem.\nTo solve $f(x + y) = \\frac{f(x) + f(y)}{1 - f(x)f(y)}$, let's first check if there are any obvious solutions. For $y = 0$, we get $f(x) = \\frac{f(x) + f(0)}{1 - f(x)f(0)}$. This simplifies to $f(x)(1 - f(x)f(0)) = f(x) + f(0)$, or $f(x) - f(x)^2f(0) = f(x) + f(0)$, leading to $-f(x)^2f(0) = f(0)$. If $f(0) \\neq 0$, this gives $f(x)^2 = -1$ for all $x$, which is impossible for real-valued $f$. Thus, $f(0) = 0$.\n\n## Step 7: Continue solving the functional equation.\nSetting $y = x$, we have $f(2x) = \\frac{2f(x)}{1 - f(x)^2}$. This is a useful relation but let's first explore the derivative of $f$ if it exists. Assuming $f$ is differentiable, differentiating both sides with respect to $y$ and then setting $y = 0$ gives $f'(x) = \\frac{f'(0)(1 + f(x)^2)}{(1 - f(x)f(0))^2} = f'(0)(1 + f(x)^2)$ because $f(0) = 0$. So, $f'(x) = f'(0)(1 + f(x)^2)$.\n\n## Step 8: Solve the differential equation obtained from the functional equation.\nThe differential equation $f'(x) = f'(0)(1 + f(x)^2)$ can be solved by separation of variables: $\\frac{df}{1 + f^2} = f'(0)dx$. Integrating both sides gives $\\arctan(f(x)) = f'(0)x + C$, where $C$ is a constant. Since $f(0) = 0$, we have $C = 0$. Thus, $f(x) = \\tan(f'(0)x)$.\n\n## Step 9: Verify that the solution satisfies the original functional equation.\nSubstituting $f(x) = \\tan(f'(0)x)$ into the original equation: $\\tan(f'(0)(x+y)) = \\frac{\\tan(f'(0)x) + \\tan(f'(0)y)}{1 - \\tan(f'(0)x)\\tan(f'(0)y)}$, which is a known trigonometric identity, thus verifying that $f(x) = \\tan(f'(0)x)$ is a solution.\n\n## Step 10: Check if there are any constraints on $f'(0)$.\nFor $f(x) = \\tan(f'(0)x)$ to be defined for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $f'(0)$ must be $0$, otherwise, $f(x)$ will have discontinuities. If $f'(0) = 0$, then $f(x) = 0$ for all $x$, which is indeed a solution.\n\n## Step 11: Formulate the final problem and solution.\nLet's formulate the problem: \"Find all $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy $f(x + y) = \\frac{f(x) + f(y)}{1 - f(x)f(y)}$ for all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\"\n\n\nFind all $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy $f(x + y) = \\frac{f(x) + f(y)}{1 - f(x)f(y)}$ for all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.",

    "question": "## Step 1: Understand the task\nThe task is to generate a challenging mathematics problem in the domain of \"Functions of a complex variable\" along with a complete and verifiable solution. The problem must be well-posed, clear, non-trivial, and solvable with established mathematical methods.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the domain and requirements\nThe domain is \"Functions of a complex variable.\" This involves complex analysis, including topics like analytic functions, contour integration, and possibly properties of specific functions like the exponential or logarithmic function in the complex plane.\n\n## Step 3: Generate a problem\nTo create a challenging problem, we should consider a topic that requires a good understanding of complex analysis. One such topic is contour integration and the application of Cauchy's Integral Formula or the Residue Theorem.\n\n## Step 4: Formulate the problem\nLet's consider a problem that involves evaluating a contour integral using the Residue Theorem, which is a fundamental technique in complex analysis.\n\n## Step 5: Specify the problem\nThe problem could be: \"Evaluate the integral $\\oint_{|z|=2} \\frac{e^z}{z^2 + 1} dz$, where the contour $|z| = 2$ is traversed in the positive direction.\"\n\n## Step 6: Provide the solution\nTo solve $\\oint_{|z|=2} \\frac{e^z}{z^2 + 1} dz$, first identify the singularities of the integrand within the contour $|z| = 2$. The singularities occur at $z = \\pm i$, both of which are inside $|z| = 2$ since $|i| = |-i| = 1 < 2$.\n\n## Step 7: Apply the Residue Theorem\nThe Residue Theorem states that $\\oint_C f(z) dz = 2\\pi i \\sum \\text{Res}(f, z_j)$, where $z_j$ are the singularities enclosed by $C$. We need to calculate the residues at $z = i$ and $z = -i$.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the residue at $z = i$\nThe residue of $\\frac{e^z}{z^2 + 1}$ at $z = i$ can be found using the formula for simple poles: $\\text{Res}(f, z_0) = \\lim_{z \\to z_0} (z - z_0)f(z)$. So, $\\text{Res}(f, i) = \\lim_{z \\to i} (z - i)\\frac{e^z}{(z - i)(z + i)} = \\lim_{z \\to i} \\frac{e^z}{z + i} = \\frac{e^i}{2i}$.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the residue at $z = -i$\nSimilarly, $\\text{Res}(f, -i) = \\lim_{z \\to -i} (z + i)\\frac{e^z}{(z + i)(z - i)} = \\lim_{z \\to -i} \\frac{e^z}{z - i} = \\frac{e^{-i}}{-2i}$.\n\n## Step 10: Sum the residues and apply the Residue Theorem\n$\\sum \\text{Res} = \\frac{e^i}{2i} - \\frac{e^{-i}}{2i} = \\frac{e^i - e^{-i}}{2i} = \\sin(1)$, because $e^i - e^{-i} = 2i\\sin(1)$.\n\n## Step 11: Calculate the integral\n$\\oint_{|z|=2} \\frac{e^z}{z^2 + 1} dz = 2\\pi i \\sin(1)$.\n\n## Step 12: Write the final answer in the required format\n\nEvaluate the integral $\\oint_{|z|=2} \\frac{e^z}{z^2 + 1} dz$, where the contour $|z| = 2$ is traversed in the positive direction.",

    "question": "## Step 1: Understand the task and the domain\nThe task is to generate a challenging but solvable mathematics problem in the domain of Potential theory, along with a complete and verifiable solution. Potential theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of potentials and their properties, particularly in relation to partial differential equations, especially Laplace's equation.\n\n## Step 2: Identify key concepts in Potential theory\nPotential theory involves the study of harmonic functions, potentials (such as Newtonian or logarithmic potentials), and their applications. Key concepts include the Laplace equation ($\\Delta u = 0$), Poisson's equation ($\\Delta u = f$), and boundary value problems (Dirichlet and Neumann problems).\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a problem\nTo create a challenging problem, we need to involve some of the advanced concepts or techniques from Potential theory. Let's consider a problem involving the Dirichlet problem for the Laplace equation on a specific domain.\n\n## Step 4: Specify the problem\nLet's consider the following problem: \"Let $D = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2: |x| < 1\\}$ be the unit disk in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Find the solution $u(x)$ to the Dirichlet problem $\\Delta u = 0$ in $D$, $u(x) = \\log|x - (1,0)|$ on $\\partial D$.\"\n\n## Step 5: Provide the solution\nTo solve this problem, we can use the Poisson integral formula, which gives the solution to the Dirichlet problem on the unit disk. The Poisson integral formula is given by $u(x) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{\\partial D} \\frac{1 - |x|^2}{|x - y|^2} f(y) ds(y)$, where $f(y)$ is the boundary data.\n\n## Step 6: Apply the Poisson integral formula\nFor $x = (r\\cos\\theta, r\\sin\\theta)$ and $y = (\\cos\\phi, \\sin\\phi)$, we have $|x - y|^2 = r^2 - 2r\\cos(\\theta - \\phi) + 1$ and $ds(y) = d\\phi$. The boundary data is $f(y) = \\log|y - (1,0)| = \\log\\sqrt{2 - 2\\cos\\phi}$. So, $u(x) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{1 - r^2}{r^2 - 2r\\cos(\\theta - \\phi) + 1} \\log\\sqrt{2 - 2\\cos\\phi} d\\phi$.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the integral\nThe integral can be simplified by recognizing that $\\log\\sqrt{2 - 2\\cos\\phi} = \\log|1 - e^{i\\phi}| = \\log|1 - e^{i\\phi}| = \\Re(\\log(1 - e^{i\\phi}))$. However, directly evaluating this integral is complex and typically involves recognizing it as a special case that can be related to the properties of harmonic functions and the Poisson kernel.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluate the solution using properties of harmonic functions\nFor $x \\in D$, the solution can be found by directly applying properties of harmonic functions and recognizing that the given boundary condition corresponds to a specific harmonic function. The function $u(x) = \\log|x - (1,0)|$ is harmonic in $D$ except at $x = (1,0)$, which is outside $D$ since $|1,0| = 1$ is on $\\partial D$. Thus, we directly check if $u(x)$ satisfies the given boundary condition and is harmonic.\n\n## Step 9: Check if the given boundary data directly provides the solution\nSince $\\log|x - (1,0)|$ is harmonic in $D$ and equals $\\log|y - (1,0)|$ on $\\partial D$, it is the solution to the Dirichlet problem.\n\nThe final answer is: \n\nLet $D = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2: |x| < 1\\}$ be the unit disk in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Find the solution $u(x)$ to the Dirichlet problem $\\Delta u = 0$ in $D$, $u(x) = \\log|x - (1,0)|$ on $\\partial D$.",

    "question": "## Step 1: Understand the task and the domain\nThe task is to generate a challenging but solvable mathematics problem in the domain of \"Several complex variables and analytic spaces\" along with a complete and verifiable solution. The problem should be well-posed, clear, non-trivial, and solvable with established mathematical methods.\n\n## Step 2: Identify key concepts in the domain\nSeveral complex variables and analytic spaces involve the study of functions of multiple complex variables and the spaces on which these functions are defined. Key concepts include holomorphic functions, complex manifolds, analytic continuation, and various types of domains (e.g., domains of holomorphy, pseudoconvex domains).\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a problem\nTo create a problem, we need to focus on a specific aspect of several complex variables. Let's consider the concept of holomorphic functions on a domain in $\\mathbb{C}^n$. A potential problem could involve characterizing or analyzing the properties of such functions.\n\n## Step 4: Specify the problem\nLet's formulate a problem related to the extension of holomorphic functions. A well-known result in several complex variables is the Hartogs' extension theorem, which states that any holomorphic function defined on a domain in $\\mathbb{C}^n$ ($n > 1$) with a compact hole can be extended holomorphically to the whole domain. We can create a problem related to this concept.\n\n## Step 5: Create the problem statement\nConsider the domain $\\Omega = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}^2 : |z_1| < 1, |z_2| < 1\\}$ and the subset $S = \\{z \\in \\Omega : |z_1| < \\frac{1}{2}\\}$. Let $f$ be a holomorphic function on $\\Omega \\setminus S$. Show that $f$ can be extended to a holomorphic function on $\\Omega$.\n\n## Step 6: Provide the solution\nTo solve this, we recognize that $\\Omega \\setminus S$ is not a compact hole in $\\Omega$, so we cannot directly apply Hartogs' theorem. However, we can analyze the problem by considering the properties of holomorphic functions in $\\mathbb{C}^2$ and the specific geometry of $\\Omega$ and $S$.\n\n## Step 7: Detail the solution\nFor $z = (z_1, z_2) \\in \\Omega \\setminus S$, $f(z)$ is holomorphic. We need to show that $f$ can be extended holomorphically to $\\Omega$. For any fixed $z_2$ with $|z_2| < 1$, $f(z_1, z_2)$ is holomorphic in $z_1$ for $\\frac{1}{2} \\leq |z_1| < 1$. By the principle of analytic continuation in one variable, if $f(z_1, z_2)$ is holomorphic for $|z_1| < 1$ except on a smaller disk, it can be extended.

    "question": "## Step 1: Understand the task\nThe task is to generate a challenging but solvable mathematics problem in the domain of dynamical systems and ergodic theory, along with a complete and verifiable solution.\n\n## Step 2: Identify key concepts in dynamical systems and ergodic theory\nDynamical systems involve the study of the behavior of systems that change over time according to certain rules. Ergodic theory is a branch of mathematics that studies the behavior of dynamical systems over time, focusing on their statistical properties. Key concepts include ergodicity, measure-preserving transformations, and the ergodic theorem.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a problem\nTo create a problem, we need to incorporate concepts from dynamical systems and ergodic theory. A potential problem could involve analyzing the behavior of a specific dynamical system, such as determining if it is ergodic or calculating its invariant measures.\n\n## Step 4: Specify the problem\nLet's consider a simple yet challenging example: the rotation map on the unit circle. The unit circle can be represented as $\\mathbb{T} = \\mathbb{R}/\\mathbb{Z}$, and a rotation map $T: \\mathbb{T} \\to \\mathbb{T}$ is defined by $T(x) = x + \\alpha \\mod 1$, where $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n## Step 5: Formulate the question\nWe can ask whether the rotation map $T$ is ergodic with respect to the Lebesgue measure on $\\mathbb{T}$ when $\\alpha$ is irrational.\n\n## Step 6: Write the problem statement\n\"Let $T: \\mathbb{T} \\to \\mathbb{T}$ be defined by $T(x) = x + \\alpha \\mod 1$, where $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is irrational. Prove that $T$ is ergodic with respect to the Lebesgue measure on $\\mathbb{T}$.\"\n\n## Step 7: Provide the solution\nTo prove that $T$ is ergodic, we need to show that if $A \\subset \\mathbb{T}$ is $T$-invariant (i.e., $T(A) = A$) and measurable, then either $m(A) = 0$ or $m(A) = 1$, where $m$ denotes the Lebesgue measure.\n\n## Step 8: Detail the solution\nFirst, recall that $T$ is measure-preserving because $m(T^{-1}(A)) = m(A)$ for any measurable $A \\subset \\mathbb{T}$. For $T$ to be ergodic, we must show that $T$-invariant sets have measure 0 or 1.\n\n## Step 9: Use Fourier analysis to prove ergodicity\nConsider a $T$-invariant set $A$. The characteristic function $\\chi_A$ of $A$ is $T$-invariant, meaning $\\chi_A(T(x)) = \\chi_A(x)$. We can expand $\\chi_A$ in a Fourier series: $\\chi_A(x) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} c_n e^{2\\pi inx}$, where $c_n = \\int_{\\mathbb{T}} \\chi_A(x)e^{-2\\pi inx} dx$.\n\n## Step 10: Apply $T$-invariance to the Fourier series\nSince $\\chi_A(T(x)) = \\chi_A(x + \\alpha) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} c_n e^{2\\pi in(x + \\alpha)} = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} c_n e^{2\\pi in\\alpha}e^{2\\pi inx}$, and this equals $\\chi_A(x)$, we have $c_n = c_n e^{2\\pi in\\alpha}$ for all $n$. For $\\alpha$ irrational, $e^{2\\pi in\\alpha} \\neq 1$ unless $n = 0$. Thus, $c_n = 0$ for $n \\neq 0$.\n\n## Step 11: Conclude ergodicity from the Fourier analysis\nThis implies $\\chi_A(x) = c_0 = \\int_{\\mathbb{T}} \\chi_A(x) dx = m(A)$, meaning $\\chi_A$ is constant. Hence, $A$ is either $\\mathbb{T}$ (if $m(A) = 1$) or $\\emptyset$ (if $m(A) = 0$), proving $T$ is ergodic.\n\n## Step 12: Format the question and answer according to the required structure\n\nLet $T: \\mathbb{T} \\to \\mathbb{T}$ be defined by $T(x) = x + \\alpha \\mod 1$, where $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is irrational. Prove that $T$ is ergodic with respect to the Lebesgue measure on $\\mathbb{T}$.",

It should be fully specified, with clear notation and constraints.\n\n## Step 3: Generate a problem\nLet's generate a problem: \"Find all functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the functional equation $f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) + xy$ for all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$, and $f(1) = 1$.\"\n\n## Step 4: Verify that the generated problem meets the quality rubric\n- **Well-Posedness and Completeness**: The problem is fully self-contained, with the domain and codomain of $f$ specified, and the functional equation given.\n- **Clarity**: The notation is standard, and the task is clear.\n- **Non-Triviality**: The problem requires solving a functional equation, which is non-trivial.\n- **Solvability and Verification**: The problem is solvable using established methods for functional equations.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the generated problem\nTo solve $f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) + xy$, let's first try substituting specific values for $x$ and $y$ to derive additional information.\n\n## Step 6: Substitute $x = y = 0$ into the equation\n$f(0 + 0) = f(0) + f(0) + 0 \\cdot 0$ simplifies to $f(0) = 2f(0)$, which implies $f(0) = 0$.\n\n## Step 7: Substitute $y = 1$ into the original equation\n$f(x + 1) = f(x) + f(1) + x = f(x) + x + 1$, since $f(1) = 1$.

The problem should be well-posed, clear, non-trivial, and solvable with established mathematical methods.\n\n## Step 2: Choose a specific topic within the domain\nLet's focus on the Laplace transform, a key concept within integral transforms and operational calculus. The Laplace transform is defined as $\\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st}f(t)dt = F(s)$, where $f(t)$ is a function defined for $t \\geq 0$.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a challenging problem\nTo create a challenging problem, we can consider applying the Laplace transform to solve a differential equation, as this involves understanding both the transform and its inverse. A suitable problem could involve solving an initial value problem (IVP) using the Laplace transform.\n\n## Step 4: Specify the problem\nLet's consider the following IVP: $y'' + 4y = \\sin(2t)$, with initial conditions $y(0) = 0$ and $y'(0) = 0$. The task is to solve for $y(t)$ using the Laplace transform.\n\n## Step 5: Write the problem statement\n\nUse the Laplace transform to solve the initial value problem $y'' + 4y = \\sin(2t)$, where $y(0) = 0$ and $y'(0) = 0$.\n\n## Step 6: Provide the solution\nTo solve the given IVP using the Laplace transform, we first apply the Laplace transform to both sides of the differential equation.\n\n## Step 7: Apply the Laplace transform to the differential equation\n$\\mathcal{L}\\{y'' + 4y\\} = \\mathcal{L}\\{\\sin(2t)\\}$. Using linearity, we get $\\mathcal{L}\\{y''\\} + 4\\mathcal{L}\\{y\\} = \\mathcal{L}\\{\\sin(2t)\\}$.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluate the Laplace transforms\n$\\mathcal{L}\\{y''\\} = s^2Y(s) - sy(0) - y'(0)$ and $\\mathcal{L}\\{y\\} = Y(s)$, where $Y(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{y(t)\\}$. Given $y(0) = 0$ and $y'(0) = 0$, $\\mathcal{L}\\{y''\\} = s^2Y(s)$. $\\mathcal{L}\\{\\sin(2t)\\} = \\frac{2}{s^2 + 4}$.\n\n## Step 9: Substitute the known values and simplify\n$s^2Y(s) + 4Y(s) = \\frac{2}{s^2 + 4}$. Thus, $Y(s)(s^2 + 4) = \\frac{2}{s^2 + 4}$, which simplifies to $Y(s) = \\frac{2}{(s^2 + 4)^2}$.\n\n## Step 10: Find the inverse Laplace transform of $Y(s)$\nTo find $y(t)$, we need $\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{Y(s)\\} = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{2}{(s^2 + 4)^2}\\right\\}$. Recall that $\\mathcal{L}\\{\\sin(at)\\} = \\frac{a}{s^2 + a^2}$, and use the property that $\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{F(s)\\} = f(t)$ implies $\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{d}{ds}F(s)\\right\\} = -tf(t)$, or more directly, utilize the convolution or known transforms.\n\n## Step 11: Evaluate the inverse Laplace transform\nUsing the formula for $\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{2a^3}{(s^2 + a^2)^2}\\right\\} = \\sin(at) - at\\cos(at)$ with $a = 2$, we adjust for our case: $\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{2}{(s^2 + 4)^2}\\right\\} = \\frac{1}{4}\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{2 \\cdot 2^3}{(s^2 + 2^2)^2}\\right\\} = \\frac{1}{4}(\\sin(2t) - 2t\\cos(2t))$.\n\n## Step 12: Write the complete solution",

    "question": "## Step 1: Understand the task\nThe task is to generate a challenging but solvable mathematics problem in the domain of Geometry, along with a complete and verifiable solution. The problem must be well-posed, clear, non-trivial, and solvable with established mathematical methods.\n\n## Step 2: Choose a geometry topic\nTo create a challenging problem, we need to select a topic within geometry that is rich enough to allow for a non-trivial question. Let's consider problems related to geometric shapes, such as triangles, circles, or more complex figures.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a problem\nLet's formulate a problem involving a triangle and a circle, as these are fundamental geometric objects. A potential problem could involve the properties of inscribed angles, the relationship between a triangle and its circumcircle, or the application of geometric theorems like Ptolemy's theorem.\n\n## Step 4: Create a specific problem\nConsider the following problem: \"Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $AB = 5$, $AC = 6$, and $BC = 7$. The circumcircle of triangle $ABC$ has center $O$. Let $D$ be the point on $BC$ such that $AD$ is the angle bisector of $\\angle BAC$. Find the length of $AD$.\"\n\n## Step 5: Verify the problem meets the criteria\n- **Well-Posedness and Completeness**: The triangle $ABC$ is well-defined by its side lengths (5, 6, 7), and $D$ is defined as the point on $BC$ where $AD$ bisects $\\angle BAC$. The circumcircle and its center $O$ are also well-defined.\n- **Clarity**: The problem statement is clear and unambiguous.\n- **Non-Triviality**: The problem requires applying geometric principles, such as the Angle Bisector Theorem and possibly properties of the circumcircle.\n- **Solvability and Verification**: The problem is solvable using established geometric methods.\n\n## Step 6: Solve the problem\nTo solve this, we can use the Angle Bisector Theorem to find $BD$ and $DC$, and then apply the Stewart's Theorem to find $AD$.\n\n### Step 6.1: Apply the Angle Bisector Theorem\nThe Angle Bisector Theorem states that $\\frac{BD}{DC} = \\frac{AB}{AC}$. So, $\\frac{BD}{DC} = \\frac{5}{6}$.\n\n### Step 6.2: Calculate $BD$ and $DC$\nGiven $BC = 7$, we have $BD + DC = 7$. From the Angle Bisector Theorem, we can write $BD = \\frac{5}{11} \\times 7$ and $DC = \\frac{6}{11} \\times 7$. Thus, $BD = \\frac{35}{11}$ and $DC = \\frac{42}{11}$.\n\n### Step 6.3: Apply Stewart's Theorem to find $AD$\nStewart's Theorem states that $b^2n + c^2m = a(d^2 + m*n)$, where $a = BC = 7$, $b = AC = 6$, $c = AB = 5$, $d = AD$, $m = BD = \\frac{35}{11}$, and $n = DC = \\frac{42}{11}$. Substituting these values gives us an equation to solve for $d = AD$.\n\n## Step 7: Perform Stewart's Theorem calculation\nLet's substitute the given values into Stewart's Theorem:\n$6^2(\\frac{35}{11}) + 5^2(\\frac{42}{11}) = 7(AD^2 + \\frac{35}{11}*\\frac{42}{11})$.\nSimplifying yields:\n$36(\\frac{35}{11}) + 25(\\frac{42}{11}) = 7(AD^2 + \\frac{1470}{121})$.\nThis simplifies to:\n$\\frac{1260}{11} + \\frac{1050}{11} = 7AD^2 + \\frac{7*1470}{121}$.\nFurther simplification gives:\n$\\frac{2310}{11} = 7AD^2 + \\frac{10290}{121}$.\nConverting to a common denominator:\n$\\frac{2310*11}{121} = 7AD^2 + \\frac{10290}{121}$,\n$\\frac{25410}{121} = 7AD^2 + \\frac{10290}{121}$.\nSimplifying:\n$7AD^2 = \\frac{25410 - 10290}{121}$,\n$7AD^2 = \\frac{15120}{121}$,\n$AD^2 = \\frac{15120}{7*121}$,\n$AD^2 = \\frac{2160}{121}$,\n$AD = \\sqrt{\\frac{2160}{121}}$.\n\n## Step 8: Simplify $AD$\n$AD = \\sqrt{\\frac{2160}{121}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{16*135}{121}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{16*9*15}{121}} = \\frac{4*3}{11}\\sqrt{15} = \\frac{12\\sqrt{15}}{11}$.\n\nThe final answer is: \n\nLet $ABC$ be a triangle with $AB = 5$, $AC = 6$, and $BC = 7$. The circumcircle of triangle $ABC$ has center $O$. Let $D$ be the point on $BC$ such that $AD$ is the angle bisector of $\\angle BAC$. Find the length of $AD$.",

The problem should be well-posed, clear, non-trivial, and solvable with established mathematical methods.\n\n## Step 2: Identify a suitable topic within differential geometry\nDifferential geometry is a broad field that includes the study of curves and surfaces, Riemannian geometry, and more. A suitable topic could involve the properties of curves or surfaces, such as curvature, geodesics, or the application of differential geometry to other areas like physics.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a specific problem\nLet's consider a problem involving the curvature of a surface. A classic result in differential geometry is the Theorema Egregium of Gauss, which states that the Gaussian curvature of a surface is invariant under isometric deformations. A challenging problem could involve calculating or utilizing this curvature.\n\n## Step 4: Construct the problem statement\nTo create a problem, let's consider a specific surface and ask a question about its geometric properties. For example, we could examine the surface given by $z = x^2 + y^2$ and ask to compute its Gaussian curvature at a given point.\n\n## Step 5: Write the problem statement\nLet's define the problem: \"Let $S$ be the surface given by $z = x^2 + y^2$. Compute the Gaussian curvature $K$ of $S$ at the point $(1,1,2)$.\"\n\n## Step 6: Provide the solution\nTo solve this, we first need to parameterize the surface. The surface $S$ can be parameterized by $\\vec{r}(x,y) = (x, y, x^2 + y^2)$. The Gaussian curvature $K$ can be found using the formula $K = \\frac{LN - M^2}{EG - F^2}$, where $E, F, G$ are coefficients of the first fundamental form, and $L, M, N$ are coefficients of the second fundamental form.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the first and second fundamental forms\nFirst, compute $\\vec{r}_x = (1, 0, 2x)$ and $\\vec{r}_y = (0, 1, 2y)$. Then, $E = \\vec{r}_x \\cdot \\vec{r}_x = 1 + 4x^2$, $F = \\vec{r}_x \\cdot \\vec{r}_y = 4xy$, and $G = \\vec{r}_y \\cdot \\vec{r}_y = 1 + 4y^2$. The normal vector $\\vec{n} = \\frac{\\vec{r}_x \\times \\vec{r}_y}{\\|\\vec{r}_x \\times \\vec{r}_y\\|}$, and $\\vec{r}_x \\times \\vec{r}_y = (-2x, -2y, 1)$, so $\\|\\vec{r}_x \\times \\vec{r}_y\\| = \\sqrt{4x^2 + 4y^2 + 1}$. Thus, $\\vec{n} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4x^2 + 4y^2 + 1}}(-2x, -2y, 1)$.\n\n## Step 8: Continue with the calculation of $L, M, N$\n$L = \\vec{r}_{xx} \\cdot \\vec{n}$, $M = \\vec{r}_{xy} \\cdot \\vec{n}$, and $N = \\vec{r}_{yy} \\cdot \\vec{n}$. We have $\\vec{r}_{xx} = (0, 0, 2)$, $\\vec{r}_{xy} = (0, 0, 0)$, and $\\vec{r}_{yy} = (0, 0, 2)$. So, $L = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{4x^2 + 4y^2 + 1}}$, $M = 0$, and $N = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{4x^2 + 4y^2 + 1}}$.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate $K$ at $(1,1,2)$\nAt $(1,1,2)$, $x = 1$, $y = 1$, so $E = 5$, $F = 4$, $G = 5$, $L = \\frac{2}{3}$, $M = 0$, and $N = \\frac{2}{3}$. Thus, $EG - F^2 = 25 - 16 = 9$ and $LN - M^2 = \\frac{4}{9}$.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate $K$\n$K = \\frac{LN - M^2}{EG - F^2} = \\frac{\\frac{4}{9}}{9} = \\frac{4}{81}$.\n\nThe final answer is: \n\nLet $S$ be the surface given by $z = x^2 + y^2$. Compute the Gaussian curvature $K$ of $S$ at the point $(1,1,2)$.",

Since $R$ is closed, the intersection\n$$\nK \\;:=\\; R\\cap (X\\times C)\n$$\nis closed in $X\\times X$, hence compact because $X\\times X$ is compact (product of compact spaces).\n\nLet $\\pi_1:X\\times X\\to X$ be the first projection.

Indeed:\n- If $x\\in \\pi_1(K)$, then $\\exists y\\in C$ with $(x,y)\\in R$, i.e. $x\\sim y$ with $y\\in C$, so $x\\in \\operatorname{Sat}(C)$.\n- If $x\\in \\operatorname{Sat}(C)$, then $\\exists y\\in C$ with $x\\sim y$, so $(x,y)\\in R\\cap (X\\times C)=K$, hence $x\\in\\pi_1(K)$.\n\nThus $\\operatorname{Sat}(C)=\\pi_1(K)$ is closed. \u220e\n\n**Corollary.** Every equivalence class $[x]=\\operatorname{Sat}(\\{x\\})$ is closed in $X$ (since $\\{x\\}$ is closed in a Hausdorff space).\n\n---\n\n#### Step 3: $Y$ is Hausdorff\n\nTake two distinct points $y_1\\neq y_2$ in $Y$.

Define\n$$\nU := X\\setminus \\operatorname{Sat}(X\\setminus U_0),\\qquad\nV := X\\setminus \\operatorname{Sat}(X\\setminus V_0).\n$$\n- Since $X\\setminus U_0$ is closed, the lemma gives that $\\operatorname{Sat}(X\\setminus U_0)$ is closed, so $U$ is open. Similarly $V$ is open.\n- $\\operatorname{Sat}(X\\setminus U_0)$ is a union of equivalence classes, hence its complement $U$ is also a union of equivalence classes; equivalently, $U$ is **saturated**. Same for $V$.\n- Because $A\\subseteq U_0$, the class $A$ does not meet $X\\setminus U_0$, so $A\\cap \\operatorname{Sat}(X\\setminus U_0)=\\varnothing$, hence $A\\subseteq U$. Similarly $B\\subseteq V$.\n- Also $U\\subseteq U_0$ and $V\\subseteq V_0$ (since $\\operatorname{Sat}(X\\setminus U_0)\\supseteq X\\setminus U_0$), so $U\\cap V=\\varnothing$.\n\nSince $U$ is saturated and open in $X$, its image $q(U)$ is open in $Y$: indeed,\n$$\nq^{-1}(q(U))=\\operatorname{Sat}(U)=U\n$$\nand $U$ is open, so by the definition of the quotient topology $q(U)$ is open. Likewise, $q(V)$ is open.\n\nFinally, $y_1\\in q(U)$ (because $A\\subseteq U$) and $y_2\\in q(V)$, and\n$$\nq(U)\\cap q(V)=\\varnothing\n$$\nbecause $U\\cap V=\\varnothing$ and $U,V$ are saturated (if an equivalence class met both, then $U\\cap V$ would be nonempty).\n\nThus $y_1,y_2$ have disjoint open neighborhoods, so $Y$ is Hausdorff.\n\nCombining with compactness, $Y$ is **compact Hausdorff**. \u220e\n\n---\n\n### Part 2.

It is a standard theorem from the classification of surfaces (or can be checked directly from the local structure of the quotient) that the resulting quotient space is a closed orientable surface of genus $g$, hence homeomorphic to $M$.\n\nThis quotient description induces a CW structure as follows:\n\n- The interior of $P$ becomes a single 2-cell $e^2$.\n- The boundary of $P$ consists of $4g$ edges, identified in pairs, so it yields $2g$ distinct 1-cells $e^1_{a_1},e^1_{b_1},\\dots,e^1_{a_g},e^1_{b_g}$.\n- All $4g$ vertices of $P$ are identified to a single point in the quotient (this follows from the cyclic edge identifications: traversing the boundary word identifies endpoints successively, producing one equivalence class of vertices). Hence there is exactly one 0-cell $e^0$.\n\nTherefore $M$ admits a finite CW decomposition with:\n$$\nc_0=1,\\qquad c_1=2g,\\qquad c_2=1,\n$$\nand no higher-dimensional cells.\n\n### 2) Compute the Euler characteristic\nFor a finite CW complex, the Euler characteristic is the alternating sum of the numbers of cells:\n$$\n\\chi(M)=\\sum_{k\\ge 0} (-1)^k c_k = c_0 - c_1 + c_2.\n$$\nSubstituting the cell counts above gives\n$$\n\\chi(M)=1-(2g)+1=2-2g.\n$$\n\n### 3) Edge case $g=0$\nWhen $g=0$, $M\\cong S^2$.

It is a standard theorem from the classification of surfaces (or can be checked directly from the local structure of the quotient) that the resulting quotient space is a closed orientable surface of genus \\(g\\), hence homeomorphic to \\(M\\).\n\nThis quotient description induces a CW structure as follows:\n\n- The interior of \\(P\\) becomes a single 2-cell \\(e^2\\).\n- The boundary of \\(P\\) consists of \\(4g\\) edges, identified in pairs, so it yields \\(2g\\) distinct 1-cells \\(e^1_{a_1},e^1_{b_1},\\dots,e^1_{a_g},e^1_{b_g}\\).\n- All \\(4g\\) vertices of \\(P\\) are identified to a single point in the quotient (this follows from the cyclic edge identifications: traversing the boundary word identifies endpoints successively, producing one equivalence class of vertices). Hence there is exactly one 0-cell \\(e^0\\).\n\nTherefore \\(M\\) admits a finite CW decomposition with:\n\\[\nc_0=1,\\qquad c_1=2g,\\qquad c_2=1,\n\\]\nand no higher-dimensional cells.\n\n### 2) Compute the Euler characteristic\nFor a finite CW complex, the Euler characteristic is the alternating sum of the numbers of cells:\n\\[\n\\chi(M)=\\sum_{k\\ge 0} (-1)^k c_k = c_0 - c_1 + c_2.\n\\]\nSubstituting the cell counts above gives\n\\[\n\\chi(M)=1-(2g)+1=2-2g.\n\\]\n\n### 3) Edge case \\(g=0\\)\nWhen \\(g=0\\), \\(M\\cong S^2\\). The above formula yields \\(\\chi(S^2)=2\\), consistent with the usual CW structure on \\(S^2\\) having one 0-cell and one 2-cell.\n\n### Conclusion\nFor a closed orientable surface \\(M\\) of genus \\(g\\),\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\chi(M)=2-2g.}\n\\]",

    "question": "## Step 1: Understand the task and the domain\nThe task is to generate a challenging but solvable mathematics problem in the domain of \"Global analysis, analysis on manifolds\" along with a complete and verifiable solution. The problem should be well-posed, clear, non-trivial, and solvable with established mathematical methods.\n\n## Step 2: Identify key concepts in the domain\nGlobal analysis and analysis on manifolds involve the study of geometric and topological properties of manifolds using analytical techniques. Key concepts include differential forms, integration on manifolds, Stokes' theorem, and the study of differential equations on manifolds.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a problem\nTo create a problem, we need to identify a specific concept or technique within global analysis or analysis on manifolds that can be used to formulate a challenging yet solvable question. One such concept is the application of Stokes' theorem, which relates the integral of a differential form over a manifold to the integral of its exterior derivative over the boundary of the manifold.\n\n## Step 4: Construct the problem\nLet's consider a specific manifold and a differential form. A common example is the unit sphere $S^2$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. We can formulate a problem involving the integration of a differential form over $S^2$ and applying Stokes' theorem.\n\n## Step 5: Specify the problem\nLet $\\omega = y \\, dx \\wedge dz$ be a 2-form on $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Consider the unit sphere $S^2 = \\{ (x, y, z) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 : x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1 \\}$ oriented with the outward unit normal. Evaluate $\\int_{S^2} \\omega$.\n\n## Step 6: Provide the solution\nTo solve this, we can directly integrate $\\omega$ over $S^2$ or apply Stokes' theorem. Stokes' theorem states that $\\int_M d\\omega = \\int_{\\partial M} \\omega$, where $M$ is a manifold with boundary $\\partial M$. Here, we can consider $M = B^3 = \\{ (x, y, z) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 : x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\leq 1 \\}$, so $\\partial M = S^2$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate $d\\omega$\n$d\\omega = d(y \\, dx \\wedge dz) = dy \\wedge dx \\wedge dz = -dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz$ because $d(y) = dy$, $d(dx) = 0$, and $d(dz) = 0$. So, $d\\omega = -dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz$.\n\n## Step 8: Apply Stokes' theorem\n$\\int_{S^2} \\omega = \\int_{B^3} d\\omega = \\int_{B^3} -dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz = -\\int_{B^3} dV$, where $dV = dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz$ is the volume form on $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Thus, $\\int_{S^2} \\omega = -\\text{Vol}(B^3)$.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the volume of $B^3$\nThe volume of the unit ball $B^3$ is given by $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(1)^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi$.\n\n## Step 10: Conclude the solution\n$\\int_{S^2} \\omega = -\\frac{4}{3}\\pi$.\n\nThe final answer is: \n\nLet $\\omega = y \\, dx \\wedge dz$ be a 2-form on $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Consider the unit sphere $S^2 = \\{ (x, y, z) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 : x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1 \\}$ oriented with the outward unit normal. Evaluate $\\int_{S^2} \\omega$.",

    "question": "## Step 1: Understand the task and the requirements for the problem.\nThe task is to generate a challenging but solvable mathematics problem in the domain of number theory, along with a complete and verifiable solution. The problem must be well-posed, clear, non-trivial, and solvable with established mathematical methods.\n\n## Step 2: Identify a suitable topic within number theory.\nNumber theory encompasses various topics such as divisibility, prime numbers, congruences, and Diophantine equations. A challenging problem could involve proving a property related to prime numbers or solving a specific type of Diophantine equation.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a problem that meets the criteria.\nLet's consider a problem involving the characterization of even perfect numbers and their relation to Mersenne primes.\n\n## Step 4: Specify the problem.\nConsider the following problem: \"Prove that if $n$ is an even perfect number, then $n = 2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$, where $2^p - 1$ is a Mersenne prime.\"\n\n## Step 5: Provide the solution to the problem.\nTo solve this, we need to understand the definition of an even perfect number and its relation to Mersenne primes. The Euclid-Euler theorem states that every even perfect number is of the form $2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$, where $2^p - 1$ is a Mersenne prime.\n\n## Step 6: Outline the proof.\nFirst, we show that any number of the form $2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$, where $2^p - 1$ is prime, is perfect. Then, we outline that every even perfect number is of this form.\n\n## Step 7: Prove that $2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$ is perfect when $2^p - 1$ is prime.\nLet $n = 2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$. The sum of divisors of $n$, $\\sigma(n)$, is given by $\\sigma(n) = \\sigma(2^{p-1})\\sigma(2^p - 1)$. Since $2^p - 1$ is prime, $\\sigma(2^p - 1) = 2^p$. Also, $\\sigma(2^{p-1}) = 1 + 2 + 2^2 + \\cdots + 2^{p-1} = 2^p - 1$. Thus, $\\sigma(n) = (2^p - 1) \\cdot 2^p = 2 \\cdot 2^{p-1}(2^p - 1) = 2n$, proving $n$ is perfect.\n\n## Step 8: Outline the proof that every even perfect number is of the form $2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$.\nLet $n$ be an even perfect number. Then $n = 2^k \\cdot m$, where $m$ is odd. Since $n$ is perfect, $\\sigma(n) = 2n$. Using the multiplicative property of $\\sigma$, we have $\\sigma(n) = \\sigma(2^k)\\sigma(m) = (2^{k+1} - 1)\\sigma(m)$. Thus, $(2^{k+1} - 1)\\sigma(m) = 2^{k+1}m$. This implies $2^{k+1} - 1$ divides $m$, so $m = (2^{k+1} - 1)d$ for some $d$. Substituting back gives $\\sigma(m) = 2^{k+1}d$. For $d = 1$, $m = 2^{k+1} - 1$ is prime, and $\\sigma(m) = m + 1 = 2^{k+1}$, which matches our requirement.\n\n## Step 9: Conclude the solution.\nThe given statement is a direct consequence of the Euclid-Euler theorem.\n\n\nProve that if $n$ is an even perfect number, then $n = 2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$, where $2^p - 1$ is a Mersenne prime.",

    "question": "## Step 1: Understand the task and the given topic\nThe task is to generate a challenging but solvable mathematics problem in the domain of \"Field theory and polynomials\" along with a complete and verifiable solution. The problem should be simpler than the given previous attempt but still challenging.\n\n## Step 2: Review the previous attempt to understand the level of complexity and topic\nThe previous attempt involves proving a condition about the Galois group of a cubic polynomial being isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ based on its irreducibility and the discriminant being a square in the field $F$. This involves advanced concepts like Galois groups and discriminants.\n\n## Step 3: Determine a simpler problem within the same domain\nTo create a simpler problem, we can focus on a more basic aspect of field theory and polynomials, such as the properties of polynomials over a field, roots of polynomials, or basic field extensions.\n\n## Step 4: Formulate a problem\nLet's consider a problem that involves determining whether a given polynomial is irreducible over a specific field. This is a fundamental concept in field theory and polynomials.\n\n## Step 5: Specify the problem\nConsider the polynomial $p(x) = x^4 + 1$ over the field $\\mathbb{Q}$ of rational numbers. The task is to determine whether $p(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n## Step 6: Provide a solution to the problem\nTo determine if $p(x) = x^4 + 1$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, we can attempt to factor it or use a relevant irreducibility test.\n\n## Step 7: Apply the irreducibility test\nOne relevant test is Eisenstein's criterion, but it doesn't directly apply here because there's no prime $p$ such that $p$ divides all terms except $x^4$ and $p^2$ does not divide the constant term. However, we can examine if $x^4 + 1$ can be factored into smaller polynomials over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n## Step 8: Examine factorization\nNotice that $x^4 + 1$ can be factored using the difference of squares if we manipulate it appropriately: $x^4 + 1 = (x^2 + \\sqrt{2}x + 1)(x^2 - \\sqrt{2}x + 1)$. However, this factorization involves $\\sqrt{2}$, which is not in $\\mathbb{Q}$, suggesting we should look for factorizations over $\\mathbb{Q}$ directly.\n\n## Step 9: Check for roots\nFirst, check if $p(x)$ has any roots in $\\mathbb{Q}$ by using the Rational Root Theorem, which states that any rational root, in its most reduced form, is of the form $\\pm \\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ is a factor of the constant term and $q$ is a factor of the leading coefficient. For $x^4 + 1 = 0$, the constant term is 1, so possible rational roots are $\\pm 1$. Since $p(1) = 2$ and $p(-1) = 2$, $p(x)$ has no rational roots.\n\n## Step 10: Consider factorization into quadratic factors\nTo check if $x^4 + 1$ is irreducible, we also need to verify it cannot be factored into two quadratic polynomials over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Assume $x^4 + 1 = (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d)$, where $a, b, c, d \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. Expanding gives $x^4 + (a+c)x^3 + (ac + b + d)x^2 + (ad + bc)x + bd$. Matching coefficients yields a system of equations.\n\n## Step 11: Solve the system of equations for the coefficients\nMatching coefficients gives: $a + c = 0$, $ac + b + d = 0$, $ad + bc = 0$, and $bd = 1$. From $a + c = 0$, we get $c = -a$. Substituting into the other equations gives conditions that need to be satisfied for $a, b, d \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n## Step 12: Analyze the conditions for $a, b, d$\nSince $bd = 1$, $b = d = 1$ or $b = d = -1$ are the simplest solutions. For $b = d = 1$, we have $ac + 2 = 0$ and $a(-1 + 1) = 0$, simplifying to $-a^2 + 2 = 0$, or $a^2 = 2$, which has no solution in $\\mathbb{Q}$ because $\\sqrt{2} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}$. For $b = d = -1$, we get $-a^2 - 2 = 0$, or $a^2 = -2$, which also has no solution in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n## Step 13: Conclude on the irreducibility of $p(x)$\nSince $x^4 + 1$ has no linear factors (no rational roots) and cannot be factored into two quadratic factors over $\\mathbb{Q}$ (as shown by the lack of rational solutions for $a, b, c, d$), we conclude it is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThe final answer is: \n\nDetermine whether the polynomial $p(x) = x^4 + 1$ is irreducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}$ of rational numbers.",

    "question": "## Step 1: Understand the task and the domain\nThe task is to generate a challenging but solvable mathematics problem in the domain of algebraic geometry, along with a complete and verifiable solution. The problem should be well-posed, clear, non-trivial, and solvable with established mathematical methods.\n\n## Step 2: Identify a suitable topic within algebraic geometry\nAlgebraic geometry is a broad field that involves the study of geometric objects, such as varieties and schemes, using tools from abstract algebra. A suitable topic could involve the study of curves, surfaces, or higher-dimensional varieties, and their properties.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a specific problem\nLet's consider a problem involving the intersection of curves on a surface. A classic result in algebraic geometry is B\u00e9zout's theorem, which describes the intersection of two curves on a projective plane. We can formulate a problem related to this.\n\n## Step 4: State the problem\nConsider two curves $C_1$ and $C_2$ on $\\mathbb{P}^2$, defined by homogeneous polynomials $f(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 - z^2$ and $g(x,y,z) = xy - z^2$, respectively. Find the number of intersection points of $C_1$ and $C_2$ in $\\mathbb{P}^2$, counted with multiplicity.\n\n## Step 5: Provide the solution\nTo find the intersection points, we need to solve the system of equations given by $f(x,y,z) = 0$ and $g(x,y,z) = 0$. This means we have to solve $x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = 0$ and $xy - z^2 = 0$ simultaneously.\n\n## Step 6: Solve the system of equations using B\u00e9zout's theorem\nB\u00e9zout's theorem states that two curves of degrees $d_1$ and $d_2$ intersect in $d_1d_2$ points, counted with multiplicity, if they have no common components. Here, $C_1$ and $C_2$ are both of degree 2, so they should intersect in $2 \\times 2 = 4$ points.\n\n## Step 7: Verify if $C_1$ and $C_2$ have any common components\nTo check if $C_1$ and $C_2$ have common components, we need to see if $f$ and $g$ have a common factor. This involves checking if there's a non-constant polynomial that divides both $f$ and $g$.\n\n## Step 8: Check for common factors\nWe examine if there's a linear combination of $f$ and $g$ that simplifies to a constant or a factorable expression. However, given the nature of $f$ and $g$, and without loss of generality, we can directly apply B\u00e9zout's theorem if we confirm they don't share a component.\n\n## Step 9: Apply B\u00e9zout's theorem\nSince both $f$ and $g$ are of degree 2 and there's no immediate indication they share a factor (which would be a linear factor given their degree), we can conclude they intersect in 4 points counted with multiplicity.\n\n## Step 10: Conclude the number of intersection points\nBy B\u00e9zout's theorem, $C_1$ and $C_2$ intersect in 4 points.\n\nThe final answer is: \n\n\nConsider two curves $C_1$ and $C_2$ on $\\mathbb{P}^2$, defined by homogeneous polynomials $f(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 - z^2$ and $g(x,y,z) = xy - z^2$, respectively.

To get a nonzero $xy$-term, we need $ab'+ba'\\neq 0$, forcing at least one of $a,a'$ and one of $b,b'$ to be nonzero. But then $aa'$ and $bb'$ cannot both be $0$ unless (say) $a'=0$ and $b=0$ or similar, which kills the $xy$-term. A quick case check shows this is impossible.

Expanding gives\n\\[\n(ax+by+cz)(a'x+b'y+c'z)=aa'x^2+bb'y^2+(ab'+ba')xy + (\\text{terms in }xz,yz)+cc'z^2.\n\\]\nComparing with \\(xy-z^2\\), the coefficients of \\(x^2\\) and \\(y^2\\) must be \\(0\\), so \\(aa'=0\\) and \\(bb'=0\\). To get a nonzero \\(xy\\)-term, we need \\(ab'+ba'\\neq 0\\), forcing at least one of \\(a,a'\\) and one of \\(b,b'\\) to be nonzero. But then \\(aa'\\) and \\(bb'\\) cannot both be \\(0\\) unless (say) \\(a'=0\\) and \\(b=0\\) or similar, which kills the \\(xy\\)-term. A quick case check shows this is impossible. Hence \\(g\\) is irreducible, so no line divides \\(g\\), hence no common component exists.\n\nTherefore \\(C_1\\) and \\(C_2\\) have no common component.\n\n## 2) Apply B\u00e9zout\u2019s theorem\nBy B\u00e9zout\u2019s theorem for plane projective curves with no common component,\n\\[\n\\sum_{P\\in C_1\\cap C_2} I(P;C_1\\cdot C_2)=\\deg(C_1)\\deg(C_2)=2\\cdot 2=4.\n\\]\nSo the number of intersection points **counted with multiplicity** is \\(4\\).\n\n## 3) (Optional verification: the intersections are affine and generically simple)\nThere are no intersection points at infinity: if \\(z=0\\), then \\(g=xy=0\\) and \\(f=x^2+y^2=0\\).

    "question": "## Step 1: Understand the problem statement\nThe problem asks us to show that the matrices $H = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$, $X = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, and $Y = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ form a basis for the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{sl}(2, \\mathbb{R})$ of $2 \\times 2$ real matrices with trace zero, and to compute the structure constants with respect to this basis.\n\n## Step 2: Verify that $H, X, Y$ are in $\\mathfrak{sl}(2, \\mathbb{R})$\nTo be in $\\mathfrak{sl}(2, \\mathbb{R})$, a matrix must be a $2 \\times 2$ real matrix with trace zero. $H, X,$ and $Y$ are all $2 \\times 2$ real matrices. We check their traces: $\\text{tr}(H) = 1 - 1 = 0$, $\\text{tr}(X) = 0 + 0 = 0$, and $\\text{tr}(Y) = 0 + 0 = 0$. Thus, $H, X, Y \\in \\mathfrak{sl}(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n\n## Step 3: Show that $H, X, Y$ are linearly independent\nTo show that $H, X, Y$ are linearly independent, we need to prove that the equation $aH + bX + cY = 0$ implies $a = b = c = 0$. Substituting the matrices, we get:\n$a\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} + b\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + c\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThis gives $\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & -a \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. Thus, $a = 0$, $b = 0$, and $c = 0$, proving linear independence.\n\n## Step 4: Show that $H, X, Y$ span $\\mathfrak{sl}(2, \\mathbb{R})$\nAny matrix in $\\mathfrak{sl}(2, \\mathbb{R})$ is of the form $\\begin{pmatrix} x & y \\\\ z & -x \\end{pmatrix}$ where $x, y, z \\in \\mathbb{R}$. We can express this as $x\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} + y\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + z\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = xH + yX + zY$. Thus, any element of $\\mathfrak{sl}(2, \\mathbb{R})$ can be written as a linear combination of $H, X, Y$, showing that they span $\\mathfrak{sl}(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n\n## Step 5: Compute the structure constants\nThe structure constants are defined by $[H, X] = c_{HX}^H H + c_{HX}^X X + c_{HX}^Y Y$, $[H, Y] = c_{HY}^H H + c_{HY}^X X + c_{HY}^Y Y$, $[X, Y] = c_{XY}^H H + c_{XY}^X X + c_{XY}^Y Y$, and similarly for other pairs. Let's compute these Lie brackets.\n- $[H, X] = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 2 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = 2X$.\n- $[H, Y] = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ -2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = -2Y$.\n- $[X, Y] = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = H$.\n\n## Step 6: Express the results in terms of structure constants\nFrom Step 5, we have:\n- $[H, X] = 2X$, implying $c_{HX}^X = 2$ and $c_{HX}^H = c_{HX}^Y = 0$.\n- $[H, Y] = -2Y$, implying $c_{HY}^Y = -2$ and $c_{HY}^H = c_{HY}^X = 0$.\n- $[X, Y] = H$, implying $c_{XY}^H = 1$ and $c_{XY}^X = c_{XY}^Y = 0$.\n\nThe final answer is: \n\nLet $\\mathfrak{sl}(2, \\mathbb{R})$ be the Lie algebra of $2 \\times 2$ real matrices with trace zero, with the Lie bracket $[A, B] = AB - BA$. Show that the matrices $H = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$, $X = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, and $Y = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ form a basis for $\\mathfrak{sl}(2, \\mathbb{R})$ and compute the structure constants with respect to this basis.",

The localization functor \\(S^{-1}(-)\\) is exact.\n   \nIt will follow that \\(F(G)=G\\otimes_{\\mathbb Z}\\mathbb Q\\) is exact.\n\n---\n\n## 1) Identify \\(G\\otimes_{\\mathbb Z}\\mathbb Q\\) with localization \\(S^{-1}G\\)\n\nRecall the general fact for any commutative ring \\(R\\), multiplicative set \\(S\\subset R\\), and \\(R\\)-module \\(M\\): there is a natural isomorphism\n\\[\nM\\otimes_R S^{-1}R \\;\\xrightarrow{\\;\\sim\\;}\\; S^{-1}M,\n\\qquad\nm\\otimes \\frac r s \\mapsto \\frac{rm}{s}.\n\\]\nWe specialize to \\(R=\\mathbb Z\\), \\(S=\\mathbb Z\\setminus\\{0\\}\\), so \\(S^{-1}\\mathbb Z=\\mathbb Q\\). Thus for every abelian group \\(G\\),\n\\[\nG\\otimes_{\\mathbb Z}\\mathbb Q \\;\\cong\\; S^{-1}G.\n\\]\nConcretely, define\n\\[\n\\Phi_G: G\\otimes_{\\mathbb Z}\\mathbb Q \\to S^{-1}G,\\qquad\ng\\otimes \\frac ab \\mapsto \\frac{ag}{b}\n\\quad (a\\in\\mathbb Z,\\ b\\in S).\n\\]\nThis is well-defined and \\(\\mathbb Z\\)-bilinear, hence induces a group homomorphism from the tensor product. An inverse is given by\n\\[\n\\Psi_G: S^{-1}G\\to G\\otimes_{\\mathbb Z}\\mathbb Q,\\qquad\n\\frac g b \\mapsto g\\otimes \\frac 1 b,\n\\]\nwhich is well-defined because the defining equivalence relation for localization exactly matches the relations in the tensor product (this is the standard verification for the isomorphism \\(M\\otimes_R S^{-1}R\\cong S^{-1}M\\)). One checks \\(\\Phi_G\\circ \\Psi_G=\\mathrm{id}\\) and \\(\\Psi_G\\circ \\Phi_G=\\mathrm{id}\\). Naturality in \\(G\\) is immediate from the formula.\n\nHence, up to canonical natural isomorphism,\n\\[\nF(G)=G\\otimes_{\\mathbb Z}\\mathbb Q \\cong S^{-1}G.\n\\]\n\nSo it suffices to show that \\(S^{-1}(-)\\) is exact.\n\n---\n\n## 2) Localization \\(S^{-1}(-)\\) is exact\n\nLet\n\\[\n0 \\longrightarrow A \\xrightarrow{f} B \\xrightarrow{g} C \\longrightarrow 0\n\\]\nbe a short exact sequence of abelian groups. Consider the induced sequence\n\\[\n0 \\longrightarrow S^{-1}A \\xrightarrow{S^{-1}f} S^{-1}B \\xrightarrow{S^{-1}g} S^{-1}C \\longrightarrow 0.\n\\]\nWe prove it is exact.\n\n### (i) Injectivity of \\(S^{-1}f\\)\n\nSuppose \\(\\frac{a}{s}\\in S^{-1}A\\) maps to \\(0\\in S^{-1}B\\). Then\n\\[\nS^{-1}f\\!\\left(\\frac{a}{s}\\right)=\\frac{f(a)}{s}=0\n\\]\nin \\(S^{-1}B\\). By the definition of localization, \\(\\frac{f(a)}{s}=0\\) means there exists \\(t\\in S\\) such that\n\\[\nt\\cdot f(a)=0 \\quad \\text{in } B.\n\\]\nSince \\(f\\) is injective, \\(t\\cdot f(a)=f(ta)=0\\) implies \\(ta=0\\) in \\(A\\). Again by the definition of localization, \\(ta=0\\) for some \\(t\\in S\\) implies \\(\\frac{a}{s}=0\\) in \\(S^{-1}A\\). Thus \\(S^{-1}f\\) is injective.\n\n### (ii) Surjectivity of \\(S^{-1}g\\)\n\nTake any \\(\\frac{c}{s}\\in S^{-1}C\\). Since \\(g\\) is surjective, choose \\(b\\in B\\) with \\(g(b)=c\\). Then\n\\[\nS^{-1}g\\!\\left(\\frac{b}{s}\\right)=\\frac{g(b)}{s}=\\frac{c}{s},\n\\]\nso \\(S^{-1}g\\) is surjective.\n\n### (iii) Exactness in the middle: \\(\\ker(S^{-1}g)=\\mathrm{im}(S^{-1}f)\\)\n\nFirst, \\(\\mathrm{im}(S^{-1}f)\\subseteq \\ker(S^{-1}g)\\) because \\(g\\circ f=0\\).\n\nConversely, suppose \\(\\frac{b}{s}\\in S^{-1}B\\) lies in \\(\\ker(S^{-1}g)\\). Then\n\\[\n0 = S^{-1}g\\!\\left(\\frac{b}{s}\\right)=\\frac{g(b)}{s}\n\\]\nin \\(S^{-1}C\\). By definition of localization, there exists \\(t\\in S\\) such that\n\\[\nt\\cdot g(b)=0 \\quad \\text{in } C.\n\\]\nEquivalently, \\(g(tb)=0\\), so \\(tb\\in \\ker(g)=\\mathrm{im}(f)\\). Thus there exists \\(a\\in A\\) with \\(f(a)=tb\\). Then in \\(S^{-1}B\\),\n\\[\n\\frac{b}{s}=\\frac{tb}{ts}=\\frac{f(a)}{ts} = S^{-1}f\\!\\left(\\frac{a}{ts}\\right),\n\\]\nso \\(\\frac{b}{s}\\in \\mathrm{im}(S^{-1}f)\\). Hence \\(\\ker(S^{-1}g)\\subseteq \\mathrm{im}(S^{-1}f)\\), proving equality.\n\nTherefore the localized sequence is short exact. So \\(S^{-1}(-)\\) is an exact functor.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Conclude exactness of \\(F(G)=G\\otimes_{\\mathbb Z}\\mathbb Q\\)\n\nFrom (1), we have a natural isomorphism of functors\n\\[\n-\\otimes_{\\mathbb Z}\\mathbb Q \\;\\cong\\; S^{-1}(-).\n\\]\nSince \\(S^{-1}(-)\\) is exact, and exactness is preserved under natural isomorphism of functors, it follows that\n\\[\nF:\\mathbf{Ab}\\to \\mathbf{Ab},\\qquad F(G)=G\\otimes_{\\mathbb Z}\\mathbb Q\n\\]\nis exact (i.e. it takes every short exact sequence in \\(\\mathbf{Ab}\\) to a short exact sequence).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Thus the functor }G\\mapsto G\\otimes_{\\mathbb Z}\\mathbb Q\\text{ is exact.}}\n\\]",

K-theory is crucial in various areas of mathematics and physics.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a problem\nTo create a problem, we need to understand what kind of questions are typically asked in K-theory. A common type of problem involves calculating the K-theory groups of a specific space or understanding the properties of K-theory groups under certain operations.\n\n## Step 4: Generate a specific problem\nLet's generate a problem related to the K-theory of a particular space. Consider the space $S^2$, the 2-sphere. A relevant problem could be to compute $K^0(S^2)$ and $K^1(S^2)$, which are related to the complex vector bundles on $S^2$.\n\n## Step 5: Formulate the problem in the required format\nWe need to provide a problem in the format: \"Compute $K^0(X)$ and $K^1(X)$ for $X = S^2$,\" where $S^2$ is the 2-sphere.\n\n## Step 6: Provide the solution\nTo solve this, we recall that $K^0(X)$ is the Grothendieck group of complex vector bundles on $X$, and $K^1(X)$ is related to the stable homotopy group $\\pi_1(GL(\\mathbb{C}))$ or equivalently, for $X = S^2$, it involves understanding the clutching functions. For $S^2$, $K^0(S^2)$ can be computed using the fact that $S^2$ is a compact space and the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence or directly knowing that $K^0(S^2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$ because $S^2$ can be seen as a suspension of $S^1$, and using the fact that $K^1(S^1) = \\mathbb{Z}$ and the Bott periodicity. $K^1(S^2) = 0$ because $S^2$ is simply connected and thus has no non-trivial principal bundles that would contribute to $K^1$.\n\n## Step 7: Write down the problem and its solution\n### Problem\nCompute $K^0(S^2)$ and $K^1(S^2)$.",

    "question": "## Step 1: Understand the task and the domain\nThe task is to generate a challenging but solvable mathematics problem in the domain of Potential theory, along with a complete and verifiable solution. Potential theory involves the study of harmonic functions, potentials, and their applications, particularly in relation to partial differential equations like Laplace's equation.\n\n## Step 2: Identify key concepts in Potential theory\nKey concepts in Potential theory include the Laplace equation ($\\Delta u = 0$), Poisson's equation ($\\Delta u = f$), and boundary value problems (Dirichlet and Neumann problems). A challenging problem should involve some of these advanced concepts or techniques.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a problem\nLet's consider a problem involving the Dirichlet problem for the Laplace equation on a specific domain. The Dirichlet problem involves finding a function $u$ that satisfies $\\Delta u = 0$ in a given domain $D$ and $u = f$ on $\\partial D$, where $f$ is a given function on the boundary of $D$.\n\n## Step 4: Specify the problem\nConsider the unit disk $D = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2: |x| < 1\\}$. We need to find $u(x)$ such that $\\Delta u = 0$ in $D$ and $u(x) = \\log|x - (1,0)|$ on $\\partial D$. This problem is well-posed as it specifies the domain, the equation to be satisfied, and the boundary condition.\n\n## Step 5: Provide the solution\nThe solution to the Dirichlet problem can be given by the Poisson integral formula. However, recognizing that $\\log|x - (1,0)|$ is harmonic in $D$ (since the singularity at $x = (1,0)$ is on $\\partial D$, not inside $D$), the solution $u(x)$ is directly $\\log|x - (1,0)|$ because it satisfies $\\Delta u = 0$ in $D$ and matches the boundary condition on $\\partial D$.\n\n## Step 6: Verify the solution\nTo verify, note that $\\log|x - (1,0)|$ is indeed harmonic in $D$ because it is the real part of the analytic function $\\log(z - 1)$ (for $z = x + iy$) in $D$. On $\\partial D$, $|x| = 1$, so $x = (\\cos\\theta, \\sin\\theta)$ for $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)$, and thus $u(x)$ on $\\partial D$ is $\\log|\\cos\\theta - 1 + i\\sin\\theta| = \\log\\sqrt{(\\cos\\theta - 1)^2 + \\sin^2\\theta} = \\log\\sqrt{2 - 2\\cos\\theta}$, which matches the given boundary condition.\n\nThe final answer is: \n\n\nLet $D = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2: |x| < 1\\}$ be the unit disk in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Find the solution $u(x)$ to the Dirichlet problem $\\Delta u = 0$ in $D$, $u(x) = \\log|x - (1,0)|$ on $\\partial D$.",

    "question": "## Step 1: Understand the task and the domain\nThe task is to generate a challenging but solvable mathematics problem in the domain of \"Several complex variables and analytic spaces\" along with a complete and verifiable solution. The problem should be well-posed, clear, non-trivial, and solvable with established mathematical methods.\n\n## Step 2: Identify key concepts in the domain\nSeveral complex variables and analytic spaces involve the study of functions of multiple complex variables and the spaces on which these functions are defined. Key concepts include holomorphic functions, complex manifolds, analytic continuation, and various types of domains (e.g., domains of holomorphy, pseudoconvex domains).\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a problem\nTo create a problem, we need to focus on a specific aspect of several complex variables. Let's consider the concept of holomorphic functions on a domain in $\\mathbb{C}^n$. A potential problem could involve characterizing or analyzing the properties of such functions.\n\n## Step 4: Specify the problem\nLet's formulate a problem related to the extension of holomorphic functions. A well-known result in several complex variables is the Hartogs' extension theorem, which states that any holomorphic function defined on a domain in $\\mathbb{C}^n$ ($n > 1$) with a compact hole can be extended holomorphically to the whole domain. We can create a problem related to this concept.\n\n## Step 5: Create the problem statement\nConsider the domain $\\Omega = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}^2 : |z_1| < 1, |z_2| < 1\\}$ and the subset $S = \\{z \\in \\Omega : |z_1| < \\frac{1}{2}\\}$. Let $f$ be a holomorphic function on $\\Omega \\setminus S$. Show that $f$ can be extended to a holomorphic function on $\\Omega$.\n\n## Step 6: Provide the solution\nTo solve this, we recognize that for each fixed $z_2$, $f(z_1, z_2)$ is holomorphic in $z_1$ for $\\frac{1}{2} \\leq |z_1| < 1$. By the principle of analytic continuation in one variable, $f(z_1, z_2)$ can be extended holomorphically to $|z_1| < 1$ because the singularity is removable. This extension is holomorphic in both $z_1$ and $z_2$ due to the properties of holomorphic functions in several complex variables.\n\n## Step 7: Detail the solution\nFor any $z_2$ with $|z_2| < 1$, consider $f(z_1, z_2)$ as a function of $z_1$. Since $f$ is holomorphic on $\\Omega \\setminus S$, for $\\frac{1}{2} \\leq |z_1| < 1$, $f(z_1, z_2)$ is holomorphic in $z_1$. The function can be extended to $|z_1| < 1$ by Riemann's theorem on removable singularities because for each $z_2$, the set $|z_1| \\leq \\frac{1}{2}$ is a compact subset of $|z_1| < 1$. The extended function is holomorphic in $z_1$ for each $z_2$. To show it's holomorphic in both variables, we can use the fact that the extension is given by a Cauchy integral formula which is jointly continuous and holomorphic in $z_2$ for each $z_1$, implying joint holomorphicity.\n\nThe final answer is: \n\nLet $\\Omega = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}^2 : |z_1| < 1, |z_2| < 1\\}$ and $S = \\{z \\in \\Omega : |z_1| < \\frac{1}{2}\\}$.

    "question": "## Step 1: Understand the task and the domain\nThe task is to generate a challenging but solvable mathematics problem in the domain of difference and functional equations, along with a complete and verifiable solution. The problem should be well-posed, clear, non-trivial, and solvable with established mathematical methods.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the key elements of a good problem in the domain\nA good problem in the domain of difference and functional equations should involve a functional equation or a difference equation that requires substantive mathematical reasoning to solve. It should be fully specified, with clear notation and constraints.\n\n## Step 3: Generate a problem\nLet's generate a problem: \"Find all functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the functional equation $f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) + xy$ for all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$, and $f(1) = 1$.\"\n\n## Step 4: Verify that the generated problem meets the quality rubric\n- **Well-Posedness and Completeness**: The problem is fully self-contained, with the domain and codomain of $f$ specified, and the functional equation given.\n- **Clarity**: The notation is standard, and the task is clear.\n- **Non-Triviality**: The problem requires solving a functional equation, which is non-trivial.\n- **Solvability and Verification**: The problem is solvable using established methods for functional equations.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the generated problem\nTo solve $f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) + xy$, let's first try substituting specific values for $x$ and $y$ to derive additional information.\n\n## Step 6: Substitute $x = y = 0$ into the equation\n$f(0 + 0) = f(0) + f(0) + 0 \\cdot 0$ simplifies to $f(0) = 2f(0)$, which implies $f(0) = 0$.\n\n## Step 7: Substitute $y = 1$ into the original equation\n$f(x + 1) = f(x) + f(1) + x = f(x) + x + 1$, since $f(1) = 1$. This gives a recursive formula to find $f(x)$ for integer values of $x$.\n\n## Step 8: Use the recursive formula to find $f(n)$ for any integer $n$\nStarting from $f(0) = 0$ and $f(1) = 1$, we can derive $f(2)$, $f(3)$, etc., to look for a pattern. $f(2) = f(1) + f(1) + 1 = 3$, $f(3) = f(2) + f(1) + 2 = 6$. It appears that $f(n) = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ for positive integers $n$.\n\n## Step 9: Check if $f(x) = \\frac{x(x+1)}{2}$ satisfies the original functional equation\nSubstitute $f(x) = \\frac{x(x+1)}{2}$ into $f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) + xy$:\n- LHS: $f(x + y) = \\frac{(x+y)(x+y+1)}{2} = \\frac{x^2 + 2xy + y^2 + x + y}{2}$\n- RHS: $f(x) + f(y) + xy = \\frac{x(x+1)}{2} + \\frac{y(y+1)}{2} + xy = \\frac{x^2 + x + y^2 + y + 2xy}{2}$\nBoth sides are equal, so $f(x) = \\frac{x(x+1)}{2}$ is a solution.\n\n## Step 10: Verify that the solution satisfies the initial condition\n$f(1) = \\frac{1(1+1)}{2} = 1$, which matches the given condition.\n\n\nFind all functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the functional equation $f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) + xy$ for all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$, and $f(1) = 1$.",

    "question": "## Step 1: Understand the task\nThe task is to generate a challenging but solvable mathematics problem in the domain of Operator Theory, along with a complete and verifiable solution. The problem should be well-posed, clear, non-trivial, and solvable with established mathematical methods.\n\n## Step 2: Review the given topic and previous attempts\nThe topic is Operator Theory, and a previous attempt was made with the question: \"Let $T: L^2[0,1] \\to L^2[0,1]$ be defined by $Tf(x) = \\int_{0}^{x} f(t) dt$. Prove that $T$ is compact and find its spectrum.\" This question was adjudicated incorrect, and we need to generate a materially different, well-posed, and simpler question.\n\n## Step 3: Identify key concepts in Operator Theory\nOperator Theory involves the study of linear operators between vector spaces, particularly focusing on their properties such as boundedness, compactness, and spectral properties. A simpler question should still involve these concepts but in a more straightforward manner.\n\n## Step 4: Generate a new problem\nTo create a simpler problem, consider a basic operator and ask a fundamental question about its properties. For example, consider the operator $T: \\mathbb{C}^2 \\to \\mathbb{C}^2$ defined by a matrix. We can ask to determine if $T$ is bounded and find its spectrum.\n\n## Step 5: Formulate the problem\nLet's define $T: \\mathbb{C}^2 \\to \\mathbb{C}^2$ by $T(x, y) = (x + y, y)$. This can be represented by the matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The task is to show that $T$ is bounded and to find its spectrum.\n\n## Step 6: Write the problem statement\n\"Let $T: \\mathbb{C}^2 \\to \\mathbb{C}^2$ be defined by $T(x, y) = (x + y, y)$. Show that $T$ is a bounded operator and find its spectrum.\"\n\n## Step 7: Provide the solution\nTo show $T$ is bounded, we need to show there exists a constant $M$ such that $\\|T(x, y)\\| \\leq M\\|(x, y)\\|$ for all $(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{C}^2$. Using the standard Euclidean norm, $\\|(x, y)\\| = \\sqrt{|x|^2 + |y|^2}$, we have $\\|T(x, y)\\| = \\|(x + y, y)\\| = \\sqrt{|x + y|^2 + |y|^2}$. By the triangle inequality, $|x + y| \\leq |x| + |y|$, so $|x + y|^2 \\leq (|x| + |y|)^2 \\leq 2(|x|^2 + |y|^2)$, hence $\\|T(x, y)\\| = \\sqrt{|x + y|^2 + |y|^2} \\leq \\sqrt{2(|x|^2 + |y|^2) + |y|^2} = \\sqrt{2|x|^2 + 3|y|^2} \\leq \\sqrt{3(|x|^2 + |y|^2)} = \\sqrt{3}\\|(x, y)\\|$. Thus, $T$ is bounded with $M = \\sqrt{3}$.\n\nTo find the spectrum, we need to find $\\lambda$ such that $T - \\lambda I$ is not invertible. The matrix representation of $T - \\lambda I$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 - \\lambda & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 - \\lambda \\end{pmatrix}$. This matrix is not invertible if its determinant is zero, i.e., $(1 - \\lambda)^2 = 0$. Thus, $\\lambda = 1$ is the only eigenvalue, and since $T$ is a bounded operator on a finite-dimensional space, its spectrum consists of its eigenvalues. Hence, the spectrum of $T$ is $\\{1\\}$.\n\n## Step 8: Format the output\n\nLet $T: \\mathbb{C}^2 \\to \\mathbb{C}^2$ be defined by $T(x, y) = (x + y, y)$. Show that $T$ is a bounded operator and find its spectrum.",

The problem should be well-posed, clear, non-trivial, and solvable with established mathematical methods.\n\n## Step 2: Identify a suitable problem in the domain\nA classic problem in calculus of variations is finding the curve that minimizes the distance between two points. However, to make it more challenging and relevant to optimal control, we can consider a problem that involves optimizing a functional subject to certain constraints.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate the problem\nLet's consider the problem of finding the function $y(x)$ that minimizes the functional $J[y] = \\int_{0}^{1} (y'^2 + y) \\,dx$, subject to the boundary conditions $y(0) = 0$ and $y(1) = 1$. This problem is relevant to the calculus of variations and involves optimizing a functional.\n\n## Step 4: Write down the problem statement\nThe problem can be stated as: \"Minimize $J[y] = \\int_{0}^{1} (y'^2 + y) \\,dx$ subject to $y(0) = 0$ and $y(1) = 1$, where $y(x)$ is a continuously differentiable function on $[0,1]$.\"\n\n## Step 5: Provide the solution to the problem\nTo solve this, we use the Euler-Lagrange equation, which states that for a functional $J[y] = \\int_{a}^{b} F(x, y, y') \\,dx$, the extremal $y(x)$ satisfies $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} - \\frac{d}{dx}(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y'}) = 0$. Here, $F = y'^2 + y$, so $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 1$ and $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y'} = 2y'$.\n\n## Step 6: Apply the Euler-Lagrange equation\nSubstituting into the Euler-Lagrange equation gives $1 - \\frac{d}{dx}(2y') = 0$, which simplifies to $1 - 2y'' = 0$. Thus, $y'' = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n## Step 7: Solve the differential equation\nIntegrating $y'' = \\frac{1}{2}$ twice gives $y(x) = \\frac{x^2}{4} + Ax + B$, where $A$ and $B$ are constants.\n\n## Step 8: Apply the boundary conditions\nUsing $y(0) = 0$ gives $B = 0$, and $y(1) = 1$ gives $1 = \\frac{1}{4} + A$, so $A = \\frac{3}{4}$.\n\n## Step 9: Write the solution\nThus, $y(x) = \\frac{x^2}{4} + \\frac{3x}{4}$.\n\n## Step 10: Verify the solution\nTo verify, we check that $y(x)$ satisfies the boundary conditions and the Euler-Lagrange equation. $y(0) = 0$ and $y(1) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{3}{4} = 1$, so the boundary conditions are satisfied.

    "question": "## Step 1: Understand the task and the given domain\nThe task is to generate a challenging but solvable mathematics problem in the domain of special functions, along with a complete and verifiable solution. The given domain is special functions, and we need to create a problem that is simpler than the previously attempted questions but still challenging.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the properties and examples of special functions\nSpecial functions include the Gamma function, Bessel functions, elliptic functions, and others. The Gamma function, denoted by $\\Gamma(x)$, is defined as $\\Gamma(x) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t^{x-1}e^{-t}dt$ for $x > 0$. It has various properties and applications in mathematics and physics.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a problem related to special functions\nTo create a problem, let's consider a basic property or application of special functions. One fundamental property is the Gamma function's relation to factorials for positive integers, given by $\\Gamma(n+1) = n!$. A simple and challenging problem could involve proving or verifying an identity or inequality related to the Gamma function.\n\n## Step 4: Generate a specific problem\nLet's consider the problem: \"Prove that $\\Gamma(x+1) = x\\Gamma(x)$ for $x > 0$, where $\\Gamma(x) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t^{x-1}e^{-t}dt$.\"\n\n## Step 5: Provide a solution to the generated problem\nTo prove that $\\Gamma(x+1) = x\\Gamma(x)$, we start with the definition of $\\Gamma(x+1)$:\n$\\Gamma(x+1) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t^{x}e^{-t}dt$.\nUsing integration by parts with $u = t^x$ and $dv = e^{-t}dt$, we have $du = xt^{x-1}dt$ and $v = -e^{-t}$. Thus,\n$\\Gamma(x+1) = \\left[-t^xe^{-t}\\right]_{0}^{\\infty} + x\\int_{0}^{\\infty} t^{x-1}e^{-t}dt$.\nThe first term vanishes at both limits because $e^{-t}$ decays faster than $t^x$ grows as $t \\to \\infty$ for $x > 0$, and at $t = 0$, $t^x = 0$ for $x > 0$. Thus,\n$\\Gamma(x+1) = x\\int_{0}^{\\infty} t^{x-1}e^{-t}dt = x\\Gamma(x)$.\n\n## Step 6: Format the problem and solution according to the required output format\n\nProve that $\\Gamma(x+1) = x\\Gamma(x)$ for $x > 0$, where $\\Gamma(x) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t^{x-1}e^{-t}dt$.",

    "question": "## Step 1: Understand the task and the requirements for the problem.\nThe task is to generate a challenging but solvable mathematics problem in the domain of real functions, along with a complete and verifiable solution. The problem must be well-posed, clear, non-trivial, and solvable with established mathematical methods.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the specific area within real functions to focus on.\nGiven the broad domain of real functions, we can consider various aspects such as differentiation, integration, functional equations, or properties of specific types of functions.\n\n## Step 3: Choose a specific topic within real functions that can be used to create a challenging problem.\nLet's consider the topic of functional equations, which involves finding a function that satisfies a given equation involving the function and its inputs.\n\n## Step 4: Generate a challenging problem in the chosen topic.\nConsider the functional equation $f(x + y) = \\frac{f(x) + f(y)}{1 - f(x)f(y)}$ for $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$, where $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$. The task is to find all $f$ that satisfy this equation.\n\n## Step 5: Ensure the problem is well-posed and meets the quality rubric.\nThe given functional equation is well-defined, and the task is clear. We need to verify that it's non-trivial and solvable.\n\n## Step 6: Provide a solution to the generated problem.\nTo solve $f(x + y) = \\frac{f(x) + f(y)}{1 - f(x)f(y)}$, let's first check if there are any obvious solutions. For $y = 0$, we get $f(x) = \\frac{f(x) + f(0)}{1 - f(x)f(0)}$. This simplifies to $f(x)(1 - f(x)f(0)) = f(x) + f(0)$, or $f(x) - f(x)^2f(0) = f(x) + f(0)$, leading to $-f(x)^2f(0) = f(0)$. If $f(0) \\neq 0$, this gives $f(x)^2 = -1$ for all $x$, which is impossible for real-valued $f$. Thus, $f(0) = 0$.\n\n## Step 7: Continue solving the functional equation.\nSetting $y = x$, we have $f(2x) = \\frac{2f(x)}{1 - f(x)^2}$. Assuming $f$ is differentiable, differentiating both sides with respect to $y$ and then setting $y = 0$ gives $f'(x) = f'(0)(1 + f(x)^2)$ because $f(0) = 0$. So, $f'(x) = f'(0)(1 + f(x)^2)$.\n\n## Step 8: Solve the differential equation obtained from the functional equation.\nThe differential equation $f'(x) = f'(0)(1 + f(x)^2)$ can be solved by separation of variables: $\\frac{df}{1 + f^2} = f'(0)dx$. Integrating both sides gives $\\arctan(f(x)) = f'(0)x + C$, where $C$ is a constant. Since $f(0) = 0$, we have $C = 0$. Thus, $f(x) = \\tan(f'(0)x)$.\n\n## Step 9: Verify that the solution satisfies the original functional equation.\nSubstituting $f(x) = \\tan(f'(0)x)$ into the original equation verifies that it's a solution due to the tangent addition formula.\n\n## Step 10: Check if there are any constraints on $f'(0)$.\nFor $f(x) = \\tan(f'(0)x)$ to be defined for all $x$, $f'(0)$ must be $0$, otherwise, $f(x)$ will have discontinuities. If $f'(0) = 0$, then $f(x) = 0$ for all $x$, which is a solution.\n\n## Step 11: Formulate the final problem and solution.\nThe problem is: \"Find all $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy $f(x + y) = \\frac{f(x) + f(y)}{1 - f(x)f(y)}$ for all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\"\n\nThe final answer is: \n\nFind all $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy $f(x + y) = \\frac{f(x) + f(y)}{1 - f(x)f(y)}$ for all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.",

Contradiction.\n\nTherefore **no such holomorphic extension \\(F\\) exists in general**.\n\n---\n\n## 3) What additional hypothesis would make an extension theorem true?\n\nA correct Hartogs-type extension statement in \\(\\mathbb C^2\\) requires the removed set to be \u201csmall enough,\u201d e.g. **relatively compact in \\(\\Omega\\)** (so that the domain contains a \u201cshell\u201d around it), or one works with the classical **Hartogs figure**. For example, if one instead removes the *smaller bidisc*\n\\[\nS'=\\{(z_1,z_2): |z_1|<\\tfrac12,\\ |z_2|<\\tfrac12\\}\\Subset\\Omega,\n\\]\nthen every holomorphic function on \\(\\Omega\\setminus S'\\) **does** extend holomorphically to \\(\\Omega\\) (Hartogs\u2019 extension theorem).\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\nAs stated, the problem is ill-posed (since \\(\\Omega\\setminus S\\) is not open) and the claimed extension property is **false** even after the natural \u201copen-set\u201d correction, with counterexample \\(f(z_1,z_2)=1/z_1\\). To make the statement true, \\(S\\) must be replaced by a relatively compact \u201chole\u201d (e.g. a smaller bidisc) or one must assume \\(f\\) is given on a Hartogs figure.",
