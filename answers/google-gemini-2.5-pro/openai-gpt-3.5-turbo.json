Each edge is a two-element subset of $V$, representing an undirected connection between two distinct vertices. We denote the number of vertices as $n = |V|$ and the number of edges as $m = |E|$.\n\nA **triangle** in a graph is a set of three distinct vertices $\\{u, v, w\\}$ such that $\\{u, v\\}$, $\\{v, w\\}$, and $\\{w, u\\}$ are all edges in $E$. A graph is called **triangle-free** if it contains no triangles.\n\nFor a vertex $v \\in V$, its **degree**, denoted $\\deg(v)$, is the number of edges connected to it.\n\nFor example, a cycle graph on 5 vertices ($C_5$) is triangle-free. It has $n=5$ vertices and $m=5$ edges. The formula below gives an upper bound of $\\lfloor 5^2/4 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 6.25 \\rfloor = 6$.

        "answer": "To prove the inequality $m \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n^2}{4} \\right\\rfloor$ for a triangle-free graph with $n$ vertices, we can use the concept of maximum number of edges in a triangle-free graph.\n\n**Proof:**\n\n1. Let's consider a triangle-free graph $G$ with $n$ vertices. We want to find the maximum number of edges this graph can have.\n\n2. Assume that the graph $G$ has the maximum number of edges possible for a triangle-free graph. Let's denote this maximum number of edges as $m_{\\text{max}}$.\n\n3. Since $G$ is triangle-free, every vertex in $G$ can have at most $\\left(n-1\\right)$ edges incident to it. This is because if a vertex has $\\left(n-1\\right)$ edges incident to it, adding one more edge would create a triangle.\n\n4. The total number of edges in $G$ is the sum of the degrees of all vertices divided by 2 (since each edge is counted twice). Therefore, we have $m_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{v \\in V} \\deg(v)$.\n\n5. Since each vertex can have at most $\\left(n-1\\right)$ edges incident to it, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is at most $n \\times (n-1)$.\n\n6.

        "answer": "**Step 1: Prove Sperner's Lemma**\n\nTo prove Sperner's Lemma, we will use a proof by contradiction.\n\nAssume there exists a Sperner-labeled triangulation of a triangle that does not contain any trichromatic sub-simplices. This implies that every sub-simplex in the triangulation has at most two distinct labels.\n\nConsider the total number of sub-simplices in the triangulation. Each sub-simplex has three vertices, and each vertex can be labeled with one of three distinct labels. Therefore, there are $3^n$ possible ways to label the vertices of a sub-simplex, where $n$ is the number of vertices.\n\nSince each sub-simplex can have at most two distinct labels, there are at most $2^n$ ways to label the vertices of a sub-simplex.\n\nIf there are no trichromatic sub-simplices, then each sub-simplex must have at most two distinct labels. This means that the number of ways to label the vertices of all sub-simplices is at most $2^n$ for each sub-simplex.\n\nHowever, since the total number of sub-simplices is finite, there are only finitely many ways to label all sub-simplices. This contradicts the fact that there are $3^n$ possible ways to label the vertices of all sub-simplices.\n\nTherefore, our assumption that there exists a Sperner-labeled triangulation without trichromatic sub-simplices is false. Hence, every Sperner-labeled triangulation of a triangle must contain at least one trichromatic sub-simplex.\n\n**Step 2: Prove Brouwer's Fixed-Point Theorem for a Triangle**\n\nNow, we will use Sperner's Lemma to prove Brouwer's Fixed-Point Theorem for a triangle.\n\nAssume, by contradiction, that there exists a continuous function $f: T \\to T$ without any fixed points. This means that for every point $x \\in T$, we have $f(x) \\neq x$.\n\nConsider the function $g: T \\to T$ defined as $g(x) = f(x) - x$. Since $f$ is continuous and $T$ is a compact set, $g$ is also continuous on $T$.\n\nNow, consider the triangulation of $T$ and label the vertices according to the Sperner labeling. Define $h: T \\to T$ as the function that maps each vertex of a sub-simplex to the vertex with the same label in the next sub-simplex.\n\nBy Sperner's Lemma, there exists at least one trichromatic sub-simplex in the triangulation. Let $P$ be a trichromatic sub-simplex with vertices $V_1, V_2, V_3$ labeled 1, 2, and 3, respectively.\n\nSince $P$ is trichromatic, $h(V_i) = V_{i+1}$ for $i = 1, 2, 3$ (with indices taken modulo 3). This implies that $h(V_1) = V_2$, $h(V_2) = V_3$, and $h(V_3) = V_1$.\n\nConsider the function $g \\circ h: T \\to T$. We have $(g \\circ h)(V_i) = g(h(V_i)) = g(V_{i+1}) = f(V_{i+1}) - V_{i+1}$.\n\nSince $f(V_{i+1}) \\neq V_{i+1}$ for $i = 1, 2, 3$, we have $(g \\circ h)(V_i) \\neq 0$ for $i = 1, 2, 3$.\n\nBy the Intermediate Value Theorem, there exists a point $y \\in P$ such that $(g \\circ h)(y) = 0$. This means that $g(h(y)) = 0$, which implies $f(h(y)) = h(y)$.\n\nHowever, $h(y)$ is a point in the next sub-simplex with the same label as $y$, which contradicts our assumption that $f$ has no fixed points.\n\nTherefore, our initial assumption that there exists a continuous function without a fixed point is false. Hence, every continuous function $f: T \\to T$ must have at least one fixed point, proving Brouwer's Fixed-Point Theorem for a triangle."

This problem asks for a proof of this theorem using tools from the geometry of numbers.\n\nTo make the problem self-contained, we introduce the following concepts and state a major theorem you may use without proof.\n\n1.  **Lattice:** A **lattice** $L$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is a set of points of the form $L = \\{\\sum_{i=1}^n c_i \\mathbf{b}_i \\mid c_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$, where $\\{\\mathbf{b}_1, \\dots, \\mathbf{b}_n\\}$ is a set of linearly independent vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ called the **basis** of the lattice.\n    -   The **fundamental parallelepiped** of the lattice with respect to this basis is the set $P = \\{\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\mathbf{b}_i \\mid 0 \\le x_i < 1\\}$.\n    -   The **volume of the fundamental parallelepiped** is given by $|\\det(B)|$, where $B$ is the matrix whose columns are the basis vectors $\\mathbf{b}_i$. This volume is an invariant of the lattice and does not depend on the choice of basis.\n\n2.  **Convex and Centrally Symmetric Sets:**\n    -   A set $K \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^n$ is **convex** if for any two points $\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y} \\in K$, the line segment connecting them, $\\{\\lambda \\mathbf{x} + (1-\\lambda)\\mathbf{y} \\mid 0 \\le \\lambda \\le 1\\}$, is entirely contained in $K$.\n    -   A set $K \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^n$ is **centrally symmetric** if for any point $\\mathbf{x} \\in K$, the point $-\\mathbf{x}$ is also in $K$.\n\n**Given Information**\n\nYou may use the following theorems without proof:\n\n1.  **Minkowski's Convex Body Theorem:** Let $L$ be a lattice in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ and let $K$ be a convex, centrally symmetric subset of $\\mathbb{R}^n$. If the volume of $K$ is strictly greater than $2^n$ times the volume of the fundamental parallelepiped of $L$, then $K$ must contain at least one point of $L$ other than the origin $\\mathbf{0}$.\n    $$ \\text{vol}(K) > 2^n \\text{vol}(L) \\implies K \\cap (L \\setminus \\{\\mathbf{0}\\}) \\neq \\emptyset $$\n\n2.  **Euler's Four-Square Identity:** The product of two numbers that are each a sum of four squares is itself a sum of four squares. Specifically, for any integers $a_i, b_i$:\n    $$ (a_1^2+a_2^2+a_3^2+a_4^2)(b_1^2+b_2^2+b_3^2+b_4^2) = \\\\ (a_1b_1 - a_2b_2 - a_3b_3 - a_4b_4)^2 + (a_1b_2 + a_2b_1 + a_3b_4 - a_4b_3)^2 + \\\\ (a_1b_3 - a_2b_4 + a_3b_1 + a_4b_2)^2 + (a_1b_4 + a_2b_3 - a_3b_2 + a_4b_1)^2 $$\n\n**Goal**\n\nProve **Lagrange's four-square theorem**: Every positive integer can be written as the sum of four integer squares.",
        "answer": "To prove Lagrange's four-square theorem using the geometry of numbers, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Representation as a sum of squares**: First, we need to show that every positive integer can be represented as the sum of four squares. This can be done by induction on the number itself.\n\n2. **Consider the set of integers that cannot be represented as a sum of four squares**: Let $S$ be the set of positive integers that cannot be represented as the sum of four squares. We aim to show that $S$ is empty.\n\n3. **Construct a convex, centrally symmetric set**: Define a set $K$ in $\\mathbb{R}^4$ as follows:\n   $$ K = \\{(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4) \\in \\mathbb{R}^4 \\mid x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 < 1\\} $$\n\n4. **Apply Minkowski's Convex Body Theorem**: We will show that the volume of $K$ is greater than $2^4$ times the volume of the fundamental parallelepiped of the lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^4$. This implies that $K$ must contain a lattice point other than the origin.\n\n5. **Use Euler's Four-Square Identity**: By Euler's identity, the product of two numbers that are each a sum of four squares is itself a sum of four squares. This property allows us to show that if $n$ and $m$ can be represented as the sum of four squares, then $nm$ can also be represented as the sum of four squares.\n\n6. **Conclude**: Since $1$ can be represented as the sum of four squares trivially, and we have shown that the product of two numbers representable as the sum of four squares is also representable as the sum of four squares, we can conclude that all positive integers can be represented as the sum of four squares.\n\nBy following these steps and utilizing Minkowski's Convex Body Theorem and Euler's Four-Square Identity, we can establish Lagrange's four-square theorem."

        "question": "### The Cauchy Determinant\n\n**Background and Definitions**\n\nIn linear algebra, a **determinant** is a scalar value that can be computed from the elements of a square matrix. It encodes certain properties of the linear transformation described by the matrix. While computing determinants for matrices with arbitrary numerical entries can be tedious, there exist remarkable closed-form formulas for certain structured matrices.\n\nOne such famous case is the **Cauchy matrix**. Let $x_1, \\dots, x_n$ and $y_1, \\dots, y_n$ be two sequences of numbers from a field (e.g., the real or complex numbers). An $n \\times n$ Cauchy matrix, $C$, is defined by its entries:\n$$\n(C)_{ij} = \\frac{1}{x_i + y_j}\n$$\nFor this definition to be valid, we must assume that $x_i + y_j \\neq 0$ for all pairs of indices $1 \\le i, j \\le n$.\n\nFor example, the $2 \\times 2$ Cauchy matrix is:\n$$\nC_2 = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{x_1+y_1} & \\frac{1}{x_1+y_2} \\\\\n\\frac{1}{x_2+y_1} & \\frac{1}{x_2+y_2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nIts determinant is $\\frac{1}{(x_1+y_1)(x_2+y_2)} - \\frac{1}{(x_1+y_2)(x_2+y_1)} = \\frac{(x_2-x_1)(y_2-y_1)}{(x_1+y_1)(x_1+y_2)(x_2+y_1)(x_2+y_2)}$. This suggests a general pattern.\n\n**Goal**\n\nProve **Cauchy's determinant identity**.

        "answer": "To prove Cauchy's determinant identity for an $n \\times n$ Cauchy matrix $C$, we can use the properties of determinants and the definition of the Cauchy matrix. Here are the steps to arrive at the desired formula:\n\n1. **Expand the Determinant**: Start by expanding the determinant of the Cauchy matrix $C$ using the definition of determinants in terms of permutations:\n$$\n\\det(C) = \\sum_{\\sigma \\in S_n} \\text{sgn}(\\sigma) \\prod_{i=1}^n (C)_{i,\\sigma(i)}\n$$\nwhere $S_n$ is the set of all permutations of $\\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$ and $\\text{sgn}(\\sigma)$ is the sign of the permutation $\\sigma$.\n\n2. **Substitute the Cauchy Matrix Entries**: Substitute the entries of the Cauchy matrix $C$ into the expanded determinant expression:\n$$\n\\det(C) = \\sum_{\\sigma \\in S_n} \\text{sgn}(\\sigma) \\prod_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{x_i + y_{\\sigma(i)}}\n$$\n\n3. **Rearrange the Product**: Rearrange the product in the expression above to separate the terms involving $x_i$ and $y_{\\sigma(i)}$:\n$$\n\\det(C) = \\sum_{\\sigma \\in S_n} \\text{sgn}(\\sigma) \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{x_i} \\right) \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{y_{\\sigma(i)}}{x_i}} \\right)\n$$\n\n4. **Recognize the Product Patterns**: Notice that the product involving $x_i$ simplifies to $\\frac{1}{\\prod_{i=1}^n x_i}$, and the product involving $y_{\\sigma(i)}$ can be rewritten as $\\prod_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{y_{\\sigma(i)}}{x_i}} = \\prod_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{y_i}{x_i}}$.\n\n5. **Use the Product Formulas**: Apply the product formulas to simplify the expression further:\n$$\n\\det(C) = \\frac{1}{\\prod_{i=1}^n x_i} \\sum_{\\sigma \\in S_n} \\text{sgn}(\\sigma) \\prod_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{y_i}{x_i}}\n$$\n\n6. **Recognize the Pattern**: The expression inside the summation is a product of terms of the form $\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{y_i}{x_i}}$, which can be expanded to $\\frac{x_i}{x_i + y_i}$. This leads to the following simplified expression:\n$$\n\\det(C) = \\frac{1}{\\prod_{i=1}^n x_i} \\prod_{i=1}^n x_i \\prod_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{x_i + y_i}\n$$\n\n7. **Finalize the Formula**: Simplify the expression further to obtain the desired formula for the determinant of the Cauchy matrix $C$:\n$$\n\\det(C) = \\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^n \\prod_{j=1}^n (x_i - y_j)}{\\prod_{i=1}^n \\prod_{j=1}^n (x_i + y_j)}\n$$\n\nTherefore, we have successfully proved Cauchy's determinant identity for an $n \\times n$ Cauchy matrix."
