        "answer": "## Step 1: Understand the given functional equation\nThe given functional equation is $P(x)P(x+1) = P(x^2)$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{C}$, where $P(x)$ is a non-constant polynomial. We need to find all such polynomials that satisfy this equation.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the degree of $P(x)$\nLet's denote the degree of $P(x)$ as $d$. Then, the degree of $P(x+1)$ is also $d$ because the degree of a polynomial is invariant under a change of variable. The degree of $P(x)P(x+1)$ is $d + d = 2d$, and the degree of $P(x^2)$ is $2d$. So, we have $2d = d + d$, which is true for any $d$, but it gives us an equation to relate the degrees: $d = 2d$ is not necessarily true; instead, we directly compare the degrees of both sides of the equation.\n\n## Step 3: Derive the degree of $P(x)$ using the given equation\nSince $P(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $d$, $P(x)P(x+1)$ is of degree $d + d = 2d$, and $P(x^2)$ is of degree $2d$. Thus, we have $2d = 2d$, which is always true. However, to find $d$, we should directly compare the degrees of both sides of the given functional equation. The degree of $P(x^2)$ is $2d$, and the degree of $P(x)P(x+1)$ is $d + d = 2d$. This implies that the degree of $P(x)$ on both sides of the equation must be equal.\n\n## Step 4: Examine the properties of $P(x)$ based on its degree\nLet's start by assuming $P(x)$ is of degree $d$. Then, $P(x^2)$ is of degree $2d$. For the equation $P(x)P(x+1) = P(x^2)$ to hold, the degrees of both sides must be equal. Thus, $d + d = 2d$, which is true. To find a specific form of $P(x)$, we need to analyze the roots or the behavior of $P(x)$.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze the roots of $P(x)$\nFor any root $r$ of $P(x)$, $P(r) = 0$, which implies $P(r^2) = 0$ because $P(r)P(r+1) = P(r^2)$. Thus, if $r$ is a root, $r^2$ is also a root. Repeatedly applying this, we see that $r, r^2, (r^2)^2, ...$ are roots. For a polynomial of degree $d$, if $r$ is a root, then $r^{2^n}$ for any $n$ should also be a root if $r^{2^n}$ is not equal to any previous value. However, for a polynomial of finite degree, this sequence must eventually terminate or cycle.\n\n## Step 6: Consider the implications of $P(x) = x^n$ for some $n$\nIf $P(x) = x^n$, then $P(x)P(x+1) = x^n(x+1)^n$ and $P(x^2) = (x^2)^n = x^{2n}$. So, $x^n(x+1)^n = x^{2n}$, which simplifies to $(x+1)^n = x^n$ for $x \\neq 0$. This is not generally true for all $x$, indicating that $P(x) = x^n$ is not a solution unless $n = 0$ or the equation holds due to specific properties of $x$.\n\n## Step 7: Solve for $P(x)$ using the given functional equation\nTo satisfy the given equation, let's directly check if $P(x) = x^n$ is a solution. Substituting $P(x) = x^n$ into the equation yields $x^n(x+1)^n = (x^2)^n$, which simplifies to $x^n(x+1)^n = x^{2n}$. This implies $(x+1)^n = x^n$ when $x \\neq 0$, which is not true for all $x$ unless $n = 0$ or the specific structure of $P(x)$ allows it.\n\n## Step 8: Re-evaluate the approach based on polynomial properties\nSince $P(x)P(x+1) = P(x^2)$, let's analyze the roots. If $x$ is a root of $P(x)$, then $P(x) = 0$, so $P(x)P(x+1) = 0$, implying $P(x^2) = 0$. Thus, $x^2$ is a root if $x$ is a root.\n\n## Step 9: Simplify the problem by directly checking the polynomial equation\nFor $x = 0$, $P(0)P(1) = P(0)$, which simplifies to $P(0)(P(1) - 1) = 0$. If $P(0) = 0$, then $0$ is a root. Let's examine if $P(x) = x$ is a solution. Substituting $P(x) = x$ into the original equation yields $x(x+1) = x^2$, which is not true. However, we need to directly solve or analyze the given functional equation.\n\n## Step 10: Analyze $P(x) = x^n$ as a potential solution\nLet's directly check if $P(x) = x^n$ satisfies the given equation. $P(x+1) = (x+1)^n$ and $P(x^2) = (x^2)^n = x^{2n}$. So, $x^n(x+1)^n = x^{2n}$, which simplifies to $(x+1)^n = x^n$ for $x \\neq 0$. This must hold for all $x$, which is a strong condition.\n\n## Step 11: Determine the polynomial that satisfies the given condition\nAfter analyzing the properties, we find that $P(x) = x^n$ is a potential solution if it satisfies the given functional equation. Let's directly check the condition for $P(x) = x^n$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$"

        "answer": "## Step 1: Understand the definition of the elementary symmetric polynomial $s_k(x_1, ..., x_n)$.\nThe elementary symmetric polynomial $s_k(x_1, ..., x_n)$ is defined as the sum of all distinct products of $k$ variables from the set $\\{x_1, ..., x_n\\}$. For instance, $s_2(a, b, c) = ab + ac + bc$.\n\n## Step 2: Recognize the given problem and identify $s_{p-2}(1, 2, ..., p-1)$.\nWe need to find $s_{p-2}(1, 2, ..., p-1)$, which is the sum of all distinct products of $p-2$ numbers from the set $\\{1, 2, ..., p-1\\}$.\n\n## Step 3: Recall Vieta's formulas to relate $s_k$ to the roots of a polynomial.\nVieta's formulas state that for a polynomial $a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_1x + a_0 = 0$ with roots $r_1, r_2, ..., r_n$, the sum of the products of the roots taken $k$ at a time is given by $(-1)^k \\cdot \\frac{a_{n-k}}{a_n}$. Here, we're interested in the polynomial whose roots are $1, 2, ..., p-1$.\n\n## Step 4: Identify a polynomial whose roots are $1, 2, ..., p-1$.\nThe polynomial with roots $1, 2, ..., p-1$ can be written as $(x-1)(x-2)...(x-(p-1))$. This polynomial is equivalent to $x^{p-1} - 1$ modulo $p$ by Fermat's Little Theorem, but to apply Vieta's formulas directly, we consider the polynomial $P(x) = (x-1)(x-2)...(x-(p-1))$.\n\n## Step 5: Expand $P(x)$ to apply Vieta's formulas.\n$P(x) = x^{p-1} - s_1(1,2,...,p-1)x^{p-2} + s_2(1,2,...,p-1)x^{p-3} - ... + (-1)^{p-1}s_{p-1}(1,2,...,p-1)$. By Vieta's, $s_{p-2}(1, 2, ..., p-1)$ is the coefficient of $x^2$ in $P(x)$, up to a sign.\n\n## Step 6: Compute $P(x)$ explicitly to find $s_{p-2}$.\n$P(x) = (x-1)(x-2)...(x-(p-1))$. To find the coefficient of $x^2$, we need to consider how $x^2$ terms are generated. This involves looking at the product of the roots and the pattern of coefficients.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the problem using properties of factorials and modular arithmetic.\nNotice that $P(x) = \\frac{x^p - x}{x}$, because $x^p - x = x(x-1)(x-2)...(x-(p-1))$ modulo $p$. Thus, $P(x) = \\frac{x(x^{p-1} - 1)}{x} = x^{p-1} - 1$ modulo $p$. However, to find $s_{p-2}$, we need to directly compute or use properties of $P(x)$.\n\n## Step 8: Use the fact that $x^{p-1} - 1 = (x-1)(x-2)...(x-(p-1))$ modulo $p$ to derive $P(x)$ modulo $p^2$.\nTo find $s_{p-2}$ modulo $p^2$, we should directly examine the expansion of $(x-1)(x-2)...(x-(p-1))$ and its coefficients.\n\n## Step 9: Apply modular arithmetic to simplify $s_{p-2}(1, 2, ..., p-1)$.\nSince $s_{p-2}$ is related to the coefficient of $x^2$ in $P(x)$, let's directly calculate this coefficient. The coefficient of $x^2$ in the expansion of $P(x)$ can be derived from considering the sum of products of pairs of roots, which relates to $s_2$.\n\n## Step 10: Derive the coefficient of $x^2$ in $P(x)$ using the expansion.\nThe expansion of $P(x)$ gives us $s_{p-2}$ as the coefficient of $x^2$ with a sign change due to Vieta's formulas: $(-1)^{p-2}s_{p-2}$. For $p>3$, $p$ is odd, so $(-1)^{p-2} = 1$. Thus, we are looking for the coefficient of $x^2$ in $(x-1)(x-2)...(x-(p-1))$.\n\n## Step 11: Simplify the expression for $s_{p-2}$ using modular properties.\nTo simplify, note that $s_1 = \\frac{(p-1)p}{2}$ and $s_2 = \\sum_{1 \\leq i < j \\leq p-1} ij$. The formula for $s_2$ can be derived from $s_1^2 - 2s_2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{p-1} i^2$, giving $s_2 = \\frac{s_1^2 - \\sum_{i=1}^{p-1} i^2}{2}$.\n\n## Step 12: Calculate $s_1$ and $\\sum_{i=1}^{p-1} i^2$ modulo $p^2$.\n$s_1 = 1 + 2 + ... + (p-1) = \\frac{(p-1)p}{2}$, which is $0$ modulo $p$ but $\\frac{p(p-1)}{2}$ modulo $p^2$. $\\sum_{i=1}^{p-1} i^2 = \\frac{(p-1)p(2p-1)}{6}$.\n\n## Step 13: Evaluate $s_2$ modulo $p^2$ using the results from Step 12.\n$s_1 = \\frac{p(p-1)}{2}$ and $\\sum_{i=1}^{p-1} i^2 = \\frac{p(p-1)(2p-1)}{6}$. Thus, $s_2 = \\frac{(\\frac{p(p-1)}{2})^2 - \\frac{p(p-1)(2p-1)}{6}}{2}$. Simplifying this gives $s_2$ modulo $p^2$.\n\n## Step 14: Simplify the expression for $s_2$ modulo $p^2$ further.\nLet's simplify: $s_1^2 = \\frac{p^2(p-1)^2}{4}$ and $\\sum_{i=1}^{p-1} i^2 = \\frac{p(p-1)(2p-1)}{6}$. So, $s_2 = \\frac{\\frac{p^2(p-1)^2}{4} - \\frac{p(p-1)(2p-1)}{6}}{2}$. Modulo $p^2$, this simplifies because the first term is $0$ modulo $p^2$, leaving $s_2 \\equiv -\\frac{p(p-1)(2p-1)}{12}$ modulo $p^2$.\n\n## Step 15: Calculate $s_{p-2}$ modulo $p^2$ using the relation between $s_{p-2}$ and $s_2$ for $p-1$ variables.\nFor $p-1$ variables, $s_{p-2} = s_2$ because $s_k = s_{n-k}$ when considering the polynomial $x^n + ...$, here $n = p-1$. So, $s_{p-2} \\equiv -\\frac{p(p-1)(2p-1)}{12}$ modulo $p^2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$"

        "question": "### A Generalization of Euler's Partition Theorem\n\nLet $n$ be a positive integer. A **partition** of $n$ is a way of writing $n$ as a sum of positive integers, where the order of the addends (called **parts**) does not matter. For example, the partitions of 4 are:\n-   $4$\n-   $3 + 1$\n-   $2 + 2$\n-   $2 + 1 + 1$\n-   $1 + 1 + 1 + 1$\n\nLet $k$ be a fixed integer such that $k \\ge 2$. We define two distinct types of partitions of $n$:\n\n1.  Let $A_k(n)$ be the number of partitions of $n$ where none of the parts are divisible by $k$.\n2.  Let $B_k(n)$ be the number of partitions of $n$ where no part appears $k$ or more times.\n\nFor example, consider $n=4$ and $k=3$:\n-   To calculate $A_3(4)$, we count partitions of 4 whose parts are not divisible by 3. The allowed parts are $\\{1, 2, 4, 5, \\dots\\}$.

        "answer": "## Step 1: Understand the problem and the definitions of $A_k(n)$ and $B_k(n)$\nThe problem asks us to prove that $A_k(n) = B_k(n)$ for all positive integers $n$ and any integer $k \\ge 2$, where $A_k(n)$ is the number of partitions of $n$ where none of the parts are divisible by $k$, and $B_k(n)$ is the number of partitions of $n$ where no part appears $k$ or more times.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze $A_k(n)$\nTo calculate $A_k(n)$, we need to count the number of partitions of $n$ into parts that are not divisible by $k$. This means we are looking at partitions where every part is of the form $kq + r$, where $q$ is a non-negative integer and $r$ is an integer such that $1 \\leq r \\leq k-1$.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze $B_k(n)$\nFor $B_k(n)$, we count the partitions of $n$ where no part appears $k$ or more times. This implies that for any part $p$ in a partition, $p$ can appear at most $k-1$ times.\n\n## Step 4: Establish a bijection between $A_k(n)$ and $B_k(n)$\nTo prove $A_k(n) = B_k(n)$, we can establish a bijection between the sets of partitions counted by $A_k(n)$ and $B_k(n)$. This involves showing that each partition counted by $A_k(n)$ can be uniquely mapped to a partition counted by $B_k(n)$ and vice versa.\n\n## Step 5: Construct the bijection\nLet's consider a partition counted by $A_k(n)$. We can represent this partition as a sum of parts where each part is not divisible by $k$. To map it to a partition counted by $B_k(n)$, we can use the following strategy: for each part $p$ in the partition, if $p$ is not divisible by $k$, we can keep it as is. However, to directly establish a bijection, we need a more systematic approach that involves transforming the partitions.\n\n## Step 6: Use generating functions to prove the identity\nInstead of directly constructing a bijection, we can use generating functions. The generating function for $A_k(n)$ is given by $\\prod_{i=1, i \\not\\equiv 0 \\mod k}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1-x^i}$, because it counts partitions into parts not divisible by $k$. The generating function for $B_k(n)$ is $\\prod_{i=1}^{\\infty} (1 + x^i + x^{2i} + \\cdots + x^{(k-1)i}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1-x^{ki}}{1-x^i}$, because it counts partitions where each part $i$ appears at most $k-1$ times.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the generating function for $B_k(n)$\nSimplifying the generating function for $B_k(n)$, we have $\\prod_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1-x^{ki}}{1-x^i}$. This can be further simplified by expanding the product: $\\frac{(1-x^k)(1-x^{2k})(1-x^{3k})\\cdots}{(1-x)(1-x^2)(1-x^3)\\cdots}$. Simplifying this expression, we notice that terms of the form $1-x^{ki}$ in the numerator cancel out the corresponding terms in the denominator that are divisible by $k$, leaving us with $\\prod_{i=1, i \\not\\equiv 0 \\mod k}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1-x^i}$.\n\n## Step 8: Compare the generating functions for $A_k(n)$ and $B_k(n)$\nBoth $A_k(n)$ and $B_k(n)$ have the same generating function: $\\prod_{i=1, i \\not\\equiv 0 \\mod k}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1-x^i}$. This implies that $A_k(n) = B_k(n)$ for all $n$, because they count the same number of partitions.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{A_k(n) = B_k(n)}$"

        "answer": "## Step 1: Understand the problem and the condition for a matrix to be an involution.\nTo find the number of involutions in $M_2(\\mathbb{F}_q)$, we need to understand what makes a matrix $A$ an involution. A matrix $A$ is an involution if $A^2 = I$, where $I$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix. This means we are looking for matrices $A$ such that $A^2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the general form of a $2 \\times 2$ matrix $A$ and the condition $A^2 = I$.\nLet $A = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$. Then, $A^2 = \\begin{pmatrix} a^2 + bc & b(a + d) \\\\ c(a + d) & d^2 + bc \\end{pmatrix}$. For $A$ to be an involution, $A^2 = I$, which gives us the equations $a^2 + bc = 1$, $b(a + d) = 0$, $c(a + d) = 0$, and $d^2 + bc = 1$.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the conditions given by $A^2 = I$ to simplify the problem.\nFrom $A^2 = I$, we have the conditions $a^2 + bc = 1$ and $d^2 + bc = 1$ (since $b(a + d) = 0$ and $c(a + d) = 0$ imply $a + d = 0$ or $b = c = 0$). For $b(a + d) = 0$ and $c(a + d) = 0$, if $b = c = 0$, then $a^2 = d^2 = 1$, which simplifies to $a = \\pm 1$ and $d = \\pm 1$. However, we need to consider the cases when $a + d = 0$ and when $b = c = 0$.\n\n## Step 4: Examine the case when $a + d = 0$.\nIf $a + d = 0$, then $d = -a$. Substituting into the equations, we get $a^2 + bc = 1$ and $b(a + d) = 0$ simplifies to $2b(a) = 0$ and $c(a + d) = 0$ simplifies to $2c(a) = 0$ because $a + d = 0$ implies $d = -a$. For $a = 0$, $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & b \\\\ c & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, and $A^2 = \\begin{pmatrix} bc & 0 \\\\ 0 & bc \\end{pmatrix}$. For $A^2 = I$, $bc = 1$, so $b$ and $c$ are either both non-zero or both zero, but since $bc = 1$, they are non-zero.\n\n## Step 5: Count the number of involutory matrices based on the condition $A^2 = I$.\nTo count involutions, consider $A = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$ where $d = -a$. So, $A = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & -a \\end{pmatrix}$. For $A^2 = I$, we have $\\begin{pmatrix} a^2 + bc & 0 \\\\ 0 & a^2 + bc \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. This implies $a^2 + bc = 1$. The number of such matrices can be derived by considering the possible values of $a, b, c$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the number of involutions based on the characteristic equation.\nFor a matrix $A$ to satisfy $A^2 = I$, the eigenvalues must be $\\pm 1$. Thus, the characteristic polynomial of $A$ must be $(x - 1)(x + 1) = x^2 - 1$. This implies that the trace of $A$ is $0$, and the determinant is $-1$. So, $a + d = 0$ and $ad - bc = -1$. For $2 \\times 2$ matrices, this translates to the condition that $a + d = 0$ and $ad - bc = -1$.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the counting by directly considering the matrix equation $A^2 = I$.\nFor $A = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$, $A^2 = I$ gives $a + d = 0$ or $d = -a$. So, $A = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & -a \\end{pmatrix}$. The condition $A^2 = I$ leads to $a^2 + bc = 1$ and $-a^2 - bc = -1$, simplifying to $a^2 + bc = 1$.\n\n## Step 8: Count the involutory matrices.\nLet's directly count the matrices satisfying $A^2 = I$. For $A = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & -a \\end{pmatrix}$, we need $a^2 + bc = 1$. The number of such matrices can be counted based on the values of $a, b, c$.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate the number of involutions based on $a$ and $d = -a$.\nSince $a + d = 0$, $d = -a$. So, we have $A = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & -a \\end{pmatrix}$. For $A^2 = I$, we must have $a^2 + bc = 1$ and $-a^2 + bc = 1$, which simplifies to $a^2 = 1$ and $bc = 0$. Thus, $a = \\pm 1$.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the total number of involutory matrices.\nFor $a = 1$, $b = 0$ or $c = 0$. For $a = -1$, $b = 0$ or $c = 0$. So, the possible matrices are $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & b \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$, $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & c \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$, $\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & b \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, and $\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ c & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. However, we need to directly count the involutions.\n\n## Step 11: Simplify the counting by directly analyzing the conditions for $a, b, c, d$.\nFor $A = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$, if $A^2 = I$, then $a + d = 0$ or $d = -a$. So, $A = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & -a \\end{pmatrix}$. The condition $A^2 = I$ gives $a^2 + bc = 1$.\n\n## Step 12: Finalize the count of involutory matrices.\nTo count involutory matrices, consider $a^2 + bc = 1$. For $a = 1$ or $a = -1$, we have specific conditions. When $a = 1$, $1 + bc = 1$, so $bc = 0$. When $a = -1$, $1 + bc = 1$, so $bc = 0$. This gives us the conditions for $b$ and $c$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{q^2 + q}$"

Prove that $M(x,y)$ cannot be written as a sum of squares of polynomials with real coefficients.\n\nThis demonstrates that the converse of the statement \"a sum of squares is positive semidefinite\" is false.",
        "answer": "## Step 1: Understand the given problem and the Motzkin polynomial\nThe problem asks us to prove two properties of the Motzkin polynomial $M(x, y) = x^4 y^2 + x^2 y^4 - 3x^2 y^2 + 1$. First, we need to prove that $M(x,y)$ is positive semidefinite, meaning $M(x,y) \\ge 0$ for all real $x$ and $y$. Second, we need to show that $M(x,y)$ cannot be expressed as a sum of squares of polynomials with real coefficients.\n\n## Step 2: Prove that $M(x,y)$ is positive semidefinite\nTo prove $M(x,y)$ is positive semidefinite, let's manipulate the given expression. We can rewrite $M(x,y)$ as follows:\n$M(x,y) = x^4y^2 + x^2y^4 - 3x^2y^2 + 1 = x^2y^2(x^2 + y^2 - 3) + 1$.\nHowever, a more effective approach is to directly apply the AM-GM inequality to the terms involving $x$ and $y$. The AM-GM inequality states that for non-negative real numbers $a$ and $b$, $\\frac{a + b}{2} \\ge \\sqrt{ab}$.\n\n## Step 3: Apply AM-GM inequality to prove non-negativity\nUsing AM-GM on $x^4y^2$ and $x^2y^4$, we get:\n$x^4y^2 + x^2y^4 \\ge 2\\sqrt{x^4y^2 \\cdot x^2y^4} = 2x^3y^3$.\nThus, $M(x,y) = x^4y^2 + x^2y^4 - 3x^2y^2 + 1 \\ge 2x^3y^3 - 3x^2y^2 + 1$.\nLet's further simplify this by factoring out $x^2y^2$ from the first two terms of the inequality:\n$2x^3y^3 - 3x^2y^2 + 1 = x^2y^2(2xy - 3) + 1$.\nHowever, the direct application of AM-GM to $x^4y^2$ and $x^2y^4$ yields $x^4y^2 + x^2y^4 \\ge 2x^3y^3$, and we should directly examine $M(x,y)$.\n\n## Step 4: Directly examine $M(x,y)$ for non-negativity\nLet's directly analyze $M(x,y)$:\n$M(x,y) = x^4y^2 + x^2y^4 - 3x^2y^2 + 1 = x^2y^2(x^2 + y^2 - 3) + 1$.\nFor $x = y = 1$, $M(1,1) = 1 + 1 - 3 + 1 = 0$, showing that $M(x,y)$ can be zero, thus it's non-negative if we can show it's never negative.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify $M(x,y)$ using a different approach\nConsider $M(x,y)$ as $M(x,y) = (x^2y^2 - 1)^2 + x^2y^2(x^2 + y^2 - 2)$, but a more straightforward factorization or manipulation is needed to directly prove non-negativity.\n\n## Step 6: Apply a correct manipulation to prove $M(x,y) \\ge 0$\nNotice that $x^4y^2 + x^2y^4 + 1 - 3x^2y^2 = (x^2y^2 - 1)^2 + x^2y^2(x^2 + y^2 - 2)$ is not the correct manipulation. Instead, observe that:\n$M(x,y) = x^2y^2(x^2 + y^2 - 3) + 1 \\ge 0$ when $x^2y^2(x^2 + y^2 - 3) \\ge -1$.\nFor $xy = 0$, $M(x,y) = 1$, which is positive. For $xy \\neq 0$, we can divide by $x^2y^2$ and examine the condition.\n\n## Step 7: Prove that $M(x,y)$ is non-negative using AM-GM directly on the polynomial\nBy AM-GM, $x^4y^2 + x^2y^4 \\ge 2x^3y^3$, so $M(x,y) \\ge 2x^3y^3 - 3x^2y^2 + 1$. Let's analyze $2x^3y^3 - 3x^2y^2 + 1$ further.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze $2x^3y^3 - 3x^2y^2 + 1$\nLet $t = xy$, then $2x^3y^3 - 3x^2y^2 + 1 = 2t^3 - 3t^2 + 1$. We need to show $2t^3 - 3t^2 + 1 \\ge 0$ for all $t$.\n\n## Step 9: Examine the expression $2t^3 - 3t^2 + 1$\n$2t^3 - 3t^2 + 1 = (t-1)^2(2t+1)$. This expression is non-negative when $2t + 1 \\ge 0$, or $t \\ge -\\frac{1}{2}$. Since $t = xy$, this implies $xy \\ge -\\frac{1}{2}$. For $xy < 0$, the condition still holds because $(t-1)^2$ is always non-negative, and $2t+1$ is non-negative for $t \\ge -\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n## Step 10: Prove $M(x,y)$ cannot be written as a sum of squares\nAssume $M(x,y) = \\sum_{i=1}^k [Q_i(x,y)]^2$. For $x = y = 0$, $M(0,0) = 1$, so $\\sum_{i=1}^k [Q_i(0,0)]^2 = 1$. For $x = y = 1$, $M(1,1) = 0$, implying $\\sum_{i=1}^k [Q_i(1,1)]^2 = 0$, thus $Q_i(1,1) = 0$ for all $i$. This suggests that each $Q_i(x,y)$ has a factor of $(x-1)$ or $(y-1)$, but a more rigorous approach is needed to show $M(x,y)$ is not a sum of squares.\n\n## Step 11: Detailed analysis for sum of squares\nTo prove $M(x,y)$ is not a sum of squares, consider its degree and the degrees of potential $Q_i(x,y)$. $M(x,y)$ is of degree 6. If $M(x,y) = \\sum_{i=1}^k [Q_i(x,y)]^2$, then the degree of $Q_i(x,y)$ must be 3 because the degree of $M(x,y)$ is 6.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{M(x,y)}$"

        "answer": "## Step 1: Understand the given problem and the definition of angular defect\nThe problem asks us to prove that for a convex polyhedron $P$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, the sum of the angular defects over all its vertices is given by $2\\pi(V - E + F)$, where $V, E,$ and $F$ are the number of vertices, edges, and faces of $P$, respectively.

A central achievement of 20th-century mathematics was the complete classification of all finite simple groups.\n\nThis problem asks you to prove that a group of a particular order cannot be one of these fundamental blocks.\n\n**Goal:** Prove that no group of order 144 can be simple.\n\n*You may use standard theorems of finite group theory, such as Lagrange's theorem and the Sylow theorems, without proof.*",
        "answer": "## Step 1: Understand the problem and the goal\nWe need to prove that a group of order 144 cannot be simple. A simple group is one whose only normal subgroups are the trivial subgroup and the group itself. The order of the group is given as 144, which factors into $2^4 \\times 3^2$.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the Sylow theorems\nThe Sylow theorems state that for a group $G$ of order $p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}...p_n^{a_n}$, where $p_i$ are distinct primes, there exists a Sylow $p_i$-subgroup (a subgroup of order $p_i^{a_i}$) for each $i$. Moreover, the number of Sylow $p_i$-subgroups, $n_{p_i}$, satisfies $n_{p_i} \\equiv 1 \\mod p_i$ and $n_{p_i}$ divides $|G|/p_i^{a_i}$.\n\n## Step 3: Apply Sylow theorems to the given problem for $p = 2$ and $p = 3$\nFor $p = 2$, $|G| = 144 = 2^4 \\times 3^2$, so $n_2$ must satisfy $n_2 \\equiv 1 \\mod 2$ and $n_2$ divides $3^2 = 9$. Thus, $n_2$ could be 1, 3, or 9.\n\nFor $p = 3$, $n_3$ must satisfy $n_3 \\equiv 1 \\mod 3$ and $n_3$ divides $2^4 = 16$. Thus, $n_3$ could be 1, 4, or 16.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the case for $n_2 = 1$\nIf $n_2 = 1$, then there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which is normal. A group with a normal subgroup other than the trivial subgroup or the group itself is not simple. Thus, if $n_2 = 1$, $G$ is not simple.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze the case for $n_3 = 1$\nIf $n_3 = 1$, then there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which is normal. Thus, if $n_3 = 1$, $G$ is not simple.\n\n## Step 6: Examine the possibility of $G$ being simple when $n_2 > 1$ and $n_3 > 1$\nFor $G$ to be simple, both $n_2$ and $n_3$ must be greater than 1. Let's examine $n_2 = 3$ or $9$, and $n_3 = 4$ or $16$.\n\n## Step 7: Consider $n_3 = 4$\nIf $n_3 = 4$, then there are 4 Sylow 3-subgroups. Each Sylow 3-subgroup has order $3^2 = 9$, and they intersect trivially (since if two subgroups of order 9 intersect non-trivially, they must be the same subgroup due to having the same order and being subgroups of a larger group). The number of elements of order 3 or $3^2$ is $4 \\times (9 - 1) = 32$ because each Sylow 3-subgroup contributes 8 elements of order 3 or 9 (excluding the identity, which is counted once for each subgroup but should only be counted once).\n\n## Step 8: Consider $n_2 = 9$\nIf $n_2 = 9$, there are 9 Sylow 2-subgroups. Each has order $2^4 = 16$. The number of elements in Sylow 2-subgroups can be calculated by considering that each Sylow 2-subgroup has 16 elements, but some elements may be counted multiple times.\n\n## Step 9: Analyze the number of elements in Sylow 2-subgroups for $n_2 = 9$\nFor $n_2 = 9$, let's consider the elements. Each Sylow 2-subgroup has 16 elements. If we simply multiply, we get $9 \\times 16 = 144$ elements, but this counts some elements more than once. The identity is counted 9 times. For a group to be simple, it cannot have a normal Sylow subgroup, but we need to check if the number of elements and the structure allow for simplicity.\n\n## Step 10: Check for simplicity based on Sylow subgroup counts\nLet's directly check the implications of having $n_3 = 4$ and the structure it imposes. If $n_3 = 4$, the group acts on these 4 Sylow 3-subgroups by conjugation, giving a homomorphism from $G$ to $S_4$. The kernel of this homomorphism is a normal subgroup of $G$. Since $|G| = 144 = 2^4 \\times 3^2$ and $|S_4| = 24 = 2^3 \\times 3$, the image of $G$ in $S_4$ has order dividing both 144 and 24, hence dividing their gcd, which is $2^3 \\times 3 = 24$. This implies the image could be $S_4$ or a subgroup of $S_4$ of order 12 or less that is divisible by 3 (since $G$ has elements of order 3).\n\n## Step 11: Evaluate the homomorphism to $S_4$ for simplicity\nThe kernel of the homomorphism to $S_4$ must be trivial for $G$ to be simple because a non-trivial kernel is a non-trivial normal subgroup. The order of the image of $G$ in $S_4$ is $|G|/|\\text{kernel}|$. For $G$ to be simple and $|G|=144$, the image must have order 144 or a divisor that corresponds to a quotient that is simple. However, $|S_4|=24$, so $|G/\\text{kernel}| \\leq 24$, implying the kernel is non-trivial since $144/24 = 6$, meaning the kernel has order at least 6.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{G}$"

This problem involves a specific equation with two variables where the goal is to find all integer points on the curve it defines.\n\nConsider the equation:\n$$ y^2 = x^4 + 2x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + 5 $$\n\n**Goal:** Find all pairs of integers $(x, y)$ that satisfy this equation.",
        "answer": "## Step 1: Understand the given Diophantine equation\nThe given equation is $y^2 = x^4 + 2x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + 5$. We need to find all integer pairs $(x, y)$ that satisfy this equation.\n\n## Step 2: Manipulate the equation to simplify or identify patterns\nTo simplify the equation, let's try to factor or manipulate it. Notice that $x^4 + 2x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + 5$ can be rewritten by completing the square or factoring. However, directly factoring seems challenging, so let's examine the structure of the equation closely.\n\n## Step 3: Attempt to simplify the equation by rearranging terms\nRearranging or simplifying the given equation directly is not straightforward. Instead, we can try to relate it to known factorable forms or use modular arithmetic to reduce the problem.\n\n## Step 4: Use modular arithmetic to reduce the problem\nLet's consider the equation modulo 4 to simplify it. For any integer $x$, $x^2 \\mod 4$ can be 0 or 1. Thus, $x^4 \\mod 4$ is 0 or 1. Similarly, $2x^3 \\mod 4$ is 0 or 2 (since $2x^3$ is even and can be 0 or 2 mod 4), $2x^2 \\mod 4$ is 0 or 2, $2x \\mod 4$ is 0 or 2, and $5 \\mod 4$ is 1.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze the equation modulo 4\nFor $x = 0$, the equation becomes $y^2 = 5$, which has no integer solution because $y^2 = 5$ implies $y = \\sqrt{5}$, and $\\sqrt{5}$ is not an integer.\n\nFor $x = 1$, $y^2 = 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 5 = 12$, which is not a perfect square.\n\nFor $x = 2$, $y^2 = 16 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 5 = 49$, so $y = 7$ or $y = -7$. Thus, $(2, 7)$ and $(2, -7)$ are solutions.\n\nFor $x = -1$, $y^2 = 1 - 2 + 2 - 2 + 5 = 4$, so $y = 2$ or $y = -2$. Thus, $(-1, 2)$ and $(-1, -2)$ are solutions.\n\nFor $x = -2$, $y^2 = 16 - 16 + 8 - 4 + 5 = 9$, so $y = 3$ or $y = -3$. Thus, $(-2, 3)$ and $(-2, -3)$ are solutions.\n\n## Step 6: Check for larger values of $x$\nLet's examine the equation for larger $|x|$. As $x$ becomes large (positive or negative), $x^4 + 2x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + 5$ behaves like $x^4$, so $y^2$ is approximately $x^4$, implying $y$ is approximately $|x^2|$.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze the equation for large $x$\nFor large $x$, the term $x^4$ dominates. We can rewrite the equation as $y^2 = (x^2 + x + 1)^2 - (x^2 - 2x - 4)$ by attempting to complete the square or find a similar simplification. However, a more straightforward approach is to directly check if $y^2$ falls between consecutive squares for large $x$.\n\n## Step 8: Simplify the given equation further\nNotice that $y^2 = x^4 + 2x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + 5 = (x^2 + x)^2 + (x^2 + 2x + 5)$, and further simplification yields $y^2 = (x^2 + x + 1)^2 + (4 - x^2)$. For $|x| > 2$, $(x^2 + x + 1)^2 < y^2 < (x^2 + x + 2)^2$ because $4 - x^2 < 0$ and the difference between consecutive squares increases.\n\n## Step 9: Check the validity of solutions for larger $x$\nFor $|x| > 2$, we have $(x^2 + x + 1)^2 < y^2 < (x^2 + x + 2)^2$, meaning $y$ cannot be an integer because it falls between two consecutive integers.\n\n## Step 10: Enumerate and check small values of $x$\nWe've already checked $x = -2, -1, 0, 1, 2$. For $|x| > 2$, the solutions are not integers as shown by the inequality in step 9.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(-2, 3), (-2, -3), (-1, 2), (-1, -2), (2, 7), (2, -7)}$"

        "answer": "## Step 1: Understand the Problem and Mantel's Theorem\nThe problem asks us to prove Mantel's Theorem, which states that for any simple graph $G = (V, E)$ with $n$ vertices that is triangle-free, the number of edges $m$ is less than or equal to $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n^2}{4} \\right\\rfloor$. A simple graph is a graph without multiple edges between any pair of vertices and without self-loops.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the Definition of a Triangle-Free Graph\nA graph is triangle-free if it does not contain any set of three distinct vertices $\\{u, v, w\\}$ such that $\\{u, v\\}$, $\\{v, w\\}$, and $\\{w, u\\}$ are all edges in $E$. This means for any two vertices that are connected by an edge, they cannot both be connected to a third vertex.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the Approach to Prove Mantel's Theorem\nTo prove Mantel's Theorem, we can use the method of induction or a direct proof by considering the properties of a triangle-free graph. One common approach involves using the concept of vertex degrees and the fact that the graph is triangle-free to derive a bound on the number of edges.\n\n## Step 4: Use the Concept of Vertex Degrees\nFor any vertex $v \\in V$, let $\\deg(v)$ denote its degree.

Thus, $\\sum_{v \\in V} \\deg(v) = 2m$.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the Triangle-Free Condition\nConsider two vertices $u$ and $v$ that are connected by an edge. Since the graph is triangle-free, $u$ and $v$ cannot both be connected to any other vertex $w$. This implies that the neighborhoods of $u$ and $v$ (the sets of vertices directly connected to $u$ and $v$, respectively) are disjoint except possibly for the edge between $u$ and $v$ itself.\n\n## Step 6: Derive an Inequality Using Vertex Degrees\nFor any edge $\\{u, v\\}$, we have $\\deg(u) + \\deg(v) \\leq n$ because the neighbors of $u$ and $v$ are distinct (due to the triangle-free condition), and there are $n$ vertices in total. Summing this inequality over all edges gives $\\sum_{\\{u, v\\} \\in E} (\\deg(u) + \\deg(v)) \\leq mn$. Since $\\sum_{\\{u, v\\} \\in E} (\\deg(u) + \\deg(v)) = \\sum_{v \\in V} \\deg(v)^2$, we have $\\sum_{v \\in V} \\deg(v)^2 \\leq mn$.\n\n## Step 7: Apply Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality\nBy the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, $\\left(\\sum_{v \\in V} \\deg(v)\\right)^2 \\leq n \\sum_{v \\in V} \\deg(v)^2$. Substituting $\\sum_{v \\in V} \\deg(v) = 2m$ and $\\sum_{v \\in V} \\deg(v)^2 \\leq mn$ gives $(2m)^2 \\leq n(mn)$.\n\n## Step 8: Simplify the Inequality\nSimplifying the inequality from Step 7: $4m^2 \\leq mn^2$. Dividing both sides by $m$ (assuming $m > 0$), we get $4m \\leq n^2$. Thus, $m \\leq \\frac{n^2}{4}$.\n\n## Step 9: Consider the Case When $m = 0$ and the Floor Function\nFor $m = 0$, the inequality $m \\leq \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n^2}{4} \\right\\rfloor$ holds because $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n^2}{4} \\right\\rfloor \\geq 0$. For any $n$, $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n^2}{4} \\right\\rfloor$ is the greatest integer less than or equal to $\\frac{n^2}{4}$. Since $m$ is an integer, $m \\leq \\frac{n^2}{4}$ implies $m \\leq \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n^2}{4} \\right\\rfloor$.\n\n## Step 10: Conclude the Proof\nWe have shown that for a triangle-free graph with $n$ vertices, $m \\leq \\frac{n^2}{4}$. Since $m$ is an integer, it follows that $m \\leq \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n^2}{4} \\right\\rfloor$, proving Mantel's Theorem.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{m \\leq \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n^2}{4} \\right\\rfloor}$"

        "answer": "## Step 1: Understand the given problem and the goal\nThe problem asks us to prove that the canonical commutation relation $AB - BA = I$ is impossible for bounded linear operators $A$ and $B$ on a Hilbert space $H$. Here, $I$ is the identity operator on $H$.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the properties and theorems given\nWe are given three standard theorems from operator theory and Banach algebra theory:\n1. The spectrum of any element $x$ in a Banach algebra is non-empty and compact.\n2. The spectral shift theorem: $\\sigma(x + \\lambda I) = \\sigma(x) + \\lambda$.\n3. The cyclic property of spectra: $\\sigma(ab) \\setminus \\{0\\} = \\sigma(ba) \\setminus \\{0\\}$.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the given relation to the cyclic property of spectra\nLet's start with the given relation $AB - BA = I$. We need to manipulate this equation to derive a contradiction using the given theorems.\n\n## Step 4: Manipulate the given commutation relation\nFirst, consider the equation $AB - BA = I$. We can rewrite it as $AB = BA + I$. We will use this to examine the spectra of $AB$ and $BA$.\n\n## Step 5: Examine the spectrum of $AB$ and $BA$\nUsing the cyclic property of spectra, we know that $\\sigma(AB) \\setminus \\{0\\} = \\sigma(BA) \\setminus \\{0\\}$. We need to relate this to the given commutation relation.\n\n## Step 6: Derive the spectrum of $AB$ and $BA$ using the given relation\nSince $AB = BA + I$, we can directly apply the spectral shift theorem to $BA + I$ to find $\\sigma(AB) = \\sigma(BA + I) = \\sigma(BA) + 1$.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze the implication of $\\sigma(AB) = \\sigma(BA) + 1$\nFor any $\\lambda \\in \\sigma(BA)$, $\\lambda + 1 \\in \\sigma(AB)$. By the cyclic property, if $\\lambda + 1 \\neq 0$, then $\\lambda + 1 \\in \\sigma(BA)$, implying that $\\sigma(BA)$ is invariant under translation by 1, except possibly at 0.\n\n## Step 8: Consider the implications of the spectral shift on the spectrum of $BA$\nIf $\\sigma(BA)$ is non-empty, as it must be by the first theorem, and considering $\\sigma(BA) + 1 = \\sigma(AB)$, we can see that if $\\lambda \\in \\sigma(BA)$, then $\\lambda + 1, \\lambda + 2, ...$ should be in $\\sigma(AB)$ and consequently in $\\sigma(BA)$ due to the cyclic property, except for the case when $\\lambda + n = 0$ for some $n$.\n\n## Step 9: Show that the spectrum cannot satisfy the required properties\nHowever, the key insight comes from directly examining the trace or using the properties of the spectrum. For bounded operators, if $AB - BA = I$, taking the trace of both sides yields $0 = \\text{Tr}(I)$, which is not true since $\\text{Tr}(I)$ is the dimension of $H$, which is infinite for an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space or a non-zero finite number for a finite-dimensional space.\n\n## Step 10: Provide an alternative proof using the spectrum directly\nHowever, an alternative and more direct approach to prove the impossibility involves using the spectrum. Assume $AB - BA = I$. Then, for any $\\lambda$, $A(B + \\lambda I) - (B + \\lambda I)A = I$. This implies $\\sigma(AB) = \\sigma(A(B + \\lambda I)) = \\sigma((B + \\lambda I)A + I)$.\n\n## Step 11: Simplify the argument focusing on the essential steps\nLet's simplify: If $AB - BA = I$, then for any scalar $\\lambda$, we have $A(B + \\lambda I) - (B + \\lambda I)A = I$. This leads to $\\sigma(A(B + \\lambda I)) = \\sigma((B + \\lambda I)A + I)$.

For bounded operators on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, the trace is not defined for all operators, but the argument can be made using the properties of the spectrum and the fact that $A$ and $B$ are bounded.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{AB - BA = I}$"

The Gamma function is defined as $\\Gamma(z) = \\int_0^\\infty t^{z-1} e^{-t} \\,dt$ for $\\text{Re}(z) > 0$.\n\n## Step 2: Establish the Identity for $0 < \\text{Re}(z) < 1$\nTo prove the identity, we start by considering the product $\\Gamma(z) \\Gamma(1-z)$ for $0 < \\text{Re}(z) < 1$. Using the definition of $\\Gamma(z)$, we have $\\Gamma(z) = \\int_0^\\infty t^{z-1} e^{-t} \\,dt$ and $\\Gamma(1-z) = \\int_0^\\infty u^{-z} e^{-u} \\,du$.

Both sides of the equation are analytic functions of $z$ except at the poles of $\\Gamma(z)$ and $\\Gamma(1-z)$, and at $z = n$ where $n$ is an integer due to $\\sin(\\pi z)$. By the principle of analytic continuation, if two analytic functions are equal on a domain, they are equal on their common domain of analyticity.

The function $\\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi z)}$ is also analytic for all non-integer $z$.

As a consequence of this result, show that the equation $P(x) = 0$ is not solvable by radicals.",
        "answer": "## Step 1: Understand the problem and the given polynomial\nThe problem asks us to prove that the Galois group of the polynomial $P(x) = x^5 - 6x + 3$ over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ is isomorphic to the symmetric group $S_5$, and to show that the equation $P(x) = 0$ is not solvable by radicals. To start, we need to understand the properties of $P(x)$ and its roots.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the roots of $P(x)$ and its irreducibility\nFirst, we observe that $P(x)$ is a quintic polynomial. To determine its Galois group, we need to establish whether $P(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion with $p = 3$ to check for irreducibility. $P(x) = x^5 - 6x + 3$ satisfies Eisenstein's criterion because $3$ does not divide the leading coefficient, $3$ divides the other coefficients ($-6$ and $3$), and $3^2 = 9$ does not divide the constant term $3$. Thus, $P(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the roots of $P(x)$\nSince $P(x)$ is irreducible, it has 5 distinct roots. Let's denote these roots as $r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4, r_5$. The Galois group $\\text{Gal}(P/\\mathbb{Q})$ acts on these roots, and since $P(x)$ is irreducible, this action is transitive.\n\n## Step 4: Examine the Galois group of $P(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$\nThe Galois group $\\text{Gal}(P/\\mathbb{Q})$ is a subgroup of $S_5$ because it acts on the 5 roots of $P(x)$. Since $P(x)$ is irreducible, $\\text{Gal}(P/\\mathbb{Q})$ is a transitive subgroup of $S_5$.\n\n## Step 5: Determine if $\\text{Gal}(P/\\mathbb{Q})$ is isomorphic to $S_5$\nTo show that $\\text{Gal}(P/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5$, we need to establish that $\\text{Gal}(P/\\mathbb{Q})$ is the entire $S_5$. For a transitive subgroup of $S_5$ to be $S_5$, it must contain a transposition (since it is known that a transitive subgroup of $S_n$ containing a transposition is $S_n$).\n\n## Step 6: Check for the presence of a transposition in $\\text{Gal}(P/\\mathbb{Q})$\nWe can use the fact that $P(x)$ has 3 real roots and 2 complex roots (since its derivative $P'(x) = 5x^4 - 6$ has 2 real roots, implying $P(x)$ has at most 3 real roots due to Rolle's theorem, and $P(x)$ has an odd degree, so it must have at least one real root). The complex roots must be conjugates of each other. The Galois group contains a transposition if it contains an element that swaps the two complex roots and fixes the real roots. The complex conjugation automorphism is such an element.\n\n## Step 7: Apply Galois's Theorem to conclude about solvability by radicals\nGalois's Theorem states that a polynomial is solvable by radicals if and only if its Galois group is solvable. $S_5$ is not solvable, so if $\\text{Gal}(P/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5$, then $P(x) = 0$ is not solvable by radicals.\n\n## Step 8: Establish that $\\text{Gal}(P/\\mathbb{Q})$ contains a transposition and is thus $S_5$\nSince $P(x)$ has 3 real roots and 2 non-real roots, complex conjugation is an automorphism of the splitting field that fixes $\\mathbb{Q}$ and transposes the two non-real roots. Thus, $\\text{Gal}(P/\\mathbb{Q})$ contains a transposition. Moreover, because $P(x)$ is irreducible, $\\text{Gal}(P/\\mathbb{Q})$ is transitive. A transitive subgroup of $S_5$ that contains a transposition is $S_5$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{S_5}$"

        "question": "### Brouwer's Fixed-Point Theorem from Sperner's Lemma\n\n**Background and Definitions**\n\nThis problem guides you through a celebrated proof in topology, which uses a combinatorial result about labeled graphs to establish a deep property of continuous functions. The goal is to prove **Brouwer's Fixed-Point Theorem** in two dimensions.\n\n1.  **Continuous Functions and Fixed Points:**\n    -   Let $T$ be a closed triangle in the plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$. A function $f: T \\to T$ is **continuous** if, intuitively, it maps nearby points in the domain to nearby points in the codomain.\n    -   A **fixed point** of a function $f$ is a point $x \\in T$ such that $f(x) = x$. Brouwer's theorem states that such a point always exists for any continuous function from a set like $T$ to itself.\n\n2.  **Triangulation:**\n    -   A **triangulation** of a triangle $T$ is a subdivision of $T$ into a finite number of smaller triangles, called *sub-simplices*. This subdivision must satisfy the condition that any two sub-simplices are either disjoint, share exactly one common vertex, or share exactly one common edge.\n\n3.  **Sperner's Lemma:**\n    -   Let the vertices of the main triangle $T$ be $V_1, V_2, V_3$.

Any vertex lying on an edge of the main triangle $T$ must be labeled with one of the labels of the endpoints of that edge.

Vertices in the interior of $T$ can have any label.\n    -   A sub-simplex (a small triangle in the triangulation) is called **trichromatic** if its three vertices are labeled with all three distinct labels: 1, 2, and 3.\n\n**Goal**\n\nYou are to prove the following two statements in order:\n\n1.  **Prove Sperner's Lemma:** Show that every Sperner-labeled triangulation of a triangle contains an odd number of trichromatic sub-simplices.

You may assume that a triangle is a compact set and that continuous functions on compact sets are uniformly continuous.",
        "answer": "## Step 1: Understand Sperner's Lemma and its requirements\nTo prove Sperner's Lemma, we need to show that every Sperner-labeled triangulation of a triangle contains an odd number of trichromatic sub-simplices. A Sperner labeling is defined such that the main vertices of $T$ are labeled distinctly (1, 2, 3), and any vertex on an edge of $T$ is labeled with one of the labels of the endpoints of that edge.\n\n## Step 2: Prove Sperner's Lemma by showing the existence of at least one trichromatic sub-simplex\nWe will prove Sperner's Lemma by considering the number of trichromatic sub-simplices and showing that it is odd. To do this, we can use a parity argument based on the number of edges labeled (1,2) in the triangulation.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the parity argument to prove Sperner's Lemma\nLet's count the number of sub-simplices that have vertices labeled (1,2). For any sub-simplex, if it is trichromatic, it has one edge labeled (1,2); if it is not trichromatic but has vertices labeled (1,2), it has either zero or two such edges. For sub-simplices on the edge between $V_1$ and $V_2$, they have one vertex labeled 1 and one labeled 2, thus contributing one (1,2) edge. The number of (1,2) edges on the edge $V_1V_2$ is odd because the labeling at $V_1$ is 1 and at $V_2$ is 2, and the labeling rule ensures an odd number of switches between 1 and 2 along this edge.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the number of trichromatic triangles using the parity argument\nConsider the number of (1,2) edges across all sub-simplices. Each trichromatic sub-simplex contributes one (1,2) edge. Non-trichromatic sub-simplices either contribute 0 or 2 (1,2) edges. Thus, the total count of (1,2) edges across all sub-simplices is congruent modulo 2 to the number of trichromatic sub-simplices. Since the number of (1,2) edges on the boundary edge $V_1V_2$ is odd, and every (1,2) edge is counted either once (if it's on the boundary) or twice (if it's internal), the total number of trichromatic sub-simplices must be odd to satisfy the parity condition.\n\n## Step 5: Understand Brouwer's Fixed-Point Theorem and its relation to Sperner's Lemma\nBrouwer's Fixed-Point Theorem states that any continuous function $f: T \\to T$ has at least one fixed point. To prove this using Sperner's Lemma, we need to construct a sequence of triangulations with decreasing diameter and apply Sperner's Lemma to each.\n\n## Step 6: Construct a sequence of triangulations and apply Sperner's Lemma\nFor a continuous function $f: T \\to T$, consider a sequence of triangulations of $T$ with the diameter of the sub-simplices approaching 0. Label each vertex $v$ of the triangulation with a label $i$ such that $f(v)$ is \"closest\" to $V_i$ in a certain sense, or more precisely, based on the coordinates or a similar metric that ensures a Sperner labeling.\n\n## Step 7: Apply Sperner's Lemma to the constructed triangulations\nFor each triangulation in the sequence, apply Sperner's Lemma to find a trichromatic sub-simplex. The vertices of this sub-simplex are labeled 1, 2, and 3, corresponding to the vertices $V_1$, $V_2$, and $V_3$ of $T$.\n\n## Step 8: Use the trichromatic sub-simplices to find a fixed point\nAs the diameter of the sub-simplices approaches 0, the trichromatic sub-simplices converge to a point. For each trichromatic sub-simplex, the images of its vertices under $f$ are close to the respective vertices $V_1$, $V_2$, and $V_3$, due to the labeling. By the continuity of $f$ and the compactness of $T$, there exists a subsequence of these points that converges to a fixed point.\n\n## Step 9: Show that the limit point is a fixed point of $f$\nLet $x$ be the limit point of the vertices of the trichromatic sub-simplices. Since $f$ is continuous, $f(x)$ is the limit of $f(v)$ for $v$ approaching $x$. For any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\\delta > 0$ such that $|f(v) - f(x)| < \\epsilon$ whenever $|v - x| < \\delta$. For $v$ being a vertex of a sufficiently fine triangulation, $|v - x|$ is small, and $|f(v) - v|$ is also small because $v$ is labeled based on $f(v)$. Thus, $|f(x) - x|$ is small, implying $f(x) = x$ because $x$ is the limit of points where $|f(v) - v|$ can be made arbitrarily small.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{True}$"

The probability of any specific path that returns to the origin after $2k$ steps is $\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{2k}$ because there are $4$ possible directions for each step.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate $p_{2k}(\\mathbf{0})$\nThe number of ways to choose $k$ steps out of $2k$ to be in one direction (say right) and then $a$ out of $k$ to be right (with the rest, $k-a$, being left), and similarly for up and down, is given by the multinomial coefficient. However, a simpler way to think about it is that to return to the origin, we need an equal number of steps in opposite directions. The probability $p_{2k}(\\mathbf{0})$ can be calculated by considering the number of ways to arrange $k$ pairs of opposite steps (right-left and up-down) out of $2k$ steps. This can be represented as:\n$$ p_{2k}(\\mathbf{0}) = \\binom{2k}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2k} \\cdot \\binom{2k}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2k} $$\nHowever, the correct way to think about $p_{2k}(\\mathbf{0})$ for $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ involves considering the number of ways to have $k$ steps in the $x$-direction and $k$ steps in the $y$-direction, with an equal number of positive and negative steps in each direction. The correct formula involves:\n$$ p_{2k}(\\mathbf{0}) = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{2k} \\sum_{i=0}^{k} \\binom{2k}{i, i, k-i, k-i} $$\nBut a more straightforward approach to calculate $p_{2k}(\\mathbf{0})$ directly uses the fact that:\n$$ p_{2k}(\\mathbf{0}) = \\left(\\binom{2k}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2k}\\right)^2 $$\nbecause the walk can be considered as two independent one-dimensional random walks.\n\n## Step 4: Apply Stirling's approximation to $p_{2k}(\\mathbf{0})$\nUsing Stirling's approximation, $\\binom{2k}{k} \\sim \\frac{4^k}{\\sqrt{\\pi k}}$, we have:\n$$ p_{2k}(\\mathbf{0}) = \\left(\\frac{4^k}{\\sqrt{\\pi k}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4^k}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\pi k} $$\n\n## Step 5: Evaluate the sum $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty p_n(\\mathbf{0})$\nSince $p_n(\\mathbf{0}) = 0$ for odd $n$, we only need to consider $n = 2k$. Thus, the sum becomes:\n$$ \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty p_{2k}(\\mathbf{0}) = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{\\pi k} $$\nThis is a harmonic series, which is known to diverge.\n\n## Step 6: Conclusion on recurrence\nSince $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty p_n(\\mathbf{0}) = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty p_{2k}(\\mathbf{0})$ diverges, the simple symmetric random walk on $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ is recurrent.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{Recurrent}$"

        "answer": "## Step 1: Understand the Problem and Jensen's Formula\nJensen's formula relates the average value of the logarithm of the magnitude of an analytic function on a circle to the logarithm of the magnitude of the function at the center and the locations of its zeros inside the circle. We need to prove that for an analytic function $f(z)$ with zeros $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ inside $D_R$ and no zeros on $|z| = R$, the formula $ \\log|f(0)| + \\sum_{k=1}^n \\log\\left(\\frac{R}{|a_k|}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\log|f(Re^{i\\theta})| \\,d\\theta $ holds.\n\n## Step 2: Define a Helper Function\nTo prove Jensen's formula, we start by defining a function $g(z) = f(z) \\prod_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{R(z - a_k)}{R^2 - \\overline{a_k}z}$. This function is analytic in a region containing $\\overline{D_R}$ because $f(z)$ is analytic and the product is taken over the zeros of $f(z)$ inside $D_R$, ensuring that $g(z)$ has no zeros in $D_R$ due to the construction that removes the zeros of $f(z)$.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the Zeros and Poles of $g(z)$\nThe function $g(z)$ is constructed such that it has no zeros inside $D_R$ because the factors $\\frac{R(z - a_k)}{R^2 - \\overline{a_k}z}$ cancel out the zeros of $f(z)$ at $a_k$. For $|z| = R$, $|g(z)| = |f(z)|$ because $\\left|\\frac{R(z - a_k)}{R^2 - \\overline{a_k}z}\\right| = 1$ when $|z| = R$. This is due to the fact that $|R(z - a_k)| = |R^2 - \\overline{a_k}z|$ when $|z| = R$, as $|R(z - a_k)|^2 = R^2(|z|^2 - 2\\text{Re}(\\overline{z}a_k) + |a_k|^2)$ and $|R^2 - \\overline{a_k}z|^2 = R^4 - 2R^2\\text{Re}(\\overline{a_k}z) + |a_k|^2|z|^2 = R^2(R^2 - 2\\text{Re}(\\overline{a_k}z) + |a_k|^2)$ when $|z| = R$, simplifying to the same expression.\n\n## Step 4: Apply the Mean Value Property to $\\log|g(z)|$\nSince $g(z)$ is analytic and has no zeros in $D_R$, $\\log|g(z)|$ is harmonic in $D_R$.

For example, $31 = 5^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 + 1^2$. This problem asks for a proof of this theorem using tools from the geometry of numbers.\n\nTo make the problem self-contained, we introduce the following concepts and state a major theorem you may use without proof.\n\n1.  **Lattice:** A **lattice** $L$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is a set of points of the form $L = \\{\\sum_{i=1}^n c_i \\mathbf{b}_i \\mid c_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$, where $\\{\\mathbf{b}_1, \\dots, \\mathbf{b}_n\\}$ is a set of linearly independent vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ called the **basis** of the lattice.\n    -   The **fundamental parallelepiped** of the lattice with respect to this basis is the set $P = \\{\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\mathbf{b}_i \\mid 0 \\le x_i < 1\\}$.\n    -   The **volume of the fundamental parallelepiped** is given by $|\\det(B)|$, where $B$ is the matrix whose columns are the basis vectors $\\mathbf{b}_i$.

        "answer": "## Step 1: Understand the Problem and Given Theorems\nThe problem asks us to prove Lagrange's four-square theorem, which states that every positive integer can be represented as the sum of four integer squares, using the geometry of numbers. We are given Minkowski's Convex Body Theorem and Euler's Four-Square Identity as tools to aid in the proof.\n\n## Step 2: Apply Minkowski's Convex Body Theorem\nTo apply Minkowski's Convex Body Theorem, we need to define a lattice $L$ and a convex, centrally symmetric set $K$ in $\\mathbb{R}^4$. For a given positive integer $n$, we consider the lattice $L = \\mathbb{Z}^4$, which has a fundamental parallelepiped of volume $1$ since its basis vectors are the standard basis vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^4$. We need to construct $K$ such that it is related to representing $n$ as a sum of four squares.\n\n## Step 3: Construct the Convex, Centrally Symmetric Set $K$\nLet's define $K = \\{(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4) \\in \\mathbb{R}^4 \\mid x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 < 2n\\}$. This set is convex and centrally symmetric because it is defined by a quadratic form that is positive definite, and it is symmetric with respect to the origin. The volume of $K$ can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a sphere in $\\mathbb{R}^4$, which is $\\frac{\\pi^2 r^4}{2}$, where $r$ is the radius. Here, $r = \\sqrt{2n}$, so $\\text{vol}(K) = \\frac{\\pi^2 (\\sqrt{2n})^4}{2} = 2\\pi^2 n^2$.\n\n## Step 4: Check if $K$ Satisfies Minkowski's Convex Body Theorem\nThe volume of the fundamental parallelepiped of $L = \\mathbb{Z}^4$ is $1$. According to Minkowski's Convex Body Theorem, if $\\text{vol}(K) > 2^4 = 16$, then $K$ contains a non-zero lattice point. So, we check if $2\\pi^2 n^2 > 16$. Simplifying, we get $\\pi^2 n^2 > 8$, or $n^2 > \\frac{8}{\\pi^2}$. Since $\\frac{8}{\\pi^2} < 1$, for any $n \\geq 1$, $n^2 > \\frac{8}{\\pi^2}$, and thus $2\\pi^2 n^2 > 16$ for $n \\geq 1$. This implies $K$ contains a lattice point other than $\\mathbf{0}$.\n\n## Step 5: Interpret the Result of Minkowski's Theorem\nFor any positive integer $n$, there exists a lattice point $(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^4$ such that $0 < a_1^2 + a_2^2 + a_3^2 + a_4^2 < 2n$. This is because $K$ contains a non-zero lattice point, implying there are integers $a_i$ not all zero such that $a_1^2 + a_2^2 + a_3^2 + a_4^2 < 2n$.\n\n## Step 6: Use Euler's Four-Square Identity to Generalize\nEuler's Four-Square Identity tells us that the product of two numbers, each of which is a sum of four squares, is itself a sum of four squares. To prove that every positive integer $n$ can be represented as a sum of four squares, we first observe that for any prime $p$, we can find $a_i$ such that $a_1^2 + a_2^2 + a_3^2 + a_4^2 = p$ or $a_1^2 + a_2^2 + a_3^2 + a_4^2 = mp$ where $m < p$ (by Step 5, adjusting $n$ to $p/2$ or slightly less if $p$ is odd, and using $n=1$ for $p=2$). For $p=2$, it's straightforward as $2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2$. For odd primes, applying Step 5 with $n = p/2$ (and considering the integer part if $p$ is odd) shows that there are integers $a_i$ such that $0 < a_1^2 + a_2^2 + a_3^2 + a_4^2 < p$, and by adjusting, we can get $a_1^2 + a_2^2 + a_3^2 + a_4^2 = mp$ where $m < p$. Repeatedly applying this and using Euler's identity, we can reduce any $n$ to be represented as a sum of four squares.\n\n## Step 7: Finalize the Proof for All Positive Integers\nSince $1 = 1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 + 0^2$ is a sum of four squares, and we've established that primes can be represented as a sum of four squares, using Euler's Four-Square Identity, we can conclude that any product of primes (and thus any positive integer, since every positive integer can be factored into primes) can be represented as a sum of four squares.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$"
