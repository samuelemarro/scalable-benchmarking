    "question": "The following problem addresses the intersection of Model Theory and Computability Theory, specifically concerning the properties of models of Peano Arithmetic.\n\n\n**Problem Statement**\n\nLet $\\mathcal{L} = \\{+, \\times, <, 0, 1\\}$ be the language of arithmetic. Let $PA$ denote the first-order theory of Peano Arithmetic.\n\nA structure $\\mathcal{M} = (D, +^\\mathcal{M}, \\times^\\mathcal{M}, <^\\mathcal{M}, 0^\\mathcal{M}, 1^\\mathcal{M})$ is defined to be a **computable model** if:\n1. The domain $D$ is the set of natural numbers $\\mathbb{N}$.\n2. The operations $+^\\mathcal{M}: \\mathbb{N} \\times \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}$ and $\\times^\\mathcal{M}: \\mathbb{N} \\times \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}$ are computable (recursive) functions.\n3. The relation $<^\\mathcal{M} \\subseteq \\mathbb{N} \\times \\mathbb{N}$ is a computable (recursive) relation.\n\nProve that there are no computable non-standard models of $PA$.

        "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to show that if $\\mathcal{M}$ is a computable model of Peano Arithmetic (PA), then $\\mathcal{M}$ must be isomorphic to the standard model $\\mathcal{N} = (\\mathbb{N}, +, \\times, <, 0, 1)$. In other words, there cannot exist a computable non-standard model of PA.\n\n### Key Concepts and Assumptions\n\n1. **Standard Model of PA**: The standard model $\\mathcal{N}$ consists of the natural numbers $\\mathbb{N}$ with the usual addition, multiplication, and order.\n\n2. **Non-standard Model**: A non-standard model of PA is a model that satisfies the axioms of PA but has elements that are not natural numbers (i.e., it has \"infinite\" or \"non-standard\" elements).\n\n3. **Computable Model**: A model $\\mathcal{M}$ is computable if its domain is $\\mathbb{N}$, and the operations and relations are computable functions and relations.\n\n4. **Recursively Enumerable Sets**: A set is recursively enumerable (r.e.) if there is a Turing machine that lists its elements. A set is recursive if both it and its complement are r.e.\n\n5. **Recursively Inseparable Sets**: Two disjoint r.e. sets $A$ and $B$ are recursively inseparable if there is no recursive set $C$ such that $A \\subseteq C$ and $B \\cap C = \\emptyset$.\n\n### Proof Outline\n\n1. **Assume $\\mathcal{M}$ is a computable model of PA**: This means the domain is $\\mathbb{N}$, and the operations and relations are computable.\n\n2. **Non-standard Models and Recursively Enumerable Sets**: Non-standard models of PA have elements that correspond to non-standard integers. These models can define sets that are not recursive, such as the set of standard natural numbers within the model.\n\n3. **Standard System of a Model**: For any model $\\mathcal{M}$ of PA, the standard system is the collection of sets of natural numbers that are definable in $\\mathcal{M}$ with parameters from $\\mathcal{M}$. In a non-standard model, the standard system includes non-recursive sets.\n\n4. **Recursive Inseparability**: If $\\mathcal{M}$ is a non-standard model, it can define two disjoint r.e. sets that are recursively inseparable. However, if $\\mathcal{M}$ is computable, it cannot define such sets because the operations and relations are recursive, contradicting the existence of recursively inseparable sets.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since a computable model cannot define recursively inseparable sets, it cannot be non-standard. Therefore, any computable model of PA must be isomorphic to the standard model $\\mathcal{N}$.\n\n### Detailed Proof\n\nAssume for contradiction that there exists a computable non-standard model $\\mathcal{M}$ of PA. In such a model, we can define the set of standard natural numbers, which is an initial segment of the model. This set is not recursive because it would require distinguishing between standard and non-standard elements, which is not possible with a recursive set.\n\nHowever, in a computable model, all definable sets must be recursive because the operations and relations are computable. This leads to a contradiction because the set of standard natural numbers is not recursive in a non-standard model.\n\nTherefore, no computable non-standard model of PA can exist, and any computable model of PA must be isomorphic to the standard model $\\mathcal{N}$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThere are no computable non-standard models of Peano Arithmetic. If $\\mathcal{M}$ is a computable model of PA, then $\\mathcal{M}$ is isomorphic to the standard model $\\mathcal{N} = (\\mathbb{N}, +, \\times, <, 0, 1)$.",

It correctly uses concepts from computability theory and model theory to demonstrate that a computable model of PA must be isomorphic to the standard model. The explanation of recursively inseparable sets and their role in distinguishing standard from non-standard models is particularly well done. No significant improvements are necessary."

Specifically, the difference between consecutive cubes $y^3$ and $(y+1)^3$ is $3y^2 + 3y + 1$, which grows rapidly.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only integer solutions $(x, y)$ to the equation $x^2 + 7 = y^3$ are:\n\n$$\n(x, y) = (1, 2) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad (x, y) = (-1, 2)\n$$",
