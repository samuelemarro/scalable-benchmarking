Then, there exists $b(x) + I$ such that $(a(x) + I)(b(x) + I) = 1 + I$. This implies that $a(x)b(x) - 1 \\in I$. Since $I$ is generated by $x^4 - 2$, we have $a(x)b(x) - 1 = q(x)(x^4 - 2)$ for some $q(x) \\in R$.\n\nTherefore, the elements $a(x) + I$ in $Q$ that are units are those for which there exists $b(x) \\in R$ such that $a(x)b(x) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{I}$.\n\nTo find the order of the group of units of $Q$, we need to determine the number of units in $Q$.

If $xy - zw = 0$ in $R$, then $xy = zw$. This implies that $x$ divides $zw$ in $\\mathbb{C}[x, y, z, w]$. Since $\\mathbb{C}[x, y, z, w]$ is a UFD (unique factorization domain), this means $x$ divides either $z$ or $w$. Without loss of generality, assume $x$ divides $z$. Then we can write $z = xq$ for some $q \\in \\mathbb{C}[x, y, z, w]$.\n\nSubstituting $z = xq$ back into $xy = zw$, we get $xy = xwq$, which simplifies to $y = wq$. This implies that $y$ divides $w$ in $\\mathbb{C}[x, y, z, w]$, which is a contradiction since $y$ and $w$ are algebraically independent.

This means there exists a monic polynomial $f(t) = t^n + r_{n-1}t^{n-1} + \\ldots + r_0 \\in R[t]$ such that $f(a) = 0$.

Since $a$ is integral over $R$, $m_a(t)$ must be in $R[t]$. This implies that $a$ is a root of $m_a(t)$ in $R$.

The complex tangent space $T_p^{1,0}(\\partial \\Omega)$ at $p$ is spanned by the vectors $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$ and $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial w}$.\n\nThe Levi form matrix $L_p$ is calculated as follows:\n$$L_p = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\rho}{\\partial z \\partial \\bar{z}} & \\frac{\\partial^2 \\rho}{\\partial z \\partial \\bar{w}} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial^2 \\rho}{\\partial w \\partial \\bar{z}} & \\frac{\\partial^2 \\rho}{\\partial w \\partial \\bar{w}} \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nWe first compute the second partial derivatives of $\\rho$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial z} = 2z, \\quad \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial w} = 4w^3$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 \\rho}{\\partial z \\partial \\bar{z}} = 2, \\quad \\frac{\\partial^2 \\rho}{\\partial z \\partial \\bar{w}} = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial^2 \\rho}{\\partial w \\partial \\bar{z}} = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial^2 \\rho}{\\partial w \\partial \\bar{w}} = 12w^2$$\n\nTherefore, the Levi form matrix $L_p$ at $p = (z_0, w_0)$ is:\n$$L_p = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 12w_0^2 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\n### Part 2: Determine the set $S$ where the boundary is not strictly pseudoconvex\n\nFor a domain to be strictly pseudoconvex, the Levi form must be positive definite. In this case, for $\\partial \\Omega$ to be strictly pseudoconvex, the Levi form matrix $L_p$ must have all positive eigenvalues for all $p \\in \\partial \\Omega$.\n\nSince $L_p$ is diagonal, the eigenvalues are the diagonal entries. For $\\partial \\Omega$ to be strictly pseudoconvex, we need $2 > 0$ and $12w_0^2 > 0$. This implies $w_0 \\neq 0$.\n\nTherefore, the set $S$ where the boundary $\\partial \\Omega$ is not strictly pseudoconvex is the set of points where $w = 0$, i.e., $S = \\{(z, 0) : |z|^2 < 1\\}$.\n\n### Part 3: Prove that $\\Omega$ is not biholomorphically equivalent to $\\mathbb{B}^2$\n\nTo prove that $\\Omega$ is not biholomorphically equivalent to $\\mathbb{B}^2$, we will show that they have different pseudoconvexity properties.\n\n$\\Omega$ is not strictly pseudoconvex along the set $S = \\{(z, 0) : |z|^2 < 1\\}$ as shown in Part 2. On the other hand, $\\mathbb{B}^2$ is strictly pseudoconvex everywhere on its boundary $\\partial \\mathbb{B}^2$.\n\nAssume there exists a biholomorphic map $f: \\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{B}^2$. By the given fact, this map extends to a smooth diffeomorphism of their closures, denoted as $\\overline{f}: \\overline{\\Omega} \\rightarrow \\overline{\\mathbb{B}^2}$.\n\nSince $\\overline{f}$ is a diffeomorphism, it preserves the pseudoconvexity property. However, $\\Omega$ and $\\mathbb{B}^2$ have different pseudoconvexity properties, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, $\\Omega$ is not biholomorphically equivalent to $\\mathbb{B}^2$.",

The complex tangent space $T_p^{1,0}(\\partial \\Omega)$ at $p$ is spanned by the vectors $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$ and $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial w}$.\n\nThe Levi form matrix $L_p$ is calculated as follows:\n$$L_p = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\rho}{\\partial z \\partial \\bar{z}} & \\frac{\\partial^2 \\rho}{\\partial z \\partial \\bar{w}} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial^2 \\rho}{\\partial w \\partial \\bar{z}} & \\frac{\\partial^2 \\rho}{\\partial w \\partial \\bar{w}} \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nWe first compute the second partial derivatives of $\\rho$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial z} = 2z, \\quad \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial w} = 4w^3$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 \\rho}{\\partial z \\partial \\bar{z}} = 2, \\quad \\frac{\\partial^2 \\rho}{\\partial z \\partial \\bar{w}} = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial^2 \\rho}{\\partial w \\partial \\bar{z}} = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial^2 \\rho}{\\partial w \\partial \\bar{w}} = 12w^2$$\n\nTherefore, the Levi form matrix $L_p$ at $p = (z_0, w_0)$ is:\n$$L_p = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 12w_0^2 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\n### Part 2: Determine the set $S$ where the boundary is not strictly pseudoconvex\n\nFor a domain to be strictly pseudoconvex, the Levi form must be positive definite. In this case, for $\\partial \\Omega$ to be strictly pseudoconvex, the Levi form matrix $L_p$ must have all positive eigenvalues for all $p \\in \\partial \\Omega$.\n\nSince $L_p$ is diagonal, the eigenvalues are the diagonal entries. For $\\partial \\Omega$ to be strictly pseudoconvex, we need $2 > 0$ and $12w_0^2 > 0$. This implies $w_0 \\neq 0$.\n\nTherefore, the set $S$ where the boundary $\\partial \\Omega$ is not strictly pseudoconvex is the set of points where $w = 0$, i.e., $S = \\{(z, 0) : |z|^2 < 1\\}$.\n\n### Part 3: Prove that $\\Omega$ is not biholomorphically equivalent to $\\mathbb{B}^2$\n\nTo prove that $\\Omega$ is not biholomorphically equivalent to $\\mathbb{B}^2$, we will show that they have different pseudoconvexity properties.\n\n$\\Omega$ is not strictly pseudoconvex along the set $S = \\{(z, 0) : |z|^2 < 1\\}$ as shown in Part 2. On the other hand, $\\mathbb{B}^2$ is strictly pseudoconvex everywhere on its boundary $\\partial \\mathbb{B}^2$.\n\nAssume there exists a biholomorphic map $f: \\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{B}^2$. By the given fact, this map extends to a smooth diffeomorphism of their closures, denoted as $\\overline{f}: \\overline{\\Omega} \\rightarrow \\overline{\\mathbb{B}^2}$.\n\nSince $\\overline{f}$ is a diffeomorphism, it preserves the pseudoconvexity property. However, $\\Omega$ and $\\mathbb{B}^2$ have different pseudoconvexity properties, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, $\\Omega$ is not biholomorphically equivalent to $\\mathbb{B}^2$.",

For $X(x)$:\n$$ X''(x) - 2X'(x) + \\lambda X(x) = 0 $$\n\nThe characteristic equation for this is $r^2 - 2r + \\lambda = 0$, which has roots $r = 1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - \\lambda}$.\n\nThe general solution for $X(x)$ is then:\n$$ X(x) = c_2 e^{(1 + \\sqrt{1 - \\lambda})x} + c_3 e^{(1 - \\sqrt{1 - \\lambda})x} $$\n\nApplying the boundary condition $u(0, t) = 1$ for $t > 0$, we get:\n$$ X(0)T(t) = c_2 + c_3 = 1 $$\n\nApplying the initial condition $u(x, 0) = 0$ for $x > 0$, we get:\n$$ X(x)T(0) = c_2 e^{(1 + \\sqrt{1 - \\lambda})x} + c_3 e^{(1 - \\sqrt{1 - \\lambda})x} = 0 $$\n\nThis implies $c_2 = -c_3$ and $c_2 = c_3 = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the partial differential equation is:\n$$ u(x, t) = \\frac{1}{2} e^{(1 + \\sqrt{1 - \\lambda})x} e^{-\\lambda t} + \\frac{1}{2} e^{(1 - \\sqrt{1 - \\lambda})x} e^{-\\lambda t} $$\n\nTo satisfy the boundary condition $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} u(x, t) = 0$ for $t > 0$, we need $\\lambda > 1$.\n\nThe complementary error function is defined as:\n$$ \\text{erfc}(z) = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\int_z^\\infty e^{-\\eta^2} \\, d\\eta $$\n\nTherefore, the exact solution to the given initial-boundary value problem is:\n$$ u(x, t) = \\frac{1}{2} e^{(1 + \\sqrt{1 - \\lambda})x} e^{-\\lambda t} + \\frac{1}{2} e^{(1 - \\sqrt{1 - \\lambda})x} e^{-\\lambda t} = \\frac{1}{2} e^{x + \\sqrt{\\lambda - 1}x} e^{-\\lambda t} + \\frac{1}{2} e^{x - \\sqrt{\\lambda - 1}x} e^{-\\lambda t} = \\frac{1}{2} e^{x} e^{\\sqrt{\\lambda - 1}x} e^{-\\lambda t} + \\frac{1}{2} e^{x} e^{-\\sqrt{\\lambda - 1}x} e^{-\\lambda t} = e^{x} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} e^{\\sqrt{\\lambda - 1}x} + \\frac{1}{2} e^{-\\sqrt{\\lambda - 1}x} \\right) e^{-\\lambda t} = e^{x} \\cosh(\\sqrt{\\lambda - 1}x) e^{-\\lambda t} = e^{x} \\cosh\\left(\\sqrt{\\lambda - 1}x - \\lambda t\\right) $$\n\nTherefore, the exact solution to the given initial-boundary value problem is $u(x, t) = e^{x} \\cosh\\left(\\sqrt{\\lambda - 1}x - \\lambda t\\right)$, where $\\lambda > 1$.",

Substituting this into the equation for $n \\geq 2$, we obtain:\n$$x_{n-1} + (\\lambda + 2)x_n + (-1)^n x_n = \\lambda x_n.$$\nRearranging terms, we get:\n$$x_{n-1} = (\\lambda - 1)x_n - (-1)^n x_n.$$\n\nThis recursive relation allows us to express $x_{n-1}$ in terms of $x_n$. Let's define $y_n = x_{n+1}$. Then, the recursive relation for $y_n$ becomes:\n$$y_n = (\\lambda - 1)x_{n+1} - (-1)^{n+1} x_{n+1} = (\\lambda + (-1)^n - 1)y_{n-1}.$$\n\nStarting from $y_2$, we can recursively determine all $y_n$ in terms of $x_1$ and $\\lambda$. Solving these recursive relations completely will yield the eigenvalues $\\lambda$ corresponding to the point spectrum $\\sigma_p(T)$.",

        "raw_answer": "**Part 1:**\n\nTo determine the exact set of values for $\\alpha$ such that the Jacobi iterative method converges for any initial guess $x^{(0)}$, we need to analyze the spectral radius of the iteration matrix for the Jacobi method.\n\nThe iteration matrix for the Jacobi method is given by $M = D^{-1}(L + U)$, where $A = D - L - U$ is the decomposition of $A$ into its diagonal $D$, strictly lower triangular $L$, and strictly upper triangular $U$ parts.\n\nFor the tridiagonal matrix $A$ given in the question, we have:\n$$D = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad L = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \\alpha & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\alpha & 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad U = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\alpha & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\alpha \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}.$$\n\nTherefore, the iteration matrix $M$ is:\n$$M = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -\\frac{\\alpha}{2} & 0 \\\\ -\\frac{\\alpha}{2} & 0 & -\\frac{\\alpha}{2} \\\\ 0 & -\\frac{\\alpha}{2} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}.$$\n\nThe spectral radius of $M$ is given by the maximum absolute eigenvalue of $M$.
