        "answer": "## Step 1: Understand the Problem Statement\nThe problem asks us to prove that there are no computable non-standard models of Peano Arithmetic ($PA$). A computable model $\\mathcal{M}$ of $PA$ is a structure with domain $\\mathbb{N}$, where the operations $+$ and $\\times$, and the relation $<$ are computable. We need to show that any such $\\mathcal{M}$ is isomorphic to the standard model $\\mathcal{N} = (\\mathbb{N}, +, \\times, <, 0, 1)$.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the Definition of Peano Arithmetic and Its Models\nPeano Arithmetic is a first-order theory that axiomatizes the properties of natural numbers. A model of $PA$ is a structure that satisfies all the axioms of $PA$. The standard model $\\mathcal{N}$ is the structure $(\\mathbb{N}, +, \\times, <, 0, 1)$, where $\\mathbb{N}$ is the set of natural numbers, and $+$, $\\times$, and $<$ are the usual addition, multiplication, and less-than relations, respectively.\n\n## Step 3: Understand Computable Models\nA computable model $\\mathcal{M}$ has $\\mathbb{N}$ as its domain, and its operations and relations are computable. This means there are algorithms (Turing machines) that can compute $+^\\mathcal{M}$, $\\times^\\mathcal{M}$, and decide $<^\\mathcal{M}$.\n\n## Step 4: Establish the Isomorphism Between $\\mathcal{M}$ and $\\mathcal{N}$\nTo prove $\\mathcal{M}$ is isomorphic to $\\mathcal{N}$, we need to show there exists a bijection $f: \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}$ that preserves the operations and relations. That is, $f(a +^\\mathcal{M} b) = f(a) + f(b)$, $f(a \\times^\\mathcal{M} b) = f(a) \\times f(b)$, and $a <^\\mathcal{M} b$ if and only if $f(a) < f(b)$.\n\n## Step 5: Utilize the Properties of $PA$ to Show $\\mathcal{M}$ is Standard\nSince $\\mathcal{M}$ is a model of $PA$, it satisfies all the axioms of $PA$, including the induction schema. For any $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, let $\\underline{n}$ denote the $n$th numeral in $\\mathcal{M}$ (i.e., $1^\\mathcal{M} +^\\mathcal{M} 1^\\mathcal{M} +^\\mathcal{M} \\cdots +^\\mathcal{M} 1^\\mathcal{M}$, $n$ times). By the axioms of $PA$, every element in $\\mathcal{M}$ is either $0^\\mathcal{M}$ or a successor of some element. For a computable model, we can effectively determine the \"standard\" elements by checking if they are equal to $\\underline{n}$ for some $n$.\n\n## Step 6: Prove That Every Element in $\\mathcal{M}$ is $\\underline{n}$ for Some $n$\nAssume there is an element $a \\in \\mathcal{M}$ such that $a \\neq \\underline{n}$ for all $n$. Then, $a$ is non-standard. We can use the fact that $\\mathcal{M}$ is computable to effectively compare $a$ with $\\underline{n}$ for any $n$. Since $PA$ proves that every number is either less than, equal to, or greater than any given number, and $\\mathcal{M}$ is a model of $PA$, for any $n$, either $a <^\\mathcal{M} \\underline{n}$, $a = \\underline{n}$, or $a >^\\mathcal{M} \\underline{n}$. If $a$ is non-standard, then for all $n$, $a >^\\mathcal{M} \\underline{n}$ because $a$ cannot be equal to $\\underline{n}$ for any $n$ and must be greater than all standard numerals.\n\n## Step 7: Show That the Existence of a Non-Standard Element Leads to a Contradiction\nConsider the set $S = \\{n \\in \\mathbb{N} : \\underline{n} <^\\mathcal{M} a\\}$. Since $\\mathcal{M}$ is computable, $S$ is recursively enumerable because we can list out the elements of $S$ by checking for each $n$ whether $\\underline{n} <^\\mathcal{M} a$. For a non-standard $a$, $S = \\mathbb{N}$, implying that $\\mathbb{N}$ is recursively enumerable, which is trivially true but not directly useful. However, the key insight is that if $\\mathcal{M}$ is non-standard, there exists a non-standard element $a$, and we can define a set based on the comparison of elements with $a$. The crucial step involves showing that the computability of $\\mathcal{M}$ and the properties of $PA$ lead to a contradiction when assuming a non-standard model.\n\n## Step 8: Apply Tennenbaum's Theorem\nTennenbaum's Theorem states that any countable non-standard model of $PA$ has non-computable $+$ and $\\times$. This directly implies that a computable model of $PA$ must be standard because if it were non-standard, its operations would not be computable, contradicting the assumption.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\mathcal{N}}$",

        "answer": "## Step 1: Understand the Problem\nThe problem asks us to find the number of perfect matchings in the complete graph $K_{2n}$ that do not contain any edge belonging to the Hamiltonian cycle $C_{2n}$. $K_{2n}$ has $2n$ vertices, and a perfect matching in $K_{2n}$ is a set of $n$ edges such that every vertex is incident to exactly one edge in the set.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the Total Number of Perfect Matchings in $K_{2n}$\nThe total number of perfect matchings in $K_{2n}$ can be calculated using the formula for the number of perfect matchings in a complete graph, which is given by $\\frac{(2n)!}{2^n \\cdot n!}$, because there are $(2n)!$ ways to arrange the $2n$ vertices into pairs, and we divide by $2^n$ to account for the fact that the order within each pair does not matter, and by $n!$ because the order of the $n$ pairs does not matter.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion to Count Perfect Matchings Without Edges of $C_{2n}$\nTo count the perfect matchings that do not contain any edge of $C_{2n}$, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The principle states that for a set of $n$ elements and a set of properties (in this case, being an edge in $C_{2n}$), the number of elements that satisfy none of the properties is given by the sum of the number of elements that satisfy none, one, two, etc., of the properties, with appropriate signs.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the Number of Perfect Matchings That Contain At Least One Edge of $C_{2n}$\nLet's consider the number of perfect matchings that contain at least one edge of $C_{2n}$. The edges of $C_{2n}$ are $(1,2), (2,3), \\dots, (2n,1)$. For any edge $(i, i+1)$ (with $2n+1 \\equiv 1$), if it is included in a perfect matching, the vertices $i$ and $i+1$ are matched, leaving $2n-2$ vertices to be matched.\n\n## Step 5: Apply Inclusion-Exclusion\nThe number of perfect matchings that do not contain any edge of $C_{2n}$ can be found by applying the principle of inclusion-exclusion. We start with the total number of perfect matchings and subtract the number that contain at least one edge of $C_{2n}$.\n\nFor a perfect matching to contain $k$ specific edges of $C_{2n}$, we first choose $k$ edges out of the $2n$ edges of $C_{2n}$, which can be done in $\\binom{2n}{k}$ ways. For each such choice, the $2k$ vertices associated with these edges are matched, leaving $2n-2k$ vertices. The number of ways to perfectly match the remaining $2n-2k$ vertices is $\\frac{(2n-2k)!}{2^{n-k} \\cdot (n-k)!}$.\n\n## Step 6: Derive the Formula Using Inclusion-Exclusion\nThe number of perfect matchings containing at least one edge of $C_{2n}$ can be calculated by considering the number of matchings that contain exactly $k$ edges of $C_{2n}$ for $k = 1, 2, \\dots, n$, and applying inclusion-exclusion. The formula becomes:\n$$ \\sum_{k=0}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{2n}{k} \\frac{(2n-2k)!}{2^{n-k} \\cdot (n-k)!} $$\nThis formula counts the number of perfect matchings that do not contain any edge of $C_{2n}$ by starting with the total ($k=0$) and then adjusting for the cases where $k$ edges are included.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the Expression\nThe expression we derived is already in a summation form. Let's simplify it:\n$$ \\sum_{k=0}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{2n}{k} \\frac{(2n-2k)!}{2^{n-k} \\cdot (n-k)!} $$\nThis is the number of perfect matchings that do not contain any edge of $C_{2n}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\sum_{k=0}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{2n}{k} \\frac{(2n-2k)!}{2^{n-k} \\cdot (n-k)!}}$",

This form suggests we are looking for a difference between a perfect cube and a perfect square that equals 7.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the equation modulo 7 to simplify the problem\nTo simplify the analysis, we can examine the equation modulo 7. For any integer $x$, $x^2 \\mod 7$ can be 0, 1, 2, or 4 because:\n- $0^2 = 0$\n- $1^2 = 1$, $6^2 = 36 \\equiv 1 \\mod 7$\n- $2^2 = 4$, $5^2 = 25 \\equiv 4 \\mod 7$\n- $3^2 = 9 \\equiv 2 \\mod 7$, $4^2 = 16 \\equiv 2 \\mod 7$\nThus, $x^2 \\equiv 0, 1, 2, \\text{ or } 4 \\mod 7$.\n\n## Step 4: Examine $y^3 \\mod 7$ to further simplify the equation\nFor any integer $y$, $y^3 \\mod 7$ can be 0, 1, or 6 because:\n- $y^3 \\equiv 0 \\mod 7$ if $y \\equiv 0 \\mod 7$\n- $y^3 \\equiv 1 \\mod 7$ if $y \\equiv 1 \\mod 7$\n- $y^3 \\equiv 6 \\mod 7$ if $y \\equiv 6 \\mod 7$\n- For other values of $y \\mod 7$, we can check: $2^3 = 8 \\equiv 1 \\mod 7$, $3^3 = 27 \\equiv 6 \\mod 7$, $4^3 = 64 \\equiv 1 \\mod 7$, $5^3 = 125 \\equiv 6 \\mod 7$\nSo, $y^3 \\equiv 0, 1, \\text{ or } 6 \\mod 7$.\n\n## Step 5: Apply modulo 7 to the original equation\nSubstituting $x^2 + 7 = y^3$ into modulo 7, we get $x^2 \\equiv y^3 \\mod 7$ because $7 \\equiv 0 \\mod 7$.

But $0^2 + 7 = 7 \\neq 0^3 = 0$, so $y = 0$ is not a solution.\nIf $y \\equiv 1 \\mod 7$, then $x^2 \\equiv 1 \\mod 7$, which is possible. Let's check small values of $y$ that are $1 \\mod 7$.\n\n## Step 8: Check small values of $y$ to find integer solutions\nLet's start checking with small $y$:\n- For $y = 2$, $y^3 = 8$, so $x^2 = 1$, giving $x = \\pm1$. Thus, $(x, y) = (\\pm1, 2)$ are solutions.\n\n## Step 9: Continue checking larger $y$ values\nFor larger $y$, we need to check if there are other $y$ that satisfy the equation. Let's examine $y = 3$ and beyond.\n\n## Step 10: Checking $y = 3$ and other nearby values\nFor $y = 3$, $y^3 = 27$, so $x^2 = 20$, which is not a perfect square.\n\n## Step 11: Systematic check for larger $y$\nAs $y$ increases, the difference between consecutive cubes increases, making it less likely to find a perfect square close to $y^3 - 7$. We should check a few more values systematically.\n\n## Step 12: Checking the case for $y = 1$ and $y = -1$ to $y = -3$ and beyond if necessary\nFor $y = 1$, $x^2 = -6$, which has no real solution.\nFor negative $y$, since $y^3$ is negative, $x^2 = y^3 - 7$ will be negative, hence no real $x$.\n\n## Step 13: Checking specific cases around small $y$\nLet's directly check some small positive and negative $y$ values to see if any pattern or solution emerges.\n\n## Step 14: Evaluating the equation for $y = 2$ and other small positive integers\nWe've already found $y = 2$ gives a solution. Let's check a few more positive $y$:\n- For $y = 3$, $x^2 = 20$, not a solution.\n- For $y = 4$, $y^3 = 64$, $x^2 = 57$, not a perfect square.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(\\pm1, 2)}$",

Checking larger $y$ (positive or negative) does not yield additional integer solutions due to the nature of the equation and the growth rates of $x^2$ and $y^3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(\\pm1, 2)}$",
