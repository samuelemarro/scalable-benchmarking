Consistency via the Compactness Theorem\n\nLet $\\Delta$ be an arbitrary finite subset of $T$. If $\\Delta$ contains no extension axioms, any finite graph (e.g. a single vertex with no loop) satisfies the two graph axioms and is a model of $\\Delta$. Otherwise, let $S=\\{(m_i,n_i)\\}$ be the set of pairs appearing in the extension axioms of $\\Delta$, and set\n$$\nk=\\max\\{\\,m_i+n_i\\mid (m_i,n_i)\\in S\\,\\}.\n$$\nWe will construct a finite graph $G$ that satisfies all sentences in $\\Delta$.\n\n**Claim.** For every $N$ sufficiently large there exists a (simple undirected) graph on $N$ vertices with the following property $P_k$:\n\n> For every pair of disjoint vertex sets $U,V$ with $|U|+|V|\\le k$ there exists a vertex $z\\notin U\\cup V$ such that $z$ is adjacent to all vertices of $U$ and to none of $V$.\n\n*Proof of the claim.* Consider the Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi random graph on $N$ labelled vertices where each unordered pair $\\{x,y\\}$ is independently an edge with probability $1/2$. This distribution produces only simple undirected graphs, so the two graph axioms are automatically satisfied.\n\nFix a disjoint pair $(U,V)$ with total size $s=|U|+|V|$ ($1\\le s\\le k$). For a vertex $z$ outside $U\\cup V$ the probability that $z$ has the required adjacency pattern is $2^{-s}$ (edges to $U$ must be present, edges to $V$ absent, all independent). The events for different $z$ are independent, so the probability that *no* such $z$ exists among the $N-s$ candidates is $(1-2^{-s})^{N-s}$.\n\nThe number of choices for $(U,V)$ with total size $s$ is at most $\\binom{N}{s}2^s$: first choose an $s$-element set $S$, then split it into $U$ and $V$. By the union bound, the probability that the random graph fails to have property $P_k$ is at most\n$$\n\\sum_{s=1}^{k}\\binom{N}{s}2^s\\,(1-2^{-s})^{N-s}.\n$$\nFor each fixed $s$, $\\binom{N}{s}2^s$ grows polynomially in $N$, while $(1-2^{-s})^{N-s}$ decays exponentially. Hence for $N$ large enough the whole sum is $<1$, i.e. there is a positive probability that the graph *does* satisfy $P_k$. Consequently such a graph exists. $\\square$\n\nTake such a graph $G$ on $N$ vertices with property $P_k$. It satisfies the two graph axioms by construction. For any extension axiom in $\\Delta$ with parameters $(m,n)$ we have $m+n\\le k$. Given any distinct vertices $u_1,\\dots,u_m,v_1,\\dots,v_n$, set $U=\\{u_i\\}$, $V=\\{v_j\\}$. By $P_k$ there exists a vertex $z\\notin U\\cup V$ with $E(z,u_i)$ for all $i$ and $\\neg E(z,v_j)$ for all $j$. Thus the axiom holds in $G$. Therefore $G$ is a model of $\\Delta$.\n\nSince every finite subset $\\Delta\\subseteq T$ has a model, the Compactness Theorem implies that $T$ itself has a model.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Existence of a countable model\n\nThe theory $T$ is countable (the language is countable and there are countably many extension axioms). From part\u202f1 we know that $T$ is consistent, so it possesses a model $M$.\n\n**$M$ is infinite.** Assume, for contradiction, that $M$ is finite of cardinality $N$. The extension axiom with $m=N$, $n=0$ belongs to $T$. Interpreted in $M$, it says: for any distinct $u_1,\\dots,u_N$ there exists a vertex $z$ distinct from all of them. Taking the $u_i$ to be all elements of $M$ (they are distinct) forces the existence of an element outside $M$, which is impossible. Hence $M$ must be infinite.\n\nBy the Downward L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem Theorem (for a countable first\u2011order theory with an infinite model) there exists a countable model of $T$. (Explicitly, one can take a countable elementary substructure of $M$.) Thus $T$ has a countable model.\n\n---\n\n### 3. $\\aleph_0$-categoricity: any two countable models are isomorphic\n\nLet $G$ and $H$ be two countable models of $T$. Enumerate their vertex sets:\n$$\nG=\\{a_i\\mid i\\in\\mathbb N\\},\\qquad H=\\{b_i\\mid i\\in\\mathbb N\\}.\n$$\n\nA *partial isomorphism* is a bijection $p\\colon A\\to B$ where $A\\subseteq G$, $B\\subseteq H$ are finite and for all $x,y\\in A$,\n$$\nE_G(x,y)\\;\\leftrightarrow\\;E_H(p(x),p(y)).\n$$\n\n**Forth Lemma.** Let $p\\colon A\\to B$ be a partial isomorphism and let $a\\in G\\setminus A$.

Set $U'=p(U)$, $V'=p(V)$; these are disjoint finite subsets of $H$ because $p$ is injective. Since $H\\models T$, the extension axiom with parameters $m=|U'|$, $n=|V'|$ holds. Applying it to the distinct elements of $U'$ and $V'$ yields a vertex $b\\in H$ such that\n$$\nb\\notin U'\\cup V',\\quad \\forall u'\\in U'\\,E_H(b,u'),\\quad \\forall v'\\in V'\\,\\neg E_H(b,v').\n$$\nBecause $B=U'\\cup V'$, we have $b\\notin B$.

If $a_i\\in\\operatorname{dom}(f_n)$, set $f_{n+1}=f_n$. Otherwise, apply the Forth Lemma to $f_n$ and $a_i$ to obtain an extension $f_{n+1}$ with $a_i$ in its domain.\n  * If $n$ is odd, let $i=(n-1)/2$. If $b_i\\in\\operatorname{ran}(f_n)$, set $f_{n+1}=f_n$. Otherwise, apply the Back Lemma to $f_n$ and $b_i$ to obtain an extension $f_{n+1}$ with $b_i$ in its range.\n\nNow set $f=\\bigcup_{n\\in\\mathbb N}f_n$. Each $f_n$ is a partial isomorphism, so $f$ preserves the edge relation. By construction:\n- For every $i$, $a_i$ is added to the domain at step $2i$ (or earlier), hence $a_i\\in\\operatorname{dom}(f)$.\n- For every $i$, $b_i$ is added to the range at step $2i+1$ (or earlier), hence $b_i\\in\\operatorname{ran}(f)$.\n\nThus $f$ is a bijection from $G$ onto $H$ and respects the graph relation, i.e. $f$ is an isomorphism.\n\nTherefore any two countable models of $T$ are isomorphic; $T$ is $\\aleph_0$-categorical. \u220e",

Hence injectivity holds.\n\nNow we show that every element of \\(S\\) can be represented as \\(4\\alpha+6\\beta+9\\gamma\\) with \\(0\\le\\alpha,\\beta\\le2,\\;\\gamma\\ge0\\).  \nGiven any \\(n\\in S\\), write \\(n = 4a+6b+9c\\) with \\(a,b,c\\ge0\\).  \nApply the reduction rules to the monomial \\(x^a y^b z^c\\) to obtain its normal form \\(x^{\\alpha}y^{\\beta}z^{\\gamma}\\).  \nBecause the reduction preserves the total exponent (it only replaces equal powers of \\(t\\)), we have  \n\n\\[\nn = 4a+6b+9c = 4\\alpha+6\\beta+9\\gamma,\n\\]\n\nand the bounds on \\(\\alpha,\\beta\\) are satisfied.  \nThus the image of \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) under \\(\\psi\\) is exactly the \\(k\\)-basis \\(\\{t^n \\mid n\\in S\\}\\) of \\(A\\).  \nTherefore \\(\\psi\\) is a \\(k\\)-linear isomorphism, hence an isomorphism of rings, and  \n\n\\[\n\\ker\\varphi = J = (x^3 - y^2,\\; y^3 - z^2).\n\\]\n\nThe two generators are minimal: the ideal has height \\(2\\) (since \\(\\dim A = 1\\) and \\(k[x,y,z]\\) has dimension \\(3\\)), so at least two generators are needed. \u220e\n\n---\n\n### 2.

Normality of $A$ and description of the singular locus\n\nLet $k$ be an algebraically closed field with $\\operatorname{char}(k)\\nmid n$ and $n\\ge 2$.  \nSet $f = xy - z^n \\in k[x,y,z]$ and $A = k[x,y,z]/(f)$, $X = \\operatorname{Spec}(A)$.\n\n**$A$ is an integral domain.**  \nThe polynomial $f$ is irreducible: treat it as a polynomial in $x$,  \n$f = x\\,y - z^n$. If it factored, we would have  \n$f = (x A(y,z) + B(y,z))\\,C(y,z)$ with $A,C,B\\in k[y,z]$.  \nThen $A C = y$ and $B C = -z^n$. Since $y$ and $z^n$ are coprime in the UFD $k[y,z]$, $C$ must be a unit, hence the factorisation is trivial.  \nThus $(f)$ is prime and $A$ is a domain.\n\n**Singular locus.**  \nThe Jacobian matrix of $f$ is $(\\partial f/\\partial x,\\partial f/\\partial y,\\partial f/\\partial z) = (y,\\,x,\\,-n z^{n-1})$.  \nOver the algebraically closed field $k$, a point of $X$ is singular iff it lies on $V(f)$ and all partial derivatives vanish.  \nHence we need  \n$$\ny = 0,\\quad x = 0,\\quad n z^{n-1}=0.\n$$  \nBecause $\\operatorname{char}(k)\\nmid n$, $n\\neq 0$ in $k$, so $z^{n-1}=0$ forces $z=0$.  \nThus the only singular point is the origin, corresponding to the maximal ideal $(x,y,z)$ of $A$.\n\n**Normality.**  \nThe ring $k[x,y,z]$ is regular, and $A$ is a hypersurface, hence a complete intersection.  \nTherefore $A$ is Cohen\u2013Macaulay; in particular it satisfies Serre\u2019s condition $(S_2)$.  \nThe singular locus consists of a single closed point; since $\\dim X = 2$, this point has codimension $2$, so $A$ is regular in codimension $1$, i.e. condition $(R_1)$ holds.  \nBy Serre\u2019s criterion $(R_1)+(S_2)$, $A$ is a normal domain.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Computation of $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$\n\nWe realise $A$ as the invariant ring of a finite group action.\n\nLet $\\zeta\\in k$ be a primitive $n$-th root of unity (exists because $k$ is algebraically closed and $\\operatorname{char}(k)\\nmid n$).  \nDefine an action of the cyclic group $G = \\mu_n = \\langle \\zeta \\rangle$ on the polynomial ring $B = k[u,v]$ by  \n$$\n\\zeta\\cdot (u,v) = (\\zeta u,\\, \\zeta^{-1} v).\n$$  \nThis extends to a $k$-algebra action.\n\nThe invariant ring $B^G$ is generated by $u^n, v^n, uv$.  \nIndeed, a monomial $u^a v^b$ is invariant iff $\\zeta^{a-b}=1$, i.e. $a\\equiv b\\pmod{n}$; such monomials are products of $u^n, v^n$ and $uv$.\n\nDefine a $k$-algebra homomorphism  \n$$\n\\varphi\\colon k[x,y,z] \\longrightarrow B^G,\\qquad x\\mapsto u^n,\\; y\\mapsto v^n,\\; z\\mapsto uv.\n$$  \nSince $u^n v^n = (uv)^n$, we have $\\varphi(xy-z^n)=0$, so $\\varphi$ factors through $A$, yielding  \n$$\n\\psi\\colon A \\longrightarrow B^G.\n$$\n\nWe claim $\\psi$ is an isomorphism.\n\n*Proof of the claim.*  \nThe element $u$ satisfies the monic polynomial $T^n - x \\in A[T]$, hence $u$ is integral over $A$; similarly $v$ is integral. Thus $B$ is integral over $A$.  \nThe induced morphism $\\pi\\colon Y=\\operatorname{Spec} B \\to X=\\operatorname{Spec} A$ is finite and dominant.  \nThe field of fractions of $A$ is $K = \\operatorname{Frac}(A)$.  \nThe extension $K(u,v)/K$ is Galois with group $G$ (because $u^n = x$ and $v^n = y$ with the relation $uv = z$).  \nHence $K = (K(u,v))^G$.  \nNow $B^G$ is contained in $K$ (since it lies in $\\operatorname{Frac}(A)$) and is integral over $A$.  \nBecause $A$ is normal, any element of $K$ integral over $A$ belongs to $A$.  \nTherefore $B^G \\subseteq A$. The inclusion $A \\subseteq B^G$ is obvious from the definition of $\\psi$ (the images of $x,y,z$ generate $B^G$), so $A = B^G$.  \nThus $\\psi$ is an isomorphism. $\\square$\n\nConsequently, we may identify $A = B^G$ and $X = Y/G$ with $\\pi\\colon Y\\to X$ the quotient map.\n\n**Properties of $\\pi$.**  \n- $Y = \\mathbb{A}^2_k$ is smooth, hence factorial: $\\mathrm{Cl}(Y)=0$.  \n- $A$ is Cohen\u2013Macaulay (as shown) and $B$ is regular; a finite morphism from a regular scheme to a Cohen\u2013Macaulay scheme is flat (by the \u201cmiracle flatness\u201d theorem). Hence $\\pi$ is flat.  \n- The $G$-action is free on $Y\\setminus\\{0\\}$ (the only fixed point is the origin). Therefore $\\pi$ is \u00e9tale in codimension $1$.\n\n**Construction of an isomorphism $\\Psi\\colon \\mathrm{Cl}(X) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}(G,k^\\times)$.**  \n\nFor a Weil divisor $D$ on $X$, consider its flat pullback $\\pi^* D$ (as a cycle).  \nSince $\\mathrm{Cl}(Y)=0$, $\\pi^* D$ is principal: there exists $f_D \\in K(Y)^\\times$ such that  \n$$\n\\operatorname{div}_Y(f_D) = \\pi^* D.\n$$  \nFor any $g\\in G$, we have $g\\cdot \\pi^* D = \\pi^* D$ because $\\pi$ is $G$-invariant. Hence  \n$$\n\\operatorname{div}_Y(g\\cdot f_D) = \\operatorname{div}_Y(f_D),\n$$  \nso $g\\cdot f_D / f_D$ is a unit in $B$. As $B$ is a UFD, its only units are nonzero constants, i.e. elements of $k^\\times$. Thus we obtain a character  \n$$\n\\chi_D\\colon G \\longrightarrow k^\\times,\\qquad \\chi_D(g) = \\frac{g\\cdot f_D}{f_D}.\n$$  \nIf we replace $f_D$ by $c f_D$ ($c\\in k^\\times$), the ratio is unchanged.  \nIf $D' = D + \\operatorname{div}_X(h)$ is linearly equivalent to $D$, we may take $f_{D'} = f_D \\cdot \\pi^* h$; then  \n$$\n\\frac{g\\cdot f_{D'}}{f_{D'}} = \\frac{g\\cdot f_D}{f_D} \\cdot \\frac{g\\cdot \\pi^* h}{\\pi^* h} = \\frac{g\\cdot f_D}{f_D},\n$$  \nbecause $\\pi^* h$ is $G$-invariant (it comes from $A$). Hence $\\chi_D$ depends only on the class $[D]$.  \nDefine $\\Psi([D]) = \\chi_D$. This is a group homomorphism.\n\n**Injectivity of $\\Psi$.**  \nSuppose $\\Psi([D]) = 1$. Then we can choose $f_D$ such that $g\\cdot f_D = f_D$ for all $g$, i.e. $f_D \\in K(Y)^G = K(X)$.  \nThus $\\pi^* D = \\operatorname{div}_Y(f_D)$.  \nBecause $\\pi$ is flat, we have $\\pi^* \\operatorname{div}_X(f_D) = \\operatorname{div}_Y(f_D)$ (the pullback of a principal divisor is the divisor of the pullback of the function).  \nHence $\\pi^*(D - \\operatorname{div}_X(f_D)) = 0$.  \nThe map $\\pi^*$ on Weil divisor groups is injective: if $\\pi^* E = 0$ then applying the pushforward $\\pi_*$ gives $\\deg(\\pi)\\, E = 0$, so $E=0$.  \nTherefore $D = \\operatorname{div}_X(f_D)$, i.e. $D$ is principal. Hence $[D]=0$, proving injectivity.\n\n**Surjectivity of $\\Psi$.**  \nLet $\\chi\\in \\operatorname{Hom}(G,k^\\times)$. Since $G$ is cyclic of order $n$, there exists an integer $m$ (mod $n$) such that $\\chi(\\zeta) = \\zeta^m$.  \nChoose $f = u^m \\in K(Y)$. For $g=\\zeta$ we have  \n$$\ng\\cdot u = \\zeta u \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad g\\cdot f = \\zeta^m u^m = \\chi(g)\\, f.\n$$  \nThe divisor $\\operatorname{div}_Y(f) = m\\cdot \\operatorname{div}_Y(u)$ is $G$-invariant (multiplication by a constant does not change the divisor).  \nBecause $\\pi$ is a quotient map that is \u00e9tale in codimension $1$, there exists a unique Weil divisor $D_\\chi$ on $X$ with $\\pi^* D_\\chi = \\operatorname{div}_Y(f)$.  \n(Explicitly, $\\operatorname{div}_Y(u)$ is prime and $G$-invariant; its image under $\\pi$ is the prime divisor $D$ defined by $(x,z)$ in $A$ \u2013 see part\u202f3. Then we can take $D_\\chi = m D$.)  \nFor this divisor we have $\\Psi([D_\\chi]) = \\chi$. Hence $\\Psi$ is surjective.\n\nThus $\\Psi$ is an isomorphism, and  \n$$\n\\mathrm{Cl}(A) \\cong \\operatorname{Hom}(G,k^\\times) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}.\n$$\n\n---\n\n### 3.

Computation of \\(\\mathrm{Cl}(A)\\)\n\nWe realise \\(A\\) as the invariant ring of a finite group action.\n\nLet \\(\\zeta\\in k\\) be a primitive \\(n\\)-th root of unity (exists because \\(k\\) is algebraically closed and \\(\\operatorname{char}(k)\\nmid n\\)).  \nDefine an action of the cyclic group \\(G = \\mu_n = \\langle \\zeta \\rangle\\) on the polynomial ring \\(B = k[u,v]\\) by  \n\\[\n\\zeta\\cdot (u,v) = (\\zeta u,\\, \\zeta^{-1} v).\n\\]  \nThis extends to a \\(k\\)-algebra action.\n\nThe invariant ring \\(B^G\\) is generated by \\(u^n, v^n, uv\\).  \nIndeed, a monomial \\(u^a v^b\\) is invariant iff \\(\\zeta^{a-b}=1\\), i.e. \\(a\\equiv b\\pmod{n}\\); such monomials are products of \\(u^n, v^n\\) and \\(uv\\).\n\nDefine a \\(k\\)-algebra homomorphism  \n\\[\n\\varphi\\colon k[x,y,z] \\longrightarrow B^G,\\qquad x\\mapsto u^n,\\; y\\mapsto v^n,\\; z\\mapsto uv.\n\\]  \nSince \\(u^n v^n = (uv)^n\\), we have \\(\\varphi(xy-z^n)=0\\), so \\(\\varphi\\) factors through \\(A\\), yielding  \n\\[\n\\psi\\colon A \\longrightarrow B^G.\n\\]\n\nWe claim \\(\\psi\\) is an isomorphism.\n\n*Proof of the claim.*  \nThe element \\(u\\) satisfies the monic polynomial \\(T^n - x \\in A[T]\\), hence \\(u\\) is integral over \\(A\\); similarly \\(v\\) is integral. Thus \\(B\\) is integral over \\(A\\).  \nThe induced morphism \\(\\pi\\colon Y=\\operatorname{Spec} B \\to X=\\operatorname{Spec} A\\) is finite and dominant.  \nThe field of fractions of \\(A\\) is \\(K = \\operatorname{Frac}(A)\\).  \nThe extension \\(K(u,v)/K\\) is Galois with group \\(G\\) (because \\(u^n = x\\) and \\(v^n = y\\) with the relation \\(uv = z\\)).  \nHence \\(K = (K(u,v))^G\\).  \nNow \\(B^G\\) is contained in \\(K\\) (since it lies in \\(\\operatorname{Frac}(A)\\)) and is integral over \\(A\\).  \nBecause \\(A\\) is normal, any element of \\(K\\) integral over \\(A\\) belongs to \\(A\\).  \nTherefore \\(B^G \\subseteq A\\). The inclusion \\(A \\subseteq B^G\\) is obvious from the definition of \\(\\psi\\) (the images of \\(x,y,z\\) generate \\(B^G\\)), so \\(A = B^G\\).  \nThus \\(\\psi\\) is an isomorphism. \\(\\square\\)\n\nConsequently, we may identify \\(A = B^G\\) and \\(X = Y/G\\) with \\(\\pi\\colon Y\\to X\\) the quotient map.\n\n**Properties of \\(\\pi\\).**  \n- \\(Y = \\mathbb{A}^2_k\\) is smooth, hence factorial: \\(\\mathrm{Cl}(Y)=0\\).  \n- \\(A\\) is Cohen\u2013Macaulay (as shown) and \\(B\\) is regular; a finite morphism from a regular scheme to a Cohen\u2013Macaulay scheme is flat (by the \u201cmiracle flatness\u201d theorem). Hence \\(\\pi\\) is flat.  \n- The \\(G\\)-action is free on \\(Y\\setminus\\{0\\}\\) (the only fixed point is the origin). Therefore \\(\\pi\\) is \u00e9tale in codimension \\(1\\).\n\n**Construction of an isomorphism \\(\\Psi\\colon \\mathrm{Cl}(X) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}(G,k^\\times)\\).**  \n\nFor a Weil divisor \\(D\\) on \\(X\\), consider its flat pullback \\(\\pi^* D\\) (as a cycle).  \nSince \\(\\mathrm{Cl}(Y)=0\\), \\(\\pi^* D\\) is principal: there exists \\(f_D \\in K(Y)^\\times\\) such that  \n\\[\n\\operatorname{div}_Y(f_D) = \\pi^* D.\n\\]  \nFor any \\(g\\in G\\), we have \\(g\\cdot \\pi^* D = \\pi^* D\\) because \\(\\pi\\) is \\(G\\)-invariant. Hence  \n\\[\n\\operatorname{div}_Y(g\\cdot f_D) = \\operatorname{div}_Y(f_D),\n\\]  \nso \\(g\\cdot f_D / f_D\\) is a unit in \\(B\\). As \\(B\\) is a UFD, its only units are nonzero constants, i.e. elements of \\(k^\\times\\). Thus we obtain a character  \n\\[\n\\chi_D\\colon G \\longrightarrow k^\\times,\\qquad \\chi_D(g) = \\frac{g\\cdot f_D}{f_D}.\n\\]  \nIf we replace \\(f_D\\) by \\(c f_D\\) (\\(c\\in k^\\times\\)), the ratio is unchanged.  \nIf \\(D' = D + \\operatorname{div}_X(h)\\) is linearly equivalent to \\(D\\), we may take \\(f_{D'} = f_D \\cdot \\pi^* h\\); then  \n\\[\n\\frac{g\\cdot f_{D'}}{f_{D'}} = \\frac{g\\cdot f_D}{f_D} \\cdot \\frac{g\\cdot \\pi^* h}{\\pi^* h} = \\frac{g\\cdot f_D}{f_D},\n\\]  \nbecause \\(\\pi^* h\\) is \\(G\\)-invariant (it comes from \\(A\\)). Hence \\(\\chi_D\\) depends only on the class \\([D]\\).  \nDefine \\(\\Psi([D]) = \\chi_D\\). This is a group homomorphism.\n\n**Injectivity of \\(\\Psi\\).**  \nSuppose \\(\\Psi([D]) = 1\\). Then we can choose \\(f_D\\) such that \\(g\\cdot f_D = f_D\\) for all \\(g\\), i.e. \\(f_D \\in K(Y)^G = K(X)\\).  \nThus \\(\\pi^* D = \\operatorname{div}_Y(f_D)\\).  \nBecause \\(\\pi\\) is flat, we have \\(\\pi^* \\operatorname{div}_X(f_D) = \\operatorname{div}_Y(f_D)\\) (the pullback of a principal divisor is the divisor of the pullback of the function).  \nHence \\(\\pi^*(D - \\operatorname{div}_X(f_D)) = 0\\).  \nThe map \\(\\pi^*\\) on Weil divisor groups is injective: if \\(\\pi^* E = 0\\) then applying the pushforward \\(\\pi_*\\) gives \\(\\deg(\\pi)\\, E = 0\\), so \\(E=0\\).  \nTherefore \\(D = \\operatorname{div}_X(f_D)\\), i.e. \\(D\\) is principal. Hence \\([D]=0\\), proving injectivity.\n\n**Surjectivity of \\(\\Psi\\).**  \nLet \\(\\chi\\in \\operatorname{Hom}(G,k^\\times)\\). Since \\(G\\) is cyclic of order \\(n\\), there exists an integer \\(m\\) (mod \\(n\\)) such that \\(\\chi(\\zeta) = \\zeta^m\\).  \nChoose \\(f = u^m \\in K(Y)\\). For \\(g=\\zeta\\) we have  \n\\[\ng\\cdot u = \\zeta u \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad g\\cdot f = \\zeta^m u^m = \\chi(g)\\, f.\n\\]  \nThe divisor \\(\\operatorname{div}_Y(f) = m\\cdot \\operatorname{div}_Y(u)\\) is \\(G\\)-invariant (multiplication by a constant does not change the divisor).  \nBecause \\(\\pi\\) is a quotient map that is \u00e9tale in codimension \\(1\\), there exists a unique Weil divisor \\(D_\\chi\\) on \\(X\\) with \\(\\pi^* D_\\chi = \\operatorname{div}_Y(f)\\).  \n(Explicitly, \\(\\operatorname{div}_Y(u)\\) is prime and \\(G\\)-invariant; its image under \\(\\pi\\) is the prime divisor \\(D\\) defined by \\((x,z)\\) in \\(A\\) \u2013 see part\u202f3. Then we can take \\(D_\\chi = m D\\).)  \nFor this divisor we have \\(\\Psi([D_\\chi]) = \\chi\\). Hence \\(\\Psi\\) is surjective.\n\nThus \\(\\Psi\\) is an isomorphism, and  \n\\[\n\\mathrm{Cl}(A) \\cong \\operatorname{Hom}(G,k^\\times) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### 3. The divisor \\(D = V(\\mathfrak p)\\) with \\(\\mathfrak p = (x,z)\\)\n\nThe ideal \\(\\mathfrak p = (x,z)\\) is prime in \\(A\\) because \\(A/\\mathfrak p \\cong k[y]\\) is a domain.  \nHence it defines an irreducible Weil divisor \\(D\\) on \\(X\\).\n\nWe determine its class via the isomorphism \\(\\Psi\\).\n\nUnder the identification \\(A = B^G\\), we have \\(x = u^n\\), \\(z = uv\\).  \nThe flat pullback of \\(D\\) is the cycle associated to the subscheme defined by the ideal \\((u^n, uv) \\subset B\\).  \nIn the localisation at the generic point of the prime divisor \\(E = V(u)\\) (i.e. at the DVR \\(B_{(u)}\\)), the ideal \\((u^n, uv)\\) generates \\((u)\\) because \\(v\\) becomes a unit. Hence the associated cycle is exactly \\(\\operatorname{div}_Y(u)\\).  \nThus  \n\\[\n\\pi^* D = \\operatorname{div}_Y(u).\n\\]  \nTake \\(f = u\\) in the construction of \\(\\Psi\\).

The algebra is\n$$\nA = k\\langle x,y\\rangle/(x^2,\\;y^2,\\;xy+yx).\n$$\nWe denote the residue classes of the free generators again by $x,y$ and set $w=xy$.\n\n## 1. Basis and multiplication\n\n**Claim.** $A$ is 4\u2011dimensional with basis $\\{1,x,y,w\\}$. The products among these basis elements are:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cccc}\n& 1 & x & y & w \\\\ \\hline\n1 & 1 & x & y & w \\\\\nx & x & 0 & w & 0 \\\\\ny & y & -w & 0 & 0 \\\\\nw & w & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{array}\n$$\n(All missing entries are zero.)\n\n*Proof.*  \nThe relations are $x^2=0$, $y^2=0$ and $xy=-yx$ (since $\\operatorname{char}(k)\\neq2$). In any monomial in $x$ and $y$ we may replace $xx$ or $yy$ by $0$ and swap an adjacent $xy$ to $-yx$. Consequently every monomial reduces either to $0$ or to $\\pm1$, $\\pm x$, $\\pm y$ or $\\pm xy$. Hence the set $\\{1,x,y,xy\\}$ spans $A$.  \n\nTo prove linear independence we use the exterior algebra $\\Lambda(V)$ of a 2\u2011dimensional vector space $V$ with basis $e_1,e_2$. Mapping $x\\mapsto e_1$, $y\\mapsto e_2$ gives a well\u2011defined algebra homomorphism $A\\to\\Lambda(V)$ because the relations hold: $e_1^2=0$, $e_2^2=0$, $e_1e_2=-e_2e_1$. In $\\Lambda(V)$ the elements $1,e_1,e_2,e_1\\wedge e_2$ are linearly independent. Their preimages are $1,x,y,xy$, so the latter are linearly independent in $A$. Thus $\\{1,x,y,w\\}$ is a basis and $\\dim_k A=4$.\n\nThe multiplication table follows directly from the relations:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx^2&=0,\\quad y^2=0,\\quad xy=w,\\quad yx=-w,\\\\\nxw &= x(xy)=0,\\quad wx = (xy)x=0,\\\\\nyw &= y(xy)=0,\\quad wy = (xy)y=0,\\quad w^2=0.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nThe remaining products with $1$ are trivial. $\\square$\n\n## 2. Jacobson radical and ideals\n\nLet $M = \\operatorname{span}\\{x,y,w\\}$. From the multiplication table we see that $M$ is a two\u2011sided ideal and $A/M\\cong k$, so $M$ is maximal. Moreover\n$$\nM^2 = k\\,w,\\qquad M^3 = 0,\n$$\nhence $M$ is nilpotent. In any finite\u2011dimensional $k$-algebra the Jacobson radical $J(A)$ is the largest nilpotent ideal and equals the intersection of all maximal left ideals. Because $M$ is a nilpotent maximal ideal we have $J(A)=M$. Consequently\n$$\nJ(A)^2 = k\\,w,\\qquad J(A)^3 = 0.\n$$\n\nAn element $\\lambda\\cdot1 + m$ with $\\lambda\\in k^\\times$ and $m\\in M$ is invertible (its inverse is $\\lambda^{-1}(1-\\lambda^{-1}m+\\lambda^{-2}m^2)$ because $m^3=0$). Thus the set of non\u2011units is exactly $M$, so $A$ is a local algebra.\n\n**Classification of two\u2011sided ideals.**  \nIf an ideal $I$ contains a unit then $I=A$. Hence every proper ideal is contained in $M$. Let $I\\subseteq M$ be a nonzero ideal. Write any $0\\neq u\\in I$ as $u = v + \\gamma w$ with $v\\in V:=\\operatorname{span}\\{x,y\\}$ and $\\gamma\\in k$.  \nIf $v\\neq0$, say $v=\\alpha x+\\beta y$. Then\n$$\nL_x(u)=L_x(v)=\\beta w,\\qquad L_y(u)=L_y(v)=-\\alpha w.\n$$\nSince at least one of $\\alpha,\\beta$ is nonzero, applying the appropriate left multiplication gives a nonzero multiple of $w$ inside $I$; thus $w\\in I$.  \nIf $v=0$ then $u=\\gamma w$ and $\\gamma\\neq0$, so again $w\\in I$. Therefore every nonzero ideal $I\\subseteq M$ must contain $w$.\n\nConversely, any subspace $I\\subseteq M$ that contains $w$ is an ideal: for $a\\in A$ write $a=\\lambda + m$ ($\\lambda\\in k,\\;m\\in M$). Then\n$$\na I = \\lambda I + m I \\subseteq I + M I \\subseteq I + M^2 = I + k w \\subseteq I,\n$$\nand similarly $I a \\subseteq I$. (Here we used $M I\\subseteq M^2 = k w\\subseteq I$.)\n\nThus the proper nonzero ideals are exactly the subspaces of $M$ that contain $w$. In terms of dimensions:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\dim 1: \\quad I_1 = k\\,w,\\\\\n&\\dim 2: \\quad I_{2,v} = k\\,w \\oplus k\\,v \\quad\\text{for any } v\\in V\\setminus\\{0\\},\\\\\n&\\dim 3: \\quad I_3 = M.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nTogether with $\\{0\\}$ and $A$ this gives all two\u2011sided ideals of $A$.\n\n## 3. Center\n\nLet $z = \\alpha + \\beta x + \\gamma y + \\delta w$ with $\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma,\\delta\\in k$. Commuting with $x$:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nxz &= \\alpha x + \\gamma w,\\\\\nzx &= \\alpha x - \\gamma w,\n\\end{aligned}\n\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad [z,x] = -2\\gamma w.\n$$\nSince $\\operatorname{char}(k)\\neq2$, $[z,x]=0$ forces $\\gamma=0$. Commuting with $y$:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nyz &= \\alpha y - \\beta w,\\\\\nzy &= \\alpha y + \\beta w,\n\\end{aligned}\n\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad [z,y] = 2\\beta w,\n$$\nso $\\beta=0$. Hence $z = \\alpha + \\delta w$. Such an element clearly commutes with $x$ and $y$ (the computations give zero), and therefore with every element of $A$. Thus\n$$\nZ(A) = k\\cdot1 \\oplus k\\cdot w,\n$$\na 2\u2011dimensional commutative algebra with $w^2=0$.\n\n## 4. Automorphism group\n\nLet $\\varphi\\in\\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A)$. Because automorphisms preserve the Jacobson radical, $\\varphi(M)=M$ and $\\varphi$ induces an automorphism of $M/M^2$ and of $M^2=k w$. In particular $\\varphi(w)=\\lambda w$ for some $\\lambda\\in k^\\times$.\n\nWrite the images of the generators as\n$$\n\\varphi(x)= a x + b y + \\alpha w,\\qquad \\varphi(y)= c x + d y + \\beta w,\n$$\nwith $a,b,c,d,\\alpha,\\beta\\in k$ (no constant terms because $\\varphi(x),\\varphi(y)\\in M$). Modulo $M^2$ we have\n$$\n\\overline{\\varphi(x)} = a\\bar x + b\\bar y,\\qquad \\overline{\\varphi(y)} = c\\bar x + d\\bar y,\n$$\nso the induced map on the 2\u2011dimensional space $M/M^2$ is represented by the matrix $\\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\\\ c&d\\end{pmatrix}$ with respect to the basis $\\{\\bar x,\\bar y\\}$. Since $\\varphi$ is an automorphism, this matrix must be invertible, i.e. $\\det = ad-bc \\neq 0$.\n\nConversely, given any scalars $a,b,c,d,\\alpha,\\beta$ with $ad-bc\\neq0$, define a $k$-linear map $\\varphi$ on the generators by the above formulas. We check that the defining relations are preserved:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\varphi(x)^2 &= (a x+b y+\\alpha w)^2 = ab\\,xy + ba\\,yx = ab\\,w - ab\\,w =0,\\\\\n\\varphi(y)^2 &= (c x+d y+\\beta w)^2 = cd\\,xy + dc\\,yx = cd\\,w - cd\\,w =0,\\\\\n\\varphi(x)\\varphi(y)+\\varphi(y)\\varphi(x) &= (ad-bc)w + (cb-da)w =0.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nThus $\\varphi$ extends to a homomorphism $A\\to A$. To see that $\\varphi$ is an automorphism we argue via the radical filtration. Because the matrix on $M/M^2$ is invertible and $\\varphi(w)=(ad-bc)w$ is a nonzero multiple of $w$, $\\varphi$ induces an isomorphism on each graded piece $\\operatorname{gr}^i(A)=J(A)^i/J(A)^{i+1}$. A standard filtration argument (or a direct dimension count) shows that $\\varphi$ is then bijective. More concretely:\n- **Injectivity:** If $\\varphi(u)=0$ write $u=\\lambda+m$ with $m\\in M$. Then $0=\\lambda+\\varphi(m)$ forces $\\lambda=0$ (since $\\varphi(m)\\in M$) and $\\varphi(m)=0$. If $m\\neq0$ let $r$ be maximal with $m\\in J(A)^r$ ($r=1$ or $2$). If $r=2$ then $m=\\mu w$ and $0=\\varphi(m)=\\mu(ad-bc)w$ implies $\\mu=0$. If $r=1$ then $\\overline{m}\\neq0$ in $M/M^2$, but $\\varphi(\\overline{m})=\\overline{\\varphi(m)}=0$ contradicts the invertibility of $\\varphi$ on $M/M^2$. Hence $m=0$.\n- **Surjectivity:** Since $\\varphi$ is injective and $A$ is finite\u2011dimensional, it is also surjective. Alternatively, because $\\varphi|_M:M\\to M$ is injective and $\\dim M<\\infty$, it is bijective; then for any $\\lambda+m\\in A$ choose $m'\\in M$ with $\\varphi(m')=m$ and note $\\varphi(\\lambda+m')=\\lambda+m$.\n\nTherefore every such choice gives an automorphism, and the parameters are uniquely determined by $\\varphi$.\n\nNow define a map\n$$\n\\Phi:\\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A)\\longrightarrow \\mathrm{GL}_2(k),\\qquad \\Phi(\\varphi)=\\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\\\ c&d\\end{pmatrix},\n$$\nwhere $\\varphi(x)=a x+b y+\\alpha w,\\;\\varphi(y)=c x+d y+\\beta w$. This is a group homomorphism because the composition of automorphisms corresponds to multiplication of the matrices representing their action on $M/M^2$. Indeed, if $\\psi$ has matrix $\\begin{pmatrix}a'&b'\\\\ c'&d'\\end{pmatrix}$ then\n$$\n(\\varphi\\circ\\psi)(x) \\equiv (a a'+b c')\\,\\bar x + (a b'+b d')\\,\\bar y \\pmod{M^2},\n$$\nand similarly for $y$, which is exactly the product matrix $\\Phi(\\varphi)\\Phi(\\psi)$.\n\nThe kernel of $\\Phi$ consists of automorphisms with $a=d=1$, $b=c=0$, i.e.\n$$\n\\varphi(x)=x+\\alpha w,\\quad \\varphi(y)=y+\\beta w,\\qquad \\alpha,\\beta\\in k.\n$$\nComposition of two such automorphisms adds the parameters, so $\\ker\\Phi \\cong (k,+)\\times(k,+) \\cong k^2$.\n\nThe map\n$$\n\\Psi:\\mathrm{GL}_2(k)\\to\\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A),\\qquad \\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\\\ c&d\\end{pmatrix} \\longmapsto \\bigl(x\\mapsto a x+b y,\\; y\\mapsto c x+d y\\bigr)\n$$\nis a group homomorphism (it respects matrix multiplication) and satisfies $\\Phi\\circ\\Psi=\\operatorname{id}_{\\mathrm{GL}_2(k)}$. Hence $\\Psi$ splits the surjection $\\Phi$.\n\nWe thus obtain a split short exact sequence\n$$\n1 \\longrightarrow k^2 \\longrightarrow \\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A) \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{GL}_2(k) \\longrightarrow 1.\n$$\n\nThis completes the solution.",

A convenient basis\n\nChoose the basis of $J$:\n$$\nI = \\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\\\0&1\\end{pmatrix},\\quad \nh = \\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\\\0&-1\\end{pmatrix},\\quad \ne = \\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\\\0&0\\end{pmatrix},\\quad \nf = \\begin{pmatrix}0&0\\\\1&0\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$  \nTheir Jordan products are easily computed:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cccc}\n\\circ & I & h & e & f \\\\ \\hline\nI   & I & h & e & f \\\\\nh   & h & I & 0 & 0 \\\\\ne   & e & 0 & 0 & \\frac12 I \\\\\nf   & f & 0 & \\frac12 I & 0\n\\end{array}\n$$  \n(All missing entries follow from commutativity.)\n\n#### 3.3. Constraints from the derivation property\n\nWrite $D$ on the basis. Because $D(I)=0$, we only need\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nD(h) &= \\alpha I + a h + b e + c f,\\\\\nD(e) &= \\beta I + d h + p e + q f,\\\\\nD(f) &= \\gamma I + u h + v e + w f.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$  \nWe apply the derivation identity to the products of basis elements.\n\n* **From $h\\circ h = I$:**  \n$0 = D(I) = D(h\\circ h) = 2\\,D(h)\\circ h$ \u21d2 $D(h)\\circ h = 0$.  \nCompute $D(h)\\circ h = \\alpha h + a I$. Hence $\\alpha = 0,\\ a = 0$. So  \n$$\nD(h) = b e + c f. \\tag{1}\n$$\n\n* **From $e\\circ e = 0$:**  \n$0 = D(e\\circ e) = 2\\,D(e)\\circ e$ \u21d2 $D(e)\\circ e = 0$.  \n$D(e)\\circ e = \\beta e + \\frac{q}{2} I$. Thus $\\beta = 0,\\ q = 0$. So  \n$$\nD(e) = d h + p e. \\tag{2}\n$$\n\n* **From $f\\circ f = 0$:**  \n$0 = D(f\\circ f) = 2\\,D(f)\\circ f$ \u21d2 $D(f)\\circ f = 0$.  \n$D(f)\\circ f = \\gamma f + \\frac{v}{2} I$. Thus $\\gamma = 0,\\ v = 0$. So  \n$$\nD(f) = u h + w f. \\tag{3}\n$$\n\n* **From $h\\circ e = 0$:**  \n$0 = D(h)\\circ e + h\\circ D(e)$.  \nUsing (1) and (2):  \n$D(h)\\circ e = \\frac{c}{2} I$,\u2003$h\\circ D(e) = d I$.  \nHence $\\frac{c}{2} + d = 0$ \u21d2 $d = -\\frac{c}{2}$. \\tag{4}\n\n* **From $h\\circ f = 0$:**  \n$0 = D(h)\\circ f + h\\circ D(f)$.  \n$D(h)\\circ f = \\frac{b}{2} I$,\u2003$h\\circ D(f) = u I$.  \nThus $\\frac{b}{2} + u = 0$ \u21d2 $u = -\\frac{b}{2}$. \\tag{5}\n\n* **From $e\\circ f = \\frac12 I$:**  \n$0 = D(\\frac12 I) = D(e)\\circ f + e\\circ D(f)$.  \n$D(e)\\circ f = \\frac{p}{2} I$,\u2003$e\\circ D(f) = \\frac{w}{2} I$.  \nTherefore $\\frac{p}{2} + \\frac{w}{2} = 0$ \u21d2 $p + w = 0$ \u21d2 $w = -p$. \\tag{6}\n\nSummarising, the derivation is completely determined by three free scalars $b,c,p\\in F$:\n$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\nD(h) &= b e + c f,\\\\\nD(e) &= -\\frac{c}{2}\\, h + p\\, e,\\\\\nD(f) &= -\\frac{b}{2}\\, h - p\\, f.\n\\end{aligned}}\n\\tag{7}\n$$\n\n#### 3.4. Relation with commutators\n\nFor any traceless matrix $C\\in \\mathfrak{sl}_2(F)$ define  \n$$\nD_C(X) = [C,X] = CX - XC.\n$$  \nOne checks directly (or notes that $D_C$ is an associative derivation and hence a Jordan derivation) that $D_C$ satisfies the derivation identity.\n\nWrite $C$ in the basis: $C = \\alpha h + \\beta e + \\gamma f$. Compute its action:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nD_C(h) &= -2\\beta\\, e + 2\\gamma\\, f,\\\\\nD_C(e) &= -\\gamma\\, h + 2\\alpha\\, e,\\\\\nD_C(f) &= \\beta\\, h - 2\\alpha\\, f.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$  \nComparing with (7) we set\n$$\nb = -2\\beta,\\quad c = 2\\gamma,\\quad p = 2\\alpha.\n$$  \nThen (7) becomes exactly the formulas above. Conversely, given any triple $(b,c,p)$, define\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{p}{2},\\quad \\beta = -\\frac{b}{2},\\quad \\gamma = \\frac{c}{2}\n$$  \n(division by $2$ is allowed because $\\operatorname{char}(F)\\neq2$). Then $C = \\alpha h + \\beta e + \\gamma f$ is traceless and $D = D_C$.\n\nIf two traceless matrices $C, C'$ give the same derivation, then $D_{C-C'}=0$, so $[C-C',X]=0$ for all $X$. Hence $C-C'$ is central, i.e., a scalar matrix $\\lambda I$. Its trace is $2\\lambda$; but $C-C'$ is traceless, so $\\lambda=0$ and $C=C'$. Thus the representation by a traceless matrix is unique.\n\n#### 3.5. Lie algebra isomorphism\n\nThe map $\\varphi: \\mathfrak{sl}_2(F) \\to \\operatorname{Der}(J)$ defined by $\\varphi(C)=D_C$ is linear, bijective (by the above), and satisfies\n$$\n[\\varphi(C_1),\\varphi(C_2)] = \\varphi([C_1,C_2]),\n$$  \nbecause the commutator of two derivations is again a derivation and the identity follows from the properties of the ordinary matrix commutator. Hence $\\varphi$ is a Lie algebra isomorphism, and we conclude\n$$\n\\operatorname{Der}(J) \\cong \\mathfrak{sl}_2(F).\n$$\n\n---\n\nAll steps are valid under the hypothesis $\\operatorname{char}(F)\\neq 2$.",

For the hyperplane bundle, $\\operatorname{ch}([H]) = e^x$, hence  \n$$\n\\operatorname{ch}(\\eta) = e^x - 1.\n$$  \nBecause $x^{n+1}=0$ in $H^*(\\mathbb{C}P^n;\\mathbb{Z})$, we compute  \n$$\n\\operatorname{ch}(\\eta^n) = (e^x-1)^n = x^n + \\text{terms of degree }>2n\\ (\\text{which vanish}).\n$$  \nThus $\\operatorname{ch}(\\eta^n) = x^n$, a generator of $H^{2n}(\\mathbb{C}P^n;\\mathbb{Q})$.\n\nOn the other hand, choose a generator $\\beta\\in\\widetilde K^0(S^{2n})$ with $\\operatorname{ch}(\\beta)=u$, a generator of $H^{2n}(S^{2n};\\mathbb{Q})$.

Hence the short exact sequence splits, yielding  \n$$\n\\widetilde K^0(\\mathbb{C}P^n) \\cong \\widetilde K^0(\\mathbb{C}P^{n-1}) \\oplus \\langle \\eta^n\\rangle.\n$$  \nThus $\\widetilde K^0(\\mathbb{C}P^n)$ is free with basis $\\{\\eta,\\eta^2,\\dots,\\eta^n\\}$. Adding the identity element $1$ (which gives the rank summand from the augmentation), we obtain that $K^0(\\mathbb{C}P^n)$ is free with basis $\\{1,\\eta,\\eta^2,\\dots,\\eta^n\\}$.\n\nIt remains to prove $\\eta^{n+1}=0$. Since $\\eta^n$ generates the kernel of $i^*$, we have $\\eta^{n+1} = \\eta\\cdot\\eta^n \\in \\ker i^*$, so $\\eta^{n+1} = c\\,\\eta^n$ for some integer $c$. Apply the Chern character:  \n$$\n\\operatorname{ch}(\\eta^{n+1}) = (e^x-1)^{n+1}.\n$$  \nBecause $x^{n+1}=0$, every term in the expansion contains at least $x^{n+1}$ and therefore vanishes; thus $\\operatorname{ch}(\\eta^{n+1})=0$. On the other hand, $\\operatorname{ch}(c\\,\\eta^n)=c\\,x^n$. Since $x^n\\neq 0$ in $H^{2n}(\\mathbb{C}P^n;\\mathbb{Q})$, we must have $c=0$. Hence $\\eta^{n+1}=0$.\n\nBecause $\\{1,\\eta,\\dots,\\eta^n\\}$ is a basis, the map $\\varphi_n$ is surjective and its kernel is exactly the ideal $(\\eta^{n+1})$.

Since $\\varphi$ is bijective and preserves order, it maps $X$ onto itself, i.e. $\\varphi$ permutes $X$.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Structure of $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)$ and its order\n\nThe group $Q_8$ is generated by $i$ and $j$ (with $k=ij$). Therefore any automorphism $\\varphi$ is uniquely determined by the images $\\varphi(i)$ and $\\varphi(j)$.\n\nBecause $\\varphi$ is an automorphism, $\\varphi(i)$ and $\\varphi(j)$ must have the same order as $i$ and $j$, namely $4$. Moreover, $\\varphi(j)$ cannot belong to the subgroup $\\langle\\varphi(i)\\rangle$. Indeed, if $\\varphi(j)\\in\\langle\\varphi(i)\\rangle$, then the image of $\\varphi$ would be contained in the cyclic subgroup $\\langle\\varphi(i)\\rangle$ which has at most $4$ elements, contradicting surjectivity.\n\nConversely, we show that for any choice of $a,b\\in Q_8$ with $|a|=4$, $|b|=4$ and $b\\notin\\langle a\\rangle$, there exists a (unique) automorphism $\\varphi$ with $\\varphi(i)=a$, $\\varphi(j)=b$.\n\n*Existence.* Because $a$ and $b$ are of order $4$, we have $a^2=b^2=-1$. Since $b\\notin\\langle a\\rangle$, we have $b\\neq \\pm a$. In $Q_8$, any two distinct order\u2011$4$ elements that are not inverses of each other anti\u2011commute: $ab=-ba$. (This can be verified directly from the multiplication table: for example $i j = k$, $j i = -k$, etc., and the same holds with signs.) Thus $a$ and $b$ satisfy the defining relations of $Q_8$: $a^2=b^2=-1$ and $ab=-ba$. Hence the assignment $i\\mapsto a$, $j\\mapsto b$ extends to a homomorphism $\\varphi\\colon Q_8\\to Q_8$. The subgroup generated by $a$ and $b$ is $\\{\\pm1,\\pm a,\\pm b,\\pm ab\\}$, which contains $8$ distinct elements and therefore equals $Q_8$. Thus $\\varphi$ is surjective, and because $Q_8$ is finite it is also injective, i.e. an automorphism.\n\n*Uniqueness* follows because $i,j$ generate $Q_8$.\n\nNow count the number of such ordered pairs $(a,b)$.  \n- There are $6$ elements of order $4$: $\\pm i,\\pm j,\\pm k$. Choose $a$ arbitrarily: $6$ possibilities.  \n- Once $a$ is fixed, the subgroup $\\langle a\\rangle$ contains exactly two elements of order $4$, namely $a$ and $-a$. The condition $b\\notin\\langle a\\rangle$ excludes these two, leaving $6-2=4$ choices for $b$.\n\nHence $|\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)| = 6\\cdot 4 = 24$.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Inner automorphism group and the action on the three cyclic subgroups\n\n#### Inner automorphisms\nFor $g\\in Q_8$, let $c_g(x)=gxg^{-1}$ be the inner automorphism induced by $g$. The centre of $Q_8$ is $Z(Q_8)=\\{\\pm1\\}$, so $c_g=c_h$ iff $g\\equiv h\\pmod{Z}$. Consequently\n$$\n\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8) \\cong Q_8/Z(Q_8),\n$$\na group of order $4$. In $Q_8/Z$, every non\u2011trivial element has order $2$ because $(gZ)^2 = g^2Z = (-1)Z = Z$. Thus $\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8)$ is isomorphic to the Klein four group $V_4$. Explicitly, the three non\u2011trivial inner automorphisms are $c_i$, $c_j$, $c_k$ (with $c_i^2=c_j^2=c_k^2=\\operatorname{id}$ and $c_i c_j = c_{ij}=c_k$, etc.).\n\n#### Action on the cyclic subgroups\nThe three cyclic subgroups of order $4$ are\n$$\nS = \\{\\langle i\\rangle,\\;\\langle j\\rangle,\\;\\langle k\\rangle\\}.\n$$\nFor any $\\varphi\\in\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)$ and any $x\\in\\{i,j,k\\}$, $\\varphi(\\langle x\\rangle) = \\langle\\varphi(x)\\rangle$ is again one of the three subgroups because $\\varphi(x)$ has order $4$ and its generated subgroup is determined by which pair $\\{\\pm x\\}$ it belongs to. This defines an action of $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)$ on $S$, and hence a homomorphism\n$$\nf\\colon \\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8) \\longrightarrow \\operatorname{Sym}(S)\\cong S_3.\n$$\n\n*Kernel of $f$.* An automorphism lies in $\\ker f$ iff it fixes each of the three subgroups setwise. For $\\langle i\\rangle$ this means $\\varphi(i)\\in\\{\\pm i\\}$, for $\\langle j\\rangle$ means $\\varphi(j)\\in\\{\\pm j\\}$, and then automatically $\\varphi(k)=\\varphi(i)\\varphi(j)\\in\\{\\pm k\\}$. Thus such an automorphism is determined by choosing signs for $i$ and $j$. There are at most $4$ possibilities. The four inner automorphisms $c_1=\\operatorname{id}$, $c_i$, $c_j$, $c_k$ achieve exactly these sign changes (e.g. $c_i(i)=i$, $c_i(j)=-j$, etc.). Therefore $\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8)\\subseteq\\ker f$ and $|\\ker f|\\le 4$.\n\n*Surjectivity of $f$.* We exhibit automorphisms that realise a transposition and a $3$\u2011cycle on $S$.\n\n- Let $\\sigma$ be defined by $\\sigma(i)=j$, $\\sigma(j)=i$. Since $j$ has order $4$ and $i\\notin\\langle j\\rangle$, $\\sigma$ is an automorphism (by part\u00a02). It sends $\\langle i\\rangle$ to $\\langle j\\rangle$, $\\langle j\\rangle$ to $\\langle i\\rangle$, and $\\langle k\\rangle$ to $\\langle \\sigma(i)\\sigma(j)\\rangle = \\langle j i\\rangle = \\langle -k\\rangle = \\langle k\\rangle$. Hence $f(\\sigma)$ is the transposition swapping $\\langle i\\rangle$ and $\\langle j\\rangle$.\n\n- Let $\\tau$ be defined by $\\tau(i)=j$, $\\tau(j)=k$. Again $j$ and $k$ have order $4$ and $k\\notin\\langle j\\rangle$, so $\\tau$ is an automorphism. It sends $\\langle i\\rangle\\mapsto\\langle j\\rangle$, $\\langle j\\rangle\\mapsto\\langle k\\rangle$, and $\\langle k\\rangle\\mapsto\\langle \\tau(i)\\tau(j)\\rangle = \\langle j k\\rangle = \\langle i\\rangle$. Thus $f(\\tau)$ is the $3$\u2011cycle $(\\langle i\\rangle\\;\\langle j\\rangle\\;\\langle k\\rangle)$.\n\nSince $f(\\sigma)$ and $f(\\tau)$ generate $S_3$, $f$ is surjective.\n\nNow $|\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)|=24$ and $|\\operatorname{Im}f|=6$, so $|\\ker f| = 24/6 = 4$. Together with $\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8)\\subseteq\\ker f$ and $|\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8)|=4$, we obtain\n$$\n\\ker f = \\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8) \\cong V_4.\n$$\nThus we have an exact sequence\n$$\n1 \\longrightarrow \\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8) \\longrightarrow \\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8) \\overset{f}{\\longrightarrow} S_3 \\longrightarrow 1.\n$$\n\n---\n\n### 4. $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)\\cong S_4$\n\nFrom part\u00a03, $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)$ has a normal subgroup $N=\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8)\\cong V_4$ with quotient $G/N\\cong S_3$. Consider the conjugation action of $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)$ on $N$. For $\\varphi\\in\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)$ and $c_g\\in N$,\n$$\n\\varphi\\, c_g\\,\\varphi^{-1} = c_{\\varphi(g)}.\n$$\nUnder the isomorphism $N\\cong V_4$, the three non\u2011identity elements correspond to the cosets $iZ$, $jZ$, $kZ$. The map $c_g \\mapsto c_{\\varphi(g)}$ permutes these three elements exactly as $f(\\varphi)$ permutes the subgroups $\\langle i\\rangle,\\langle j\\rangle,\\langle k\\rangle$. Hence the action of $G/N\\cong S_3$ on $N$ is precisely the standard permutation action on the three non\u2011identity elements of $V_4$.\n\nTherefore $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)$ is isomorphic to the semidirect product $V_4\\rtimes S_3$ with this action. It is well known (and easy to verify) that this semidirect product is isomorphic to the symmetric group $S_4$: $S_4$ contains a normal Klein four subgroup (the double transpositions) whose quotient is $S_3$, and the conjugation action of $S_4$ on that $V_4$ induces the natural permutation of its three non\u2011identity elements. Consequently,\n$$\n\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8) \\cong S_4.\n$$\n\nThis completes the proof.",

Indeed, if $\\varphi(j)\\in\\langle\\varphi(i)\\rangle$, then the image of $\\varphi$ would be contained in the cyclic subgroup $\\langle\\varphi(i)\\rangle$ which has at most $4$ elements, contradicting surjectivity.\n\nConversely, we show that for any choice of $a,b\\in Q_8$ with $|a|=4$, $|b|=4$ and $b\\notin\\langle a\\rangle$, there exists a (unique) automorphism $\\varphi$ with $\\varphi(i)=a$, $\\varphi(j)=b$.\n\n*Existence.* Because $a$ and $b$ are of order $4$, we have $a^2=b^2=-1$. Since $b\\notin\\langle a\\rangle$, we have $b\\neq \\pm a$. In $Q_8$, any two distinct order\u2011$4$ elements that are not inverses of each other anti\u2011commute: $ab=-ba$. (This can be verified directly from the multiplication table: for example $i j = k$, $j i = -k$, etc., and the same holds with signs.) Thus $a$ and $b$ satisfy the defining relations of $Q_8$: $a^2=b^2=-1$ and $ab=-ba$. Hence the assignment $i\\mapsto a$, $j\\mapsto b$ extends to a homomorphism $\\varphi\\colon Q_8\\to Q_8$. The subgroup generated by $a$ and $b$ is $\\{\\pm1,\\pm a,\\pm b,\\pm ab\\}$, which contains $8$ distinct elements and therefore equals $Q_8$. Thus $\\varphi$ is surjective, and because $Q_8$ is finite it is also injective, i.e. an automorphism.\n\n*Uniqueness* follows because $i,j$ generate $Q_8$.\n\nNow count the number of such ordered pairs $(a,b)$.  \n- There are $6$ elements of order $4$: $\\pm i,\\pm j,\\pm k$. Choose $a$ arbitrarily: $6$ possibilities.  \n- Once $a$ is fixed, the subgroup $\\langle a\\rangle$ contains exactly two elements of order $4$, namely $a$ and $-a$. The condition $b\\notin\\langle a\\rangle$ excludes these two, leaving $6-2=4$ choices for $b$.\n\nHence $|\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)| = 6\\cdot 4 = 24$.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Inner automorphism group and the action on the three cyclic subgroups\n\n#### Inner automorphisms\nFor $g\\in Q_8$, let $c_g(x)=gxg^{-1}$ be the inner automorphism induced by $g$. The centre of $Q_8$ is $Z(Q_8)=\\{\\pm1\\}$, so $c_g=c_h$ iff $g\\equiv h\\pmod{Z}$. Consequently\n\\[\n\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8) \\cong Q_8/Z(Q_8),\n\\]\na group of order $4$. In $Q_8/Z$, every non\u2011trivial element has order $2$ because $(gZ)^2 = g^2Z = (-1)Z = Z$. Thus $\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8)$ is isomorphic to the Klein four group $V_4$. Explicitly, the three non\u2011trivial inner automorphisms are $c_i$, $c_j$, $c_k$ (with $c_i^2=c_j^2=c_k^2=\\operatorname{id}$ and $c_i c_j = c_{ij}=c_k$, etc.).\n\n#### Action on the cyclic subgroups\nThe three cyclic subgroups of order $4$ are\n\\[\nS = \\{\\langle i\\rangle,\\;\\langle j\\rangle,\\;\\langle k\\rangle\\}.\n\\]\nFor any $\\varphi\\in\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)$ and any $x\\in\\{i,j,k\\}$, $\\varphi(\\langle x\\rangle) = \\langle\\varphi(x)\\rangle$ is again one of the three subgroups because $\\varphi(x)$ has order $4$ and its generated subgroup is determined by which pair $\\{\\pm x\\}$ it belongs to. This defines an action of $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)$ on $S$, and hence a homomorphism\n\\[\nf\\colon \\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8) \\longrightarrow \\operatorname{Sym}(S)\\cong S_3.\n\\]\n\n*Kernel of $f$.* An automorphism lies in $\\ker f$ iff it fixes each of the three subgroups setwise. For $\\langle i\\rangle$ this means $\\varphi(i)\\in\\{\\pm i\\}$, for $\\langle j\\rangle$ means $\\varphi(j)\\in\\{\\pm j\\}$, and then automatically $\\varphi(k)=\\varphi(i)\\varphi(j)\\in\\{\\pm k\\}$. Thus such an automorphism is determined by choosing signs for $i$ and $j$. There are at most $4$ possibilities. The four inner automorphisms $c_1=\\operatorname{id}$, $c_i$, $c_j$, $c_k$ achieve exactly these sign changes (e.g. $c_i(i)=i$, $c_i(j)=-j$, etc.). Therefore $\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8)\\subseteq\\ker f$ and $|\\ker f|\\le 4$.\n\n*Surjectivity of $f$.* We exhibit automorphisms that realise a transposition and a $3$\u2011cycle on $S$.\n\n- Let $\\sigma$ be defined by $\\sigma(i)=j$, $\\sigma(j)=i$. Since $j$ has order $4$ and $i\\notin\\langle j\\rangle$, $\\sigma$ is an automorphism (by part\u00a02). It sends $\\langle i\\rangle$ to $\\langle j\\rangle$, $\\langle j\\rangle$ to $\\langle i\\rangle$, and $\\langle k\\rangle$ to $\\langle \\sigma(i)\\sigma(j)\\rangle = \\langle j i\\rangle = \\langle -k\\rangle = \\langle k\\rangle$. Hence $f(\\sigma)$ is the transposition swapping $\\langle i\\rangle$ and $\\langle j\\rangle$.\n\n- Let $\\tau$ be defined by $\\tau(i)=j$, $\\tau(j)=k$. Again $j$ and $k$ have order $4$ and $k\\notin\\langle j\\rangle$, so $\\tau$ is an automorphism. It sends $\\langle i\\rangle\\mapsto\\langle j\\rangle$, $\\langle j\\rangle\\mapsto\\langle k\\rangle$, and $\\langle k\\rangle\\mapsto\\langle \\tau(i)\\tau(j)\\rangle = \\langle j k\\rangle = \\langle i\\rangle$. Thus $f(\\tau)$ is the $3$\u2011cycle $(\\langle i\\rangle\\;\\langle j\\rangle\\;\\langle k\\rangle)$.\n\nSince $f(\\sigma)$ and $f(\\tau)$ generate $S_3$, $f$ is surjective.\n\nNow $|\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)|=24$ and $|\\operatorname{Im}f|=6$, so $|\\ker f| = 24/6 = 4$. Together with $\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8)\\subseteq\\ker f$ and $|\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8)|=4$, we obtain\n\\[\n\\ker f = \\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8) \\cong V_4.\n\\]\nThus we have an exact sequence\n\\[\n1 \\longrightarrow \\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8) \\longrightarrow \\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8) \\overset{f}{\\longrightarrow} S_3 \\longrightarrow 1.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### 4. $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)\\cong S_4$\n\nFrom part\u00a03, $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)$ has a normal subgroup $N=\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8)\\cong V_4$ with quotient $G/N\\cong S_3$. Consider the conjugation action of $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)$ on $N$. For $\\varphi\\in\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)$ and $c_g\\in N$,\n\\[\n\\varphi\\, c_g\\,\\varphi^{-1} = c_{\\varphi(g)}.\n\\]\nUnder the isomorphism $N\\cong V_4$, the three non\u2011identity elements correspond to the cosets $iZ$, $jZ$, $kZ$. The map $c_g \\mapsto c_{\\varphi(g)}$ permutes these three elements exactly as $f(\\varphi)$ permutes the subgroups $\\langle i\\rangle,\\langle j\\rangle,\\langle k\\rangle$. Hence the action of $G/N\\cong S_3$ on $N$ is precisely the standard permutation action on the three non\u2011identity elements of $V_4$.\n\nTherefore $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)$ is isomorphic to the semidirect product $V_4\\rtimes S_3$ with this action. It is well known (and easy to verify) that this semidirect product is isomorphic to the symmetric group $S_4$: $S_4$ contains a normal Klein four subgroup (the double transpositions) whose quotient is $S_3$, and the conjugation action of $S_4$ on that $V_4$ induces the natural permutation of its three non\u2011identity elements.

To compare $c_k\\tau^{-1}$ and $\\tau^{-1}c_i$, we use $\\tau^{-1}c_i = c_{\\tau^{-1}(i)}\\tau^{-1} = c_{k}\\tau^{-1}$ (since $\\tau^{-1}(i)=k$). Hence both sides coincide, establishing $\\sigma\\tau'\\sigma = \\tau'^{-1}$.\n\nThus $\\sigma$ and $\\tau'$ satisfy the defining relations of $S_3$: $\\sigma^2=(\\tau')^3=(\\sigma\\tau')^2=\\operatorname{id}$ (the last from $\\sigma\\tau'\\sigma=\\tau'^{-1}$). The subgroup $H=\\langle\\sigma,\\tau'\\rangle$ is therefore a homomorphic image of $S_3$. Because $f(\\sigma)=(1\\,2)$ and $f(\\tau')=(1\\,2\\,3)$ are distinct and generate $S_3$, the restriction $f|_H$ is surjective. Moreover, if $h\\in H$ and $f(h)=1$, then $h$ belongs to $\\ker f=\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8)$. But the only inner automorphism that could lie in $H$ is the identity: indeed, the six elements $\\operatorname{id},\\tau',(\\tau')^2,\\sigma,\\sigma\\tau',\\sigma(\\tau')^2$ have images under $f$ equal to $\\operatorname{id},(1\\,2\\,3),(1\\,3\\,2),(1\\,2),(2\\,3),(1\\,3)$ respectively, all distinct; hence $f|_H$ is injective, so $|H|=6$ and $H\\cap\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8)=\\{\\operatorname{id}\\}$.

The centre of $Q_8$ is $Z(Q_8)=\\{\\pm1\\}$, so $c_g=c_h$ iff $g\\equiv h\\pmod{Z}$. Consequently\n$$\n\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8) \\cong Q_8/Z(Q_8),\n$$\na group of order $4$. In $Q_8/Z$, every non\u2011trivial element has order $2$ because $(gZ)^2 = g^2Z = (-1)Z = Z$. Thus $\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8)$ is isomorphic to the Klein four group $V_4$. Explicitly, the three non\u2011trivial inner automorphisms are $c_i$, $c_j$, $c_k$ (with $c_i^2=c_j^2=c_k^2=\\operatorname{id}$ and $c_i c_j = c_{ij}=c_k$, etc.).\n\n#### Action on the cyclic subgroups\nThe three cyclic subgroups of order $4$ are\n$$\nS = \\{\\langle i\\rangle,\\;\\langle j\\rangle,\\;\\langle k\\rangle\\}.\n$$\nFor any $\\varphi\\in\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)$ and any $x\\in\\{i,j,k\\}$, $\\varphi(\\langle x\\rangle) = \\langle\\varphi(x)\\rangle$ is again one of the three subgroups because $\\varphi(x)$ has order $4$ and its generated subgroup is determined by which pair $\\{\\pm x\\}$ it belongs to. This defines an action of $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)$ on $S$, and hence a homomorphism\n$$\nf\\colon \\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8) \\longrightarrow \\operatorname{Sym}(S)\\cong S_3.\n$$\n\n*Kernel of $f$.* An automorphism lies in $\\ker f$ iff it fixes each of the three subgroups setwise. For $\\langle i\\rangle$ this means $\\varphi(i)\\in\\{\\pm i\\}$, for $\\langle j\\rangle$ means $\\varphi(j)\\in\\{\\pm j\\}$, and then automatically $\\varphi(k)=\\varphi(i)\\varphi(j)\\in\\{\\pm k\\}$. Thus such an automorphism is determined by choosing signs for $i$ and $j$. There are at most $4$ possibilities. The four inner automorphisms $c_1=\\operatorname{id}$, $c_i$, $c_j$, $c_k$ achieve exactly these sign changes (e.g. $c_i(i)=i$, $c_i(j)=-j$, etc.). Therefore $\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8)\\subseteq\\ker f$ and $|\\ker f|\\le 4$.\n\n*Surjectivity of $f$.* We exhibit automorphisms that realise a transposition and a $3$\u2011cycle on $S$.\n\n- Let $\\sigma$ be defined by $\\sigma(i)=j$, $\\sigma(j)=i$. Since $j$ has order $4$ and $i\\notin\\langle j\\rangle$, $\\sigma$ is an automorphism (by part\u00a02). It sends $\\langle i\\rangle$ to $\\langle j\\rangle$, $\\langle j\\rangle$ to $\\langle i\\rangle$, and $\\langle k\\rangle$ to $\\langle \\sigma(i)\\sigma(j)\\rangle = \\langle j i\\rangle = \\langle -k\\rangle = \\langle k\\rangle$. Hence $f(\\sigma)$ is the transposition swapping $\\langle i\\rangle$ and $\\langle j\\rangle$.\n\n- Let $\\tau$ be defined by $\\tau(i)=j$, $\\tau(j)=k$. Again $j$ and $k$ have order $4$ and $k\\notin\\langle j\\rangle$, so $\\tau$ is an automorphism. It sends $\\langle i\\rangle\\mapsto\\langle j\\rangle$, $\\langle j\\rangle\\mapsto\\langle k\\rangle$, and $\\langle k\\rangle\\mapsto\\langle \\tau(i)\\tau(j)\\rangle = \\langle j k\\rangle = \\langle i\\rangle$. Thus $f(\\tau)$ is the $3$\u2011cycle $(\\langle i\\rangle\\;\\langle j\\rangle\\;\\langle k\\rangle)$.\n\nSince $f(\\sigma)$ and $f(\\tau)$ generate $S_3$, $f$ is surjective.\n\nNow $|\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)|=24$ and $|\\operatorname{Im}f|=6$, so $|\\ker f| = 24/6 = 4$. Together with $\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8)\\subseteq\\ker f$ and $|\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8)|=4$, we obtain\n$$\n\\ker f = \\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8) \\cong V_4.\n$$\nThus we have an exact sequence\n$$\n1 \\longrightarrow \\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8) \\longrightarrow \\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8) \\overset{f}{\\longrightarrow} S_3 \\longrightarrow 1.\n$$\n\n---\n\n### 4. $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)\\cong S_4$\n\nFrom part\u00a03 we have an exact sequence\n$$\n1 \\longrightarrow \\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8) \\overset{\\cong}{\\longrightarrow} V_4 \\longrightarrow \\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8) \\overset{f}{\\longrightarrow} S_3 \\longrightarrow 1,\n$$\nwhere $f$ records the permutation of the three cyclic subgroups $\\langle i\\rangle,\\langle j\\rangle,\\langle k\\rangle$. The action of $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)$ on $\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8)$ by conjugation is compatible with $f$: for $\\varphi\\in\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)$ and $c_g\\in\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8)$, one has $\\varphi c_g\\varphi^{-1}=c_{\\varphi(g)}$, and the induced map on the three non\u2011identity elements of $\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8)$ is exactly $f(\\varphi)$. Thus $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)$ is an extension of $V_4$ by $S_3$ with this action.\n\nWe now show that the extension splits, i.e. there exists a subgroup $H\\le\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)$ isomorphic to $S_3$ such that $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)=\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8)\\rtimes H$. Define the following automorphisms:\n- $\\tau$ by $\\tau(i)=j$, $\\tau(j)=k$, $\\tau(k)=i$ (this is the $3$\u2011cycle used in part\u00a03; it has order $3$).\n- $\\sigma$ by $\\sigma(i)=j$, $\\sigma(j)=i$, $\\sigma(k)=-k$ (the transposition used in part\u00a03; it has order $2$).\n\nThese satisfy $f(\\tau)=(1\\,2\\,3)$ and $f(\\sigma)=(1\\,2)$. A direct computation gives\n$$\n\\sigma\\tau\\sigma = c_i \\circ \\tau^{-1},\n$$\nwhere $c_i$ denotes conjugation by $i$ (an inner automorphism). Indeed, applying both sides to $i,j,k$ yields the same images. Now set\n$$\n\\tau' = c_i \\circ \\tau.\n$$\nSince $c_i$ is inner and $f(c_i)=1$, we still have $f(\\tau')=(1\\,2\\,3)$. Moreover, one checks that $\\tau'$ has order $3$:\n$$\n\\tau'^3 = (c_i\\tau)^3 = c_i(\\tau c_i\\tau^{-1})(\\tau^2 c_i\\tau^{-2})\\,\\tau^3 = c_i c_{\\tau(i)} c_{\\tau^2(i)} = c_i c_j c_k = c_{ijk} = c_{-1}= \\operatorname{id},\n$$\nusing $\\tau(i)=j$, $\\tau^2(i)=k$ and $ijk=-1$. Also $\\tau'\\neq\\operatorname{id}$.\n\nNow we verify the relation\n$$\n\\sigma\\tau'\\sigma = \\tau'^{-1}.\n$$\nUsing $\\sigma\\tau\\sigma = c_i\\tau^{-1}$ and $\\sigma c_i = c_{\\sigma(i)}\\sigma = c_j\\sigma$ (because $\\sigma(i)=j$), we compute\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sigma\\tau'\\sigma &= \\sigma c_i \\tau \\sigma = (\\sigma c_i\\sigma^{-1})(\\sigma\\tau\\sigma) = c_{\\sigma(i)} (c_i \\tau^{-1}) = c_j c_i \\tau^{-1} = c_{ji} \\tau^{-1} = c_{-k} \\tau^{-1} = c_k \\tau^{-1},\n\\end{align*}\nsince $c_{-k}=c_k$ (as $-1$ is central). On the other hand,\n$$\n\\tau'^{-1} = (c_i\\tau)^{-1} = \\tau^{-1}c_i^{-1} = \\tau^{-1}c_{i^{-1}} = \\tau^{-1}c_{-i} = \\tau^{-1}c_i,\n$$\nbecause $c_{-i}=c_i$ again. To compare $c_k\\tau^{-1}$ and $\\tau^{-1}c_i$, we use $\\tau^{-1}c_i = c_{\\tau^{-1}(i)}\\tau^{-1} = c_{k}\\tau^{-1}$ (since $\\tau^{-1}(i)=k$). Hence both sides coincide, establishing $\\sigma\\tau'\\sigma = \\tau'^{-1}$.\n\nThus $\\sigma$ and $\\tau'$ satisfy the defining relations of $S_3$: $\\sigma^2=(\\tau')^3=(\\sigma\\tau')^2=\\operatorname{id}$ (the last from $\\sigma\\tau'\\sigma=\\tau'^{-1}$). The subgroup $H=\\langle\\sigma,\\tau'\\rangle$ is therefore a homomorphic image of $S_3$. Because $f(\\sigma)=(1\\,2)$ and $f(\\tau')=(1\\,2\\,3)$ are distinct and generate $S_3$, the restriction $f|_H$ is surjective. Moreover, if $h\\in H$ and $f(h)=1$, then $h$ belongs to $\\ker f=\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8)$. But the only inner automorphism that could lie in $H$ is the identity: indeed, the six elements $\\operatorname{id},\\tau',(\\tau')^2,\\sigma,\\sigma\\tau',\\sigma(\\tau')^2$ have images under $f$ equal to $\\operatorname{id},(1\\,2\\,3),(1\\,3\\,2),(1\\,2),(2\\,3),(1\\,3)$ respectively, all distinct; hence $f|_H$ is injective, so $|H|=6$ and $H\\cap\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8)=\\{\\operatorname{id}\\}$. Consequently $H\\cong S_3$ and the exact sequence splits, yielding\n$$\n\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8) \\cong \\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8) \\rtimes H \\cong V_4 \\rtimes S_3,\n$$\nwhere the action of $S_3$ on $V_4$ is the standard permutation of the three non\u2011identity elements (as given by conjugation).\n\nFinally, it is a standard fact that such a semidirect product is isomorphic to the symmetric group $S_4$. Indeed, $S_4$ contains a normal Klein four subgroup (the double transpositions) whose quotient is $S_3$, and the conjugation action of $S_4$ on that $V_4$ permutes its three non\u2011identity elements exactly as above. Since both groups have order $24$ and share this structure, they are isomorphic. Thus\n$$\n\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8) \\cong S_4.\n$$\n\nThis completes the proof.",

Existence, uniqueness and harmonicity of the minimizer\n\n**Step 1. Reformulation in $H^1(\\Omega)$.**  \nLet $g$ be the boundary function: $g(x)=1$ on $|x|=a$, $g(x)=0$ on $|x|=b$.  \nDefine the affine subspace\n$$\nV = \\{ u \\in H^1(\\Omega) : \\text{Tr}\\,u = g \\;\\text{in}\\; L^2(\\partial\\Omega) \\},\n$$\nwhere $\\text{Tr}: H^1(\\Omega) \\to L^2(\\partial\\Omega)$ is the trace operator.  \nThe set $\\mathcal A$ is contained in $V$ because every $C^1$ function has a well\u2011defined trace equal to its boundary values.  \n$V$ is non\u2011empty: for instance the radial function\n$$\nw(x) = \\frac{b-|x|}{b-a} \\in C^\\infty(\\overline\\Omega)\n$$\nsatisfies the boundary conditions, hence $w \\in V$.\n\n**Step 2. Coercivity.**  \nWrite any $u \\in V$ as $u = w + v$ with $v \\in H^1_0(\\Omega)$.  \nUsing the inequality $(a+b)^2 \\ge \\tfrac12 a^2 - b^2$ we obtain\n$$\nE[u] = \\int_\\Omega |\\nabla w + \\nabla v|^2 \\ge \\tfrac12 \\|\\nabla v\\|_{L^2}^2 - \\|\\nabla w\\|_{L^2}^2.\n$$\nThus if $E[u]$ is bounded, then $\\|\\nabla v\\|_{L^2}$ is bounded.  \nBy the Poincar\u00e9 inequality on $H^1_0(\\Omega)$ (valid because $\\Omega$ is bounded) we have $\\|v\\|_{L^2} \\le C\\|\\nabla v\\|_{L^2}$, so $\\|v\\|_{H^1}$ is bounded and consequently $\\|u\\|_{H^1}$ is bounded.\n\n**Step 3. Existence of a minimizer in $V$.**  \nLet $m = \\inf_{u\\in V} E[u]$. Choose a minimizing sequence $\\{u_k\\}\\subset V$ with $E[u_k]\\to m$.  \nWrite $u_k = w + v_k$, $v_k\\in H^1_0$. By coercivity, $\\{v_k\\}$ is bounded in $H^1_0$.  \nSince $H^1_0$ is reflexive, we may extract a subsequence (still denoted $v_k$) converging weakly to some $v\\in H^1_0$.  \nThen $u_k \\rightharpoonup u := w+v$ weakly in $H^1(\\Omega)$.  \nThe trace operator is linear and continuous, hence also weakly continuous, so $\\text{Tr}\\,u = \\text{Tr}\\,w = g$; therefore $u\\in V$.  \nThe functional $E$ is convex and strongly continuous on $H^1$, therefore it is weakly lower semicontinuous:\n$$\nE[u] \\le \\liminf_{k\\to\\infty} E[u_k] = m.\n$$\nThus $u$ attains the infimum, i.e. $u$ is a minimizer of $E$ over $V$.\n\n**Step 4. Uniqueness.**  \nSuppose $u_1, u_2 \\in V$ are two minimizers. Set $w = u_1-u_2$; then $w\\in H^1_0(\\Omega)$.  \nBy the parallelogram identity,\n$$\n\\int_\\Omega |\\nabla w|^2 = 2\\int_\\Omega |\\nabla u_1|^2 + 2\\int_\\Omega |\\nabla u_2|^2 - 4\\int_\\Omega \\Bigl|\\nabla\\Bigl(\\frac{u_1+u_2}{2}\\Bigr)\\Bigr|^2.\n$$\nSince $u_1,u_2$ are minimizers, $E[u_1]=E[u_2]=m$ and $\\frac{u_1+u_2}{2}\\in V$ (because $V$ is affine), we have\n$E\\bigl(\\frac{u_1+u_2}{2}\\bigr) \\ge m$. Hence the right\u2011hand side is $\\le 2m+2m-4m = 0$, so $\\int_\\Omega |\\nabla w|^2 = 0$.  \nThus $\\nabla w = 0$ a.e., and because $w=0$ on $\\partial\\Omega$ (in the trace sense), $w\\equiv 0$. Hence the minimizer is unique.\n\n**Step 5. Euler\u2013Lagrange equation and harmonicity.**  \nFor any test function $\\varphi \\in C_c^\\infty(\\Omega)$ and $\\varepsilon$ small, $u+\\varepsilon\\varphi \\in V$ (since $\\varphi$ vanishes on $\\partial\\Omega$).  \nBecause $u$ minimizes $E$, the first variation vanishes:\n$$\n0 = \\frac{d}{d\\varepsilon}\\Big|_{\\varepsilon=0} E[u+\\varepsilon\\varphi] = 2\\int_\\Omega \\nabla u\\cdot\\nabla\\varphi.\n$$\nThus $\\int_\\Omega \\nabla u\\cdot\\nabla\\varphi = 0$ for all $\\varphi\\in C_c^\\infty(\\Omega)$, which means $u$ is a weak solution of $\\Delta u = 0$ in $\\Omega$.\n\n**Step 6. Regularity and membership in $\\mathcal A$.**  \nBy Weyl\u2019s lemma, any weak solution of Laplace\u2019s equation is $C^\\infty$ inside $\\Omega$.  \nMoreover, since $\\partial\\Omega$ is smooth and the boundary data $g$ are constant (hence smooth), standard elliptic regularity yields $u \\in C^\\infty(\\overline\\Omega)$. In particular, $u \\in C^1(\\overline\\Omega) \\cap C^2(\\Omega)$ and the boundary values are attained classically. Therefore $u \\in \\mathcal A$.  \n\nWe denote this unique minimizer by $u_*$. It satisfies $\\Delta u_* = 0$ in $\\Omega$, i.e. it is harmonic.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Explicit form of $u_*$\n\nBecause the domain and the boundary conditions are rotationally invariant, $u_*$ must be radial.  \nIndeed, for any rotation $R\\in SO(n)$, the function $x \\mapsto u_*(Rx)$ is also harmonic with the same boundary values; by uniqueness it coincides with $u_*$. Hence $u_*(x) = f(r)$ with $r = |x|$.\n\nThe Laplace equation for a radial function in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ reduces to\n$$\nf''(r) + \\frac{n-1}{r}\\, f'(r) = 0 \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad \\bigl(r^{n-1} f'(r)\\bigr)' = 0.\n$$\nThus $f'(r) = C r^{1-n}$ and integration gives\n$$\nf(r) = A + B\\, r^{2-n},\n$$\nwhere $A,B$ are constants (recall $n\\ge 3$).\n\nImposing the boundary conditions $f(a)=1$, $f(b)=0$:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nA + B a^{2-n} = 1,\\$$2pt]\nA + B b^{2-n} = 0.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nSubtracting yields $B(a^{2-n} - b^{2-n}) = 1$, so\n$$\nB = \\frac{1}{a^{2-n} - b^{2-n}}, \\qquad\nA = -B b^{2-n} = -\\frac{b^{2-n}}{a^{2-n} - b^{2-n}}.\n$$\nTherefore\n$$\nf(r) = \\frac{r^{2-n} - b^{2-n}}{a^{2-n} - b^{2-n}}.\n$$\nA more compact expression is obtained by multiplying numerator and denominator by $a^{n-2}b^{n-2}$:\n$$\nu_*(x) = \\frac{ \\bigl(b/|x|\\bigr)^{n-2} - 1 }{ \\bigl(b/a\\bigr)^{n-2} - 1 }.\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### 3. Minimum value of the energy\n\nSince $u_*$ is harmonic, we may use Green\u2019s first identity:\n$$\nE[u_*] = \\int_\\Omega |\\nabla u_*|^2 = \\int_{\\partial\\Omega} u_*\\,\\frac{\\partial u_*}{\\partial n}\\, dS,\n$$\nwhere $n$ is the outward unit normal.  \nThe boundary consists of two spheres: $S_a = \\{ |x|=a \\}$ and $S_b = \\{ |x|=b \\}$.  \nOn $S_b$, $u_* = 0$ so the integral vanishes. On $S_a$, $u_* = 1$ and the outward normal points toward the origin, i.e. $n = -x/|x|$. Hence\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u_*}{\\partial n}\\Big|_{S_a} = \\nabla u_*\\cdot n = f'(a)\\,\\frac{x}{|x|}\\cdot\\Bigl(-\\frac{x}{|x|}\\Bigr) = -f'(a).\n$$\nThus\n$$\nE[u_*] = \\int_{S_a} 1\\cdot\\bigl(-f'(a)\\bigr)\\, dS = -f'(a)\\cdot |S_a|,\n$$\nwhere $|S_a| = \\omega_n a^{n-1}$ is the surface area of the sphere of radius $a$.\n\nFrom (1) we compute the derivative. Write\n$$\nf(r) = \\frac{b^{n-2}r^{2-n} - 1}{D}, \\qquad D = (b/a)^{n-2} - 1 > 0.\n$$\nThen\n$$\nf'(r) = \\frac{b^{n-2}(2-n) r^{1-n}}{D} = -\\frac{(n-2)b^{n-2} r^{1-n}}{D}.\n$$\nConsequently\n$$\n-f'(a) = \\frac{(n-2)b^{n-2} a^{1-n}}{D}.\n$$\nSubstituting into the expression for the energy gives\n$$\nE[u_*] = \\frac{(n-2)b^{n-2} a^{1-n}}{D}\\cdot \\omega_n a^{n-1} = \\frac{(n-2)\\,\\omega_n\\, b^{n-2}}{D}.\n$$\nReplacing $D = (b/a)^{n-2} - 1$ and simplifying,\n$$\nE[u_*] = \\frac{(n-2)\\,\\omega_n\\, b^{n-2}}{(b/a)^{n-2} - 1}\n      = (n-2)\\,\\omega_n\\,\\frac{(ab)^{n-2}}{b^{n-2} - a^{n-2}}.\n\\tag{2}\n$$\n\nSince $u_*$ is the unique minimizer, this value equals $\\inf_{u\\in\\mathcal A} E[u]$.\n\n---\n\n**Final answers**\n\n- The unique minimizer is\n  $$\n  u_*(x) = \\frac{ \\bigl(b/|x|\\bigr)^{n-2} - 1 }{ \\bigl(b/a\\bigr)^{n-2} - 1 }.\n  $$\n\n- The minimum energy is\n  $$\n  \\inf_{u\\in\\mathcal A} E[u] = (n-2)\\,\\omega_n\\,\\frac{(ab)^{n-2}}{b^{n-2} - a^{n-2}}.\n  $$",

The set $\\{(z,w):|z|=\\rho,\\;|w|\\le S\\}$ is a compact subset of $A$, hence $f$ is bounded there; say $|f(z,w)|\\le M$ for all such $(z,w)$.

Moreover, the bidisc $\\Delta^2$ is a domain of holomorphy: for instance, it is convex (hence holomorphically convex) or, more concretely, the function $\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty(z^{2^n}+w^{2^n})$ is holomorphic on $\\Delta^2$ and cannot be extended beyond any boundary point.  Thus $\\Delta^2$ itself is a domain of holomorphy with the required extension property.\n\nTo see that $\\Delta^2$ is **exactly** the envelope of $D$, suppose there existed a domain $U\\supsetneq\\Delta^2$ to which every holomorphic function on $D$ extends.  Because $\\Delta^2$ is a domain of holomorphy, there is a function $g\\in\\mathcal O(\\Delta^2)$ that admits no holomorphic extension to any larger domain.  Its restriction $g|_D$ would then extend to $U$, yielding an extension of $g$ to $U$, a contradiction.  Hence no such $U$ exists; $\\Delta^2$ is maximal.\n\nTherefore the envelope of holomorphy of $D$ (as a domain in $\\mathbb C^2$) is precisely $\\Delta^2$.",

Reformulation as a measure.**  \nDefine the Borel measure $\\mu$ on $G$ by $d\\mu = f\\,dm$. Because $f\\ge 0$ and $\\int f\\,dm=1$, $\\mu$ is a probability measure, absolutely continuous with respect to $m$. The convolution condition $f*f=f$ translates into $\\mu*\\mu=\\mu$ (since for $L^1$ functions the convolution of the densities corresponds to the convolution of the measures).\n\n**Step 2. Fourier transform.**  \nLet $\\widehat{G}$ be the dual group of continuous characters of $G$; it is discrete because $G$ is compact. For $\\chi\\in\\widehat{G}$ set  \n\n$$\n\\widehat{\\mu}(\\chi)=\\int_G \\overline{\\chi(x)}\\,d\\mu(x)=\\int_G f(x)\\overline{\\chi(x)}\\,dm(x).\n$$\n\nConvolution of measures becomes pointwise multiplication of their Fourier transforms:  \n\n$$\n(\\mu*\\mu)\\widehat{\\;}(\\chi)=\\widehat{\\mu}(\\chi)^2.\n$$\n\nHence the idempotence $\\mu*\\mu=\\mu$ yields  \n\n$$\n\\widehat{\\mu}(\\chi)^2=\\widehat{\\mu}(\\chi)\\qquad\\text{for all }\\chi\\in\\widehat{G},\n$$\n\nso that $\\widehat{\\mu}(\\chi)\\in\\{0,1\\}$.\n\n**Step 3. The trivial character.**  \nFrom $\\int f\\,dm=1$ we obtain $\\widehat{\\mu}(\\mathbf{1})=1$, where $\\mathbf{1}$ denotes the trivial character.\n\n**Step 4. Characterisation of the set where $\\widehat{\\mu}=1$.**  \nBecause $\\mu$ is a positive measure and $|\\chi(x)|=1$ for all $x$, we have  \n\n$$\n|\\widehat{\\mu}(\\chi)|\\le\\int_G|\\chi(x)|\\,d\\mu(x)=1.\n$$\n\nEquality $|\\widehat{\\mu}(\\chi)|=1$ occurs if and only if $\\chi$ is constant $\\mu$-almost everywhere. For $\\widehat{\\mu}(\\chi)=1$ (a positive real) this constant must be $1$. Thus  \n\n$$\n\\widehat{\\mu}(\\chi)=1\\quad\\Longleftrightarrow\\quad \\chi(x)=1\\;\\text{for }\\mu\\text{-a.e. }x.\n$$\n\nLet $S=\\operatorname{supp}(\\mu)$ be the closed support of $\\mu$ (the smallest closed set of full $\\mu$-measure). By continuity of $\\chi$, the condition $\\chi=1$ $\\mu$-a.e. is equivalent to $\\chi(s)=1$ for every $s\\in S$. Consequently  \n\n$$\n\\widehat{\\mu}(\\chi)=1\\;\\Longleftrightarrow\\;\\chi|_S\\equiv1.\n$$\n\nTherefore the set  \n\n$$\n\\mathcal{A}:=\\{\\chi\\in\\widehat{G}:\\widehat{\\mu}(\\chi)=1\\}\n$$\n\nis exactly the annihilator of $S$:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{A}=\\operatorname{Ann}(S)=\\{\\chi\\in\\widehat{G}:\\chi(s)=1\\;\\forall s\\in S\\}.\n$$\n\nIn particular, $\\mathcal{A}$ is a subgroup of $\\widehat{G}$.\n\n**Step 5. Finiteness of $\\mathcal{A}$.**  \nSince $f\\in L^1(G)$, the Riemann\u2013Lebesgue lemma for compact abelian groups tells us that $\\widehat{\\mu}(\\chi)\\to0$ as $\\chi\\to\\infty$ (i.e., outside every finite set only finitely many characters satisfy $|\\widehat{\\mu}(\\chi)|\\ge\\varepsilon$). Because $\\widehat{\\mu}$ takes only the values $0$ and $1$, this forces $\\mathcal{A}$ to be finite. Indeed, an infinite $\\mathcal{A}$ would give infinitely many characters with $\\widehat{\\mu}=1$, contradicting $\\widehat{\\mu}(\\chi)\\to0$.\n\n**Step 6. Recovering $f$ from its Fourier transform.**  \nDefine  \n\n$$\nH:=\\operatorname{Ann}(\\mathcal{A})=\\{x\\in G:\\chi(x)=1\\;\\forall\\chi\\in\\mathcal{A}\\}.\n$$\n\nBy Pontryagin duality, $H$ is a closed subgroup of $G$. As $\\mathcal{A}$ is finite, the quotient $G/H$ is isomorphic to the dual of $\\mathcal{A}$ (which is finite), so $H$ has finite index in $G$. In a topological group a closed subgroup of finite index is also open; hence $H$ is an open (and closed) subgroup of $G$.\n\nNow consider the function  \n\n$$\nf_H(x)=\\frac{1}{m(H)}\\,\\mathbf{1}_H(x).\n$$\n\nIts Fourier transform is  \n\n$$\n\\widehat{f_H}(\\chi)=\\frac{1}{m(H)}\\int_H\\overline{\\chi(x)}\\,dm(x)=\n\\begin{cases}\n1, & \\text{if }\\chi|_H\\equiv1,\\\\\n0, & \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nBut $\\chi|_H\\equiv1$ precisely when $\\chi\\in\\operatorname{Ann}(H)$. Because $\\mathcal{A}$ is finite, Pontryagin duality gives $\\operatorname{Ann}(H)=\\operatorname{Ann}(\\operatorname{Ann}(\\mathcal{A}))=\\mathcal{A}$. Hence $\\widehat{f_H}=\\mathbf{1}_{\\mathcal{A}}=\\widehat{\\mu}$.\n\nThe Fourier transform is injective on $L^1(G)$ (e.g., trigonometric polynomials are dense in $C(G)$ and an approximate identity argument shows that if $\\widehat{f}=0$ then $f=0$ a.e.). Therefore $f=f_H$ $m$-almost everywhere.\n\n**Step 7. Converse \u2013 verification that every such function works.**  \nLet $H$ be any open (hence closed) subgroup of $G$. Then $m(H)>0$ because a non\u2011empty open set has positive Haar measure. Define  \n\n$$\nf(x)=\\frac{1}{m(H)}\\,\\mathbf{1}_H(x).\n$$\n\nClearly $f\\ge0$ and $\\int_G f\\,dm=1$. For the convolution we compute  \n\n$$\n(f*f)(x)=\\frac{1}{m(H)^2}\\int_G\\mathbf{1}_H(y)\\,\\mathbf{1}_H(x-y)\\,dm(y)\n        =\\frac{1}{m(H)^2}\\,m\\bigl(H\\cap(x-H)\\bigr).\n$$\n\nSince $H$ is a subgroup, $H\\cap(x-H)=H$ when $x\\in H$ and is empty otherwise. Thus  \n\n$$\n(f*f)(x)=\\frac{1}{m(H)}\\,\\mathbf{1}_H(x)=f(x).\n$$\n\nHence every such $f$ satisfies the three conditions.\n\n**Step 8. Description of all solutions.**  \nThe functions $f$ are exactly the normalized characteristic functions of open subgroups of $G$:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{f(x)=\\frac{1}{m(H)}\\,\\mathbf{1}_H(x)\\quad\\text{$m$-a.e., where $H$ is an open subgroup of $G$.}}\n$$\n\n**Step 9. The connected case.**  \nIf $G$ is connected, the only clopen subsets of $G$ are $\\varnothing$ and $G$ itself.

        "raw_answer": "We are given a compact abelian Hausdorff topological group \\(G\\) (written additively) with normalized Haar probability measure \\(m\\). For \\(f\\in L^1(G)\\) we assume\n\n1. \\(f(x)\\ge 0\\) for \\(m\\)-a.e. \\(x\\in G\\),\n2. \\(\\displaystyle\\int_G f\\,dm=1\\),\n3. \\(f*f=f\\) \\(m\\)-a.e.\n\nWe are to determine all such \\(f\\) up to \\(m\\)-a.e. equality, and to deduce that if \\(G\\) is connected then necessarily \\(f=1\\) a.e.\n\n---\n\n### Solution\n\n**Step 1. Reformulation as a measure.**  \nDefine the Borel measure \\(\\mu\\) on \\(G\\) by \\(d\\mu = f\\,dm\\). Because \\(f\\ge 0\\) and \\(\\int f\\,dm=1\\), \\(\\mu\\) is a probability measure, absolutely continuous with respect to \\(m\\). The convolution condition \\(f*f=f\\) translates into \\(\\mu*\\mu=\\mu\\) (since for \\(L^1\\) functions the convolution of the densities corresponds to the convolution of the measures).\n\n**Step 2. Fourier transform.**  \nLet \\(\\widehat{G}\\) be the dual group of continuous characters of \\(G\\); it is discrete because \\(G\\) is compact. For \\(\\chi\\in\\widehat{G}\\) set  \n\n\\[\n\\widehat{\\mu}(\\chi)=\\int_G \\overline{\\chi(x)}\\,d\\mu(x)=\\int_G f(x)\\overline{\\chi(x)}\\,dm(x).\n\\]\n\nConvolution of measures becomes pointwise multiplication of their Fourier transforms:  \n\n\\[\n(\\mu*\\mu)\\widehat{\\;}(\\chi)=\\widehat{\\mu}(\\chi)^2.\n\\]\n\nHence the idempotence \\(\\mu*\\mu=\\mu\\) yields  \n\n\\[\n\\widehat{\\mu}(\\chi)^2=\\widehat{\\mu}(\\chi)\\qquad\\text{for all }\\chi\\in\\widehat{G},\n\\]\n\nso that \\(\\widehat{\\mu}(\\chi)\\in\\{0,1\\}\\).\n\n**Step 3. The trivial character.**  \nFrom \\(\\int f\\,dm=1\\) we obtain \\(\\widehat{\\mu}(\\mathbf{1})=1\\), where \\(\\mathbf{1}\\) denotes the trivial character.\n\n**Step 4. Characterisation of the set where \\(\\widehat{\\mu}=1\\).**  \nBecause \\(\\mu\\) is a positive measure and \\(|\\chi(x)|=1\\) for all \\(x\\), we have  \n\n\\[\n|\\widehat{\\mu}(\\chi)|\\le\\int_G|\\chi(x)|\\,d\\mu(x)=1.\n\\]\n\nEquality \\(|\\widehat{\\mu}(\\chi)|=1\\) occurs if and only if \\(\\chi\\) is constant \\(\\mu\\)-almost everywhere. For \\(\\widehat{\\mu}(\\chi)=1\\) (a positive real) this constant must be \\(1\\). Thus  \n\n\\[\n\\widehat{\\mu}(\\chi)=1\\quad\\Longleftrightarrow\\quad \\chi(x)=1\\;\\text{for }\\mu\\text{-a.e. }x.\n\\]\n\nLet \\(S=\\operatorname{supp}(\\mu)\\) be the closed support of \\(\\mu\\) (the smallest closed set of full \\(\\mu\\)-measure). By continuity of \\(\\chi\\), the condition \\(\\chi=1\\) \\(\\mu\\)-a.e. is equivalent to \\(\\chi(s)=1\\) for every \\(s\\in S\\). Consequently  \n\n\\[\n\\widehat{\\mu}(\\chi)=1\\;\\Longleftrightarrow\\;\\chi|_S\\equiv1.\n\\]\n\nTherefore the set  \n\n\\[\n\\mathcal{A}:=\\{\\chi\\in\\widehat{G}:\\widehat{\\mu}(\\chi)=1\\}\n\\]\n\nis exactly the annihilator of \\(S\\):\n\n\\[\n\\mathcal{A}=\\operatorname{Ann}(S)=\\{\\chi\\in\\widehat{G}:\\chi(s)=1\\;\\forall s\\in S\\}.\n\\]\n\nIn particular, \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) is a subgroup of \\(\\widehat{G}\\).\n\n**Step 5. Finiteness of \\(\\mathcal{A}\\).**  \nSince \\(f\\in L^1(G)\\), the Riemann\u2013Lebesgue lemma for compact abelian groups tells us that \\(\\widehat{\\mu}(\\chi)\\to0\\) as \\(\\chi\\to\\infty\\) (i.e., outside every finite set only finitely many characters satisfy \\(|\\widehat{\\mu}(\\chi)|\\ge\\varepsilon\\)). Because \\(\\widehat{\\mu}\\) takes only the values \\(0\\) and \\(1\\), this forces \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) to be finite. Indeed, an infinite \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) would give infinitely many characters with \\(\\widehat{\\mu}=1\\), contradicting \\(\\widehat{\\mu}(\\chi)\\to0\\).\n\n**Step 6. Recovering \\(f\\) from its Fourier transform.**  \nDefine  \n\n\\[\nH:=\\operatorname{Ann}(\\mathcal{A})=\\{x\\in G:\\chi(x)=1\\;\\forall\\chi\\in\\mathcal{A}\\}.\n\\]\n\nBy Pontryagin duality, \\(H\\) is a closed subgroup of \\(G\\). As \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) is finite, the quotient \\(G/H\\) is isomorphic to the dual of \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) (which is finite), so \\(H\\) has finite index in \\(G\\). In a topological group a closed subgroup of finite index is also open; hence \\(H\\) is an open (and closed) subgroup of \\(G\\).\n\nNow consider the function  \n\n\\[\nf_H(x)=\\frac{1}{m(H)}\\,\\mathbf{1}_H(x).\n\\]\n\nIts Fourier transform is  \n\n\\[\n\\widehat{f_H}(\\chi)=\\frac{1}{m(H)}\\int_H\\overline{\\chi(x)}\\,dm(x)=\n\\begin{cases}\n1, & \\text{if }\\chi|_H\\equiv1,\\\\\n0, & \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nBut \\(\\chi|_H\\equiv1\\) precisely when \\(\\chi\\in\\operatorname{Ann}(H)\\). Because \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) is finite, Pontryagin duality gives \\(\\operatorname{Ann}(H)=\\operatorname{Ann}(\\operatorname{Ann}(\\mathcal{A}))=\\mathcal{A}\\). Hence \\(\\widehat{f_H}=\\mathbf{1}_{\\mathcal{A}}=\\widehat{\\mu}\\).\n\nThe Fourier transform is injective on \\(L^1(G)\\) (e.g., trigonometric polynomials are dense in \\(C(G)\\) and an approximate identity argument shows that if \\(\\widehat{f}=0\\) then \\(f=0\\) a.e.). Therefore \\(f=f_H\\) \\(m\\)-almost everywhere.\n\n**Step 7. Converse \u2013 verification that every such function works.**  \nLet \\(H\\) be any open (hence closed) subgroup of \\(G\\). Then \\(m(H)>0\\) because a non\u2011empty open set has positive Haar measure. Define  \n\n\\[\nf(x)=\\frac{1}{m(H)}\\,\\mathbf{1}_H(x).\n\\]\n\nClearly \\(f\\ge0\\) and \\(\\int_G f\\,dm=1\\). For the convolution we compute  \n\n\\[\n(f*f)(x)=\\frac{1}{m(H)^2}\\int_G\\mathbf{1}_H(y)\\,\\mathbf{1}_H(x-y)\\,dm(y)\n        =\\frac{1}{m(H)^2}\\,m\\bigl(H\\cap(x-H)\\bigr).\n\\]\n\nSince \\(H\\) is a subgroup, \\(H\\cap(x-H)=H\\) when \\(x\\in H\\) and is empty otherwise. Thus  \n\n\\[\n(f*f)(x)=\\frac{1}{m(H)}\\,\\mathbf{1}_H(x)=f(x).\n\\]\n\nHence every such \\(f\\) satisfies the three conditions.\n\n**Step 8. Description of all solutions.**  \nThe functions \\(f\\) are exactly the normalized characteristic functions of open subgroups of \\(G\\):\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{f(x)=\\frac{1}{m(H)}\\,\\mathbf{1}_H(x)\\quad\\text{\\(m\\)-a.e., where \\(H\\) is an open subgroup of \\(G\\).}}\n\\]\n\n**Step 9. The connected case.**  \nIf \\(G\\) is connected, the only clopen subsets of \\(G\\) are \\(\\varnothing\\) and \\(G\\) itself. An open subgroup is clopen, so the only open subgroups are \\(G\\) (the trivial subgroup \\(\\{0\\}\\) has measure \\(0\\) and cannot give \\(\\int f=1\\)). Consequently \\(H=G\\) and therefore  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{f=1\\quad\\text{\\(m\\)-a.e.}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\nThus the problem is completely solved.",

Eigenvalues $\\lambda\\neq0$ and orthonormal eigenfunctions\n\nLet $\\lambda\\neq0$ and $f\\in H$, $f\\neq0$, satisfy $Tf=\\lambda f$.\n\n**Regularity.**  \nBecause the kernel is bounded and continuous in $x$, the function $Tf$ is continuous (dominated convergence). Hence $f=\\lambda^{-1}Tf$ is also continuous. Using the equivalent expression  \n\n$$\n(Tf)(x) = \\int_0^x y f(y)\\,dy + x\\int_x^1 f(y)\\,dy ,\n$$\n\nwhich follows from splitting the integral at $y=x$, we see that $Tf$ is differentiable. For continuous $f$ the first term has derivative $x f(x)$ and the second term (product $x\\cdot\\int_x^1 f(y)\\,dy$) has derivative $\\int_x^1 f(y)\\,dy - x f(x)$. Consequently  \n\n$$\n(Tf)'(x) = \\int_x^1 f(y)\\,dy ,\n$$\n\nwhich is continuous. Thus $Tf\\in C^1$ and $f\\in C^1$. Differentiating once more gives  \n\n$$\n(Tf)''(x) = -f(x) ,\n$$\n\nso $Tf\\in C^2$ and $f\\in C^2$. Therefore $f$ satisfies the differential equation  \n\n$$\n\\lambda f''(x) + f(x) = 0 \\qquad (0<x<1)\n$$\n\nin the classical sense.\n\n**Boundary conditions.**  \nFrom the definition, $Tf(0)=0$ implies $\\lambda f(0)=0$ and, since $\\lambda\\neq0$, $f(0)=0$. Also $(Tf)'(1)=\\int_1^1 f(y)\\,dy=0$ gives $\\lambda f'(1)=0$, hence $f'(1)=0$.\n\n**Solving the Sturm\u2013Liouville problem.**  \nBecause $T$ is positive, $\\lambda = \\langle Tf,f\\rangle/\\|f\\|^2 \\ge 0$ and $\\lambda\\neq0$, so $\\lambda>0$. Set $\\mu = 1/\\lambda >0$. The equation becomes  \n\n$$\nf'' + \\mu f = 0,\\qquad f(0)=0,\\; f'(1)=0 .\n$$\n\nThe general solution is $f(x)=A\\sin(\\sqrt\\mu\\, x)+B\\cos(\\sqrt\\mu\\, x)$. The condition $f(0)=0$ forces $B=0$, so $f(x)=A\\sin(\\sqrt\\mu\\, x)$. Then $f'(x)=A\\sqrt\\mu\\cos(\\sqrt\\mu\\, x)$, and $f'(1)=0$ yields $\\cos\\sqrt\\mu = 0$. Hence  \n\n$$\n\\sqrt\\mu = \\frac{(2n-1)\\pi}{2},\\quad n=1,2,3,\\dots .\n$$\n\nThus the eigenvalues are  \n\n$$\n\\lambda_n = \\frac{1}{\\mu_n} = \\frac{4}{(2n-1)^2\\pi^2},\\qquad n\\in\\mathbb{N},\n$$\n\nand a corresponding set of eigenfunctions (up to scaling) is  \n\n$$\nf_n(x) = \\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{(2n-1)\\pi}{2}\\,x\\right).\n$$\n\n**Orthonormal family.**  \nThese eigenfunctions are mutually orthogonal (they belong to distinct eigenvalues of a self\u2011adjoint operator). Their $L^2$-norm is  \n\n$$\n\\|f_n\\|^2 = \\int_0^1 \\sin^2\\!\\left(\\frac{(2n-1)\\pi}{2}\\,x\\right)dx \n= \\frac12 ,\n$$\n\nas can be computed directly using $\\sin^2\\theta = \\frac{1-\\cos2\\theta}{2}$ and noting that $\\sin((2n-1)\\pi)=0$. Therefore an orthonormal family of eigenfunctions is  \n\n$$\n\\varphi_n(x) = \\sqrt{2}\\,\\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{(2n-1)\\pi}{2}\\,x\\right),\\qquad n=1,2,3,\\dots .\n$$\n\nThese are **all** non\u2011zero eigenvalues of $T$; any eigenfunction must satisfy the above boundary value problem, whose eigenvalues are exactly the $\\mu_n$.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Spectrum $\\sigma(T)$ and operator norm $\\|T\\|$\n\n$T$ is a compact self\u2011adjoint operator on the infinite\u2011dimensional Hilbert space $H$. By the spectral theorem for such operators, the spectrum $\\sigma(T)$ consists of the set of eigenvalues together with $0$ (which may or may not be an eigenvalue). We have found the non\u2011zero eigenvalues  \n\n$$\n\\lambda_n = \\frac{4}{(2n-1)^2\\pi^2},\\quad n\\ge1,\n$$\n\nwhich accumulate at $0$. The operator is injective (see the positivity argument), so $0$ is not an eigenvalue. However, $0$ belongs to the spectrum because a compact operator on an infinite\u2011dimensional space cannot have a bounded inverse (otherwise the identity would be compact). Consequently  \n\n$$\n\\sigma(T) = \\{0\\} \\cup \\left\\{ \\frac{4}{(2n-1)^2\\pi^2} : n=1,2,3,\\dots \\right\\}.\n$$\n\nSince $T$ is positive and self\u2011adjoint, its operator norm equals its spectral radius:\n\n$$\n\\|T\\| = \\sup_{\\lambda\\in\\sigma(T)}|\\lambda| = \\lambda_1 = \\frac{4}{\\pi^2}.\n$$\n\nAlternatively, $\\|T\\| = \\max_{\\|f\\|=1}\\langle Tf,f\\rangle = \\lambda_1$, attained by the eigenfunction $\\varphi_1$.\n\n---\n\nThis completes the solution.",

Moreover, this representation shows that \\(T\\) is injective: if \\(Tf=0\\) then \\(\\langle Tf,f\\rangle=0\\), forcing \\(\\int_t^1 f(s)\\,ds=0\\) for a.e. \\(t\\), and differentiation yields \\(f=0\\) a.e.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Eigenvalues \\(\\lambda\\neq0\\) and orthonormal eigenfunctions\n\nLet \\(\\lambda\\neq0\\) and \\(f\\in H\\), \\(f\\neq0\\), satisfy \\(Tf=\\lambda f\\).\n\n**Regularity.**  \nBecause the kernel is bounded and continuous in \\(x\\), the function \\(Tf\\) is continuous (dominated convergence). Hence \\(f=\\lambda^{-1}Tf\\) is also continuous. Using the equivalent expression  \n\n\\[\n(Tf)(x) = \\int_0^x y f(y)\\,dy + x\\int_x^1 f(y)\\,dy ,\n\\]\n\nwhich follows from splitting the integral at \\(y=x\\), we see that \\(Tf\\) is differentiable. For continuous \\(f\\) the first term has derivative \\(x f(x)\\) and the second term (product \\(x\\cdot\\int_x^1 f(y)\\,dy\\)) has derivative \\(\\int_x^1 f(y)\\,dy - x f(x)\\). Consequently  \n\n\\[\n(Tf)'(x) = \\int_x^1 f(y)\\,dy ,\n\\]\n\nwhich is continuous. Thus \\(Tf\\in C^1\\) and \\(f\\in C^1\\). Differentiating once more gives  \n\n\\[\n(Tf)''(x) = -f(x) ,\n\\]\n\nso \\(Tf\\in C^2\\) and \\(f\\in C^2\\). Therefore \\(f\\) satisfies the differential equation  \n\n\\[\n\\lambda f''(x) + f(x) = 0 \\qquad (0<x<1)\n\\]\n\nin the classical sense.\n\n**Boundary conditions.**  \nFrom the definition, \\(Tf(0)=0\\) implies \\(\\lambda f(0)=0\\) and, since \\(\\lambda\\neq0\\), \\(f(0)=0\\). Also \\((Tf)'(1)=\\int_1^1 f(y)\\,dy=0\\) gives \\(\\lambda f'(1)=0\\), hence \\(f'(1)=0\\).\n\n**Solving the Sturm\u2013Liouville problem.**  \nBecause \\(T\\) is positive, \\(\\lambda = \\langle Tf,f\\rangle/\\|f\\|^2 \\ge 0\\) and \\(\\lambda\\neq0\\), so \\(\\lambda>0\\). Set \\(\\mu = 1/\\lambda >0\\). The equation becomes  \n\n\\[\nf'' + \\mu f = 0,\\qquad f(0)=0,\\; f'(1)=0 .\n\\]\n\nThe general solution is \\(f(x)=A\\sin(\\sqrt\\mu\\, x)+B\\cos(\\sqrt\\mu\\, x)\\). The condition \\(f(0)=0\\) forces \\(B=0\\), so \\(f(x)=A\\sin(\\sqrt\\mu\\, x)\\). Then \\(f'(x)=A\\sqrt\\mu\\cos(\\sqrt\\mu\\, x)\\), and \\(f'(1)=0\\) yields \\(\\cos\\sqrt\\mu = 0\\). Hence  \n\n\\[\n\\sqrt\\mu = \\frac{(2n-1)\\pi}{2},\\quad n=1,2,3,\\dots .\n\\]\n\nThus the eigenvalues are  \n\n\\[\n\\lambda_n = \\frac{1}{\\mu_n} = \\frac{4}{(2n-1)^2\\pi^2},\\qquad n\\in\\mathbb{N},\n\\]\n\nand a corresponding set of eigenfunctions (up to scaling) is  \n\n\\[\nf_n(x) = \\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{(2n-1)\\pi}{2}\\,x\\right).\n\\]\n\n**Orthonormal family.**  \nThese eigenfunctions are mutually orthogonal (they belong to distinct eigenvalues of a self\u2011adjoint operator). Their \\(L^2\\)-norm is  \n\n\\[\n\\|f_n\\|^2 = \\int_0^1 \\sin^2\\!\\left(\\frac{(2n-1)\\pi}{2}\\,x\\right)dx \n= \\frac12 ,\n\\]\n\nas can be computed directly using \\(\\sin^2\\theta = \\frac{1-\\cos2\\theta}{2}\\) and noting that \\(\\sin((2n-1)\\pi)=0\\).

We solve case by case.\n\n- **$\\kappa > 0$:** Write $\\kappa = k^2$ with $k>0$. The ODE is $f''+k^2 f=0$. General solution: $f(r)=A\\cos(kr)+B\\sin(kr)$.  \n  $f(0)=A=0$ \u21d2 $A=0$.  \n  $f'(r)=Bk\\cos(kr)$, so $f'(0)=Bk=1$ \u21d2 $B=1/k$.  \n  Hence $f(r)=\\frac{1}{k}\\sin(kr) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\kappa}}\\sin(\\sqrt{\\kappa}\\,r)$.\n\n- **$\\kappa = 0$:** The ODE is $f''=0$. General solution: $f(r)=Ar+B$.  \n  $f(0)=B=0$ \u21d2 $B=0$.  \n  $f'(0)=A=1$ \u21d2 $A=1$.  \n  Hence $f(r)=r$.\n\n- **$\\kappa < 0$:** Write $\\kappa = -k^2$ with $k>0$.

This function is positive exactly for $r\\in(0,\\pi/\\sqrt{\\kappa})$. At $r=\\pi/\\sqrt{\\kappa}$ we have $f=0$ and $f'(\\pi/\\sqrt{\\kappa}) = \\cos(\\pi) = -1$, satisfying the second endpoint conditions. For any larger $a$, $f$ would become negative on part of $(0,a)$, contradicting $f:(0,a)\\to(0,\\infty)$. Hence the only possible finite $a$ is $a = \\pi/\\sqrt{\\kappa}$. (The case $a=\\infty$ is impossible because $f$ would not stay positive.)

Let $\\mathcal{B}$ be a countable base for $X$.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Existence of an exhaustion by compact sets.}  \n    Because $X$ is $\\sigma$-compact and locally compact Hausdorff, we can construct a sequence $\\{K_n\\}_{n=1}^\\infty$ of compact subsets such that\n    \\[\n    K_n \\subseteq \\operatorname{int}(K_{n+1}) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad X = \\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty K_n.\n    \\]\n    (Proof: Write $X = \\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty C_n$ with each $C_n$ compact. Set $K_1 = C_1$. Inductively, given compact $K_n$, the set $L_n = K_n \\cup C_{n+1}$ is compact. Cover $L_n$ by finitely many open sets with compact closures (possible by local compactness); let $W_n$ be their union. Then $W_n$ is open, $\\overline{W_n}$ is compact, and $L_n \\subseteq W_n$. Define $K_{n+1} = \\overline{W_n}$. Then $K_n \\subseteq L_n \\subseteq W_n \\subseteq \\operatorname{int}(K_{n+1})$ because $W_n$ is open and $W_n \\subseteq K_{n+1}$. The $K_n$ cover all $C_n$, hence cover $X$.)\n\n    \\item \\textbf{A countable base for $\\alpha X$.}  \n    For each $n$ define $V_n = \\alpha X \\setminus K_n$. Since $K_n$ is compact, $V_n$ is an open neighbourhood of $\\infty$.  \n    Consider the family\n    \\[\n    \\mathcal{B}' = \\mathcal{B} \\cup \\{V_n : n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}.\n    \\]\n    $\\mathcal{B}'$ is countable. We verify that it is a base for the topology of $\\alpha X$.\n\n    Let $U \\subseteq \\alpha X$ be open and $p \\in U$.\n    \\begin{itemize}\n        \\item If $p \\in X$, then $U \\cap X$ is open in $X$ (because $X$ is open in $\\alpha X$). Since $\\mathcal{B}$ is a base for $X$, there exists $B \\in \\mathcal{B}$ with $p \\in B \\subseteq U \\cap X \\subseteq U$. Thus $B \\in \\mathcal{B}'$ works.\n        \\item If $p = \\infty$, then $U$ contains $\\infty$, so $U = \\alpha X \\setminus K$ for some compact $K \\subseteq X$. By the exhaustion property, there exists $n$ such that $K \\subseteq K_n$ (because $\\{\\operatorname{int}(K_n)\\}$ is an open cover of $K$, hence a finite subcover reduces to a single $K_n$ since the interiors are increasing). Then $V_n = \\alpha X \\setminus K_n \\subseteq \\alpha X \\setminus K = U$, and $\\infty \\in V_n$. Hence $V_n \\in \\mathcal{B}'$ satisfies $p \\in V_n \\subseteq U$.\n    \\end{itemize}\n    Therefore $\\mathcal{B}'$ is a countable base for $\\alpha X$.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Metrizability of $\\alpha X$.}  \n    From part 1, $\\alpha X$ is compact Hausdorff, hence normal and in particular regular. A regular second countable space is metrizable by Urysohn's metrization theorem. Since we have just shown that $\\alpha X$ is second countable, it follows that $\\alpha X$ is metrizable.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nThis completes the proof of both directions. \\qed",

Then either $|m|\\ge 1$ or $|n|\\ge 1$ (or both). In either case $(m,n)$ does **not** satisfy $|m|<1$ and $|n|<1$ simultaneously, so $(m,n)\\notin K$.

        "raw_answer": "We prove the planar Minkowski theorem in two parts.\n\n---\n\n### Part 1: If $\\operatorname{area}(K)>4$, then $K$ contains a nonzero lattice point.\n\nAssume $K\\subset\\mathbb{R}^2$ is measurable, convex, centrally symmetric about the origin and $\\operatorname{area}(K)>4$.\n\nDefine $S = \\frac12 K = \\bigl\\{ \\frac{x}{2} : x\\in K\\bigr\\}$.  \nBecause scaling by $\\frac12$ is a linear map, $S$ is measurable and  \n\\[\n\\operatorname{area}(S)=\\Bigl(\\frac12\\Bigr)^{\\!2}\\operatorname{area}(K)=\\frac14\\operatorname{area}(K)>1.\n\\]\n\nWe first show that there exist two distinct points $a,b\\in S$ with $a-b\\in\\mathbb{Z}^2\\setminus\\{0\\}$.\n\nSuppose, for contradiction, that **no** two distinct points of $S$ differ by a nonzero integer vector.  \nThen for any distinct $v,w\\in\\mathbb{Z}^2$ the translates $S+v$ and $S+w$ are disjoint.  \nIndeed, if $(S+v)\\cap(S+w)\\neq\\varnothing$, then $x+v=y+w$ for some $x,y\\in S$, so $x-y=w-v\\in\\mathbb{Z}^2\\setminus\\{0\\}$, contradicting the assumption.\n\nLet $Q=[0,1)^2$ be the half\u2011open unit square. For each $v\\in\\mathbb{Z}^2$ set  \n\\[\nT_v = (S+v)\\cap Q.\n\\]  \nBecause the translates $S+v$ are pairwise disjoint, the sets $T_v$ are also pairwise disjoint: if $x\\in T_v\\cap T_w$, then $x\\in (S+v)\\cap(S+w)$, forcing $v=w$.  \nClearly $T_v\\subseteq Q$, so by additivity and monotonicity of measure,\n\\[\n\\sum_{v\\in\\mathbb{Z}^2}\\operatorname{area}(T_v)\\le\\operatorname{area}(Q)=1. \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\nOn the other hand, translation invariance gives  \n\\[\n\\operatorname{area}(T_v)=\\operatorname{area}\\bigl((S+v)\\cap Q\\bigr)=\\operatorname{area}\\bigl(S\\cap(Q-v)\\bigr).\n\\]  \nThe family $\\{Q-v : v\\in\\mathbb{Z}^2\\}$ is a partition of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ (the translates of $Q$ are disjoint and cover $\\mathbb{R}^2$). Hence\n\\[\n\\operatorname{area}(S)=\\sum_{v\\in\\mathbb{Z}^2}\\operatorname{area}\\bigl(S\\cap(Q-v)\\bigr)=\\sum_{v\\in\\mathbb{Z}^2}\\operatorname{area}(T_v). \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\nCombining (1) and (2) we obtain $\\operatorname{area}(S)\\le 1$, contradicting $\\operatorname{area}(S)>1$.  \nTherefore our supposition was false; there exist distinct $a,b\\in S$ such that $u:=a-b\\in\\mathbb{Z}^2\\setminus\\{0\\}$.\n\nNow we prove that this $u$ belongs to $K$.  \nSince $a,b\\in S$, by definition $2a,2b\\in K$.  \nCentral symmetry of $K$ gives $-2b\\in K$ (because $2b\\in K$).  \nFinally, convexity of $K$ implies that the midpoint of $2a$ and $-2b$ lies in $K$:\n\\[\n\\frac12(2a)+\\frac12(-2b)=a-b=u\\in K.\n\\]  \nThus $K$ contains a nonzero lattice point, which completes the proof of part\u202f1.\n\n---\n\n### Part 2: The constant $4$ is best possible.\n\nConsider the open square  \n\\[\nK = (-1,1)\\times(-1,1)=\\bigl\\{(x,y)\\in\\mathbb{R}^2 : |x|<1,\\ |y|<1\\bigr\\}.\n\\]\n\n- $K$ is open, hence Lebesgue measurable.  \n- $K$ is convex (it is a product of two open intervals, which are convex; alternatively, the line segment between any two points of $K$ stays inside because both coordinates satisfy $|x|<1$, $|y|<1$).  \n- $K$ is centrally symmetric about the origin: $(x,y)\\in K\\Rightarrow (-x,-y)\\in K$.  \n- $\\operatorname{area}(K)=2\\cdot2=4$.\n\nNow take any nonzero lattice point $(m,n)\\in\\mathbb{Z}^2\\setminus\\{0\\}$. Then either $|m|\\ge 1$ or $|n|\\ge 1$ (or both). In either case $(m,n)$ does **not** satisfy $|m|<1$ and $|n|<1$ simultaneously, so $(m,n)\\notin K$. Hence\n\\[\nK\\cap(\\mathbb{Z}^2\\setminus\\{0\\})=\\varnothing.\n\\]\n\nThis example shows that the bound $4$ cannot be lowered: there exists a set satisfying all hypotheses with area exactly $4$ that contains no nonzero lattice point. Therefore the constant $4$ is optimal.\n\n---\n\nThe proof is complete.",
