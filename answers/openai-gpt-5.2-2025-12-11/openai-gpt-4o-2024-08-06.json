        "answer": "To determine the number of distinct admissible colorings of a necklace with 10 beads, where each bead is either black or white, and the coloring has exactly 4 black beads with no two black beads adjacent, we need to consider the symmetries of the necklace. Two colorings are considered the same if one can be obtained from the other by a rotation or reflection of the necklace.\n\n### Step 1: Count the Total Number of Admissible Colorings\n\nFirst, we count the total number of ways to arrange 4 black beads and 6 white beads such that no two black beads are adjacent. \n\nConsider the 6 white beads as dividers, creating 6 gaps between them (including the gap between the last and first bead due to the circular arrangement). We need to place the 4 black beads into these 6 gaps, ensuring no two black beads are adjacent. This is equivalent to choosing 4 gaps out of the 6 to place a black bead.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 4 gaps out of 6 is given by the binomial coefficient:\n\n$$\n\\binom{6}{4} = 15\n$$\n\nThus, there are 15 admissible colorings without considering symmetry.\n\n### Step 2: Account for Dihedral Symmetry\n\nThe dihedral group $D_{10}$ has 20 elements, consisting of 10 rotations and 10 reflections.

We will consider the effect of each type of symmetry:\n\n#### Rotations\n\n- **Rotation by 0 positions (identity):** All 15 colorings are fixed.\n- **Rotation by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 positions:** No coloring is fixed because a rotation by any non-zero number of positions would place at least one black bead adjacent to another.\n\nThus, only the identity rotation fixes any colorings, and it fixes all 15.\n\n#### Reflections\n\nConsider a reflection that swaps positions $i$ and $10-i+1$ for $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, 5$. For a coloring to be fixed by a reflection, the pattern must be symmetric about the reflection axis.\n\n- **Reflection through a vertex (e.g., between beads 1 and 10):** No coloring is fixed because it would require a symmetric arrangement of black beads, which would force adjacency.\n- **Reflection through a midpoint of opposite sides (e.g., between beads 1 and 6):** Similarly, no coloring is fixed because it would require a symmetric arrangement of black beads, which would force adjacency.\n\nThus, no reflections fix any colorings.\n\n### Step 3: Apply Burnside's Lemma\n\nAccording to Burnside's Lemma, the number of distinct colorings is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{20} \\left( \\text{Number of colorings fixed by identity} + \\text{Number of colorings fixed by all other symmetries} \\right)\n$$\n\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{20} (15 + 0) = \\frac{15}{20} = \\frac{3}{4}\n$$\n\nSince the number of distinct colorings must be an integer, we need to re-evaluate our approach.

        "answer": "To determine the greatest common divisor (GCD) of $2^m - 1$ and $2^n + 1$, we need to analyze the properties of these expressions in terms of divisibility.\n\nLet's denote $d = \\gcd(2^m - 1, 2^n + 1)$. By definition, $d$ divides both $2^m - 1$ and $2^n + 1$. Therefore, $d$ must also divide any integer linear combination of these two numbers. In particular, $d$ divides:\n\n1. $2^m - 1$,\n2. $2^n + 1$,\n3. $2^m(2^n + 1) - (2^n + 1)(2^m - 1) = 2^{m+n} + 2^m - 2^n - 1 - 2^m + 1 = 2^{m+n} - 2^n$.\n\nThus, $d$ divides $2^{m+n} - 2^n = 2^n(2^m - 1)$. Since $d$ divides $2^m - 1$, it must also divide $2^n \\cdot (2^m - 1)$. Therefore, $d$ divides $2^{m+n} - 2^n$.\n\nNow, let's consider the expression $2^{m+n} - 2^n$. We can factor this as:\n\n$$2^{m+n} - 2^n = 2^n(2^m - 1).$$\n\nSince $d$ divides $2^n(2^m - 1)$ and $d$ divides $2^m - 1$, it follows that $d$ must divide $2^n$. However, $d$ also divides $2^n + 1$, which is odd. Therefore, $d$ must be odd, and hence $d$ cannot have any factors of 2. This implies that $d$ divides the odd part of $2^n$, which is 1. Therefore, $d$ must divide 1.\n\nThus, the only possible value for $d$ is 1, unless there is a specific condition under which $d$ could be greater than 1. To explore this, we need to consider the possibility of $d$ being greater than 1.\n\nSuppose $d > 1$. Then $d$ must divide both $2^m - 1$ and $2^n + 1$.

The field of fractions of $A$ is $k(x,y,z)/(xy - z^n)$, which is isomorphic to $k(x,y)$ since $z^n = xy$ implies $z = (xy)^{1/n}$ in the field of fractions. \n\nThe ring $A$ is a hypersurface singularity, and it is known that hypersurfaces defined by a single polynomial in three variables are normal if the polynomial is irreducible and the field is algebraically closed. Since $xy - z^n$ is irreducible and $k$ is algebraically closed, $A$ is normal.\n\n**Singular Locus of $X$:**\n\nThe singular locus of a hypersurface $V(f)$ in $\\mathbb{A}^3$ is given by the points where the gradient $\\nabla f = (f_x, f_y, f_z)$ vanishes. Here, $f = xy - z^n$, so:\n\n- $f_x = y$,\n- $f_y = x$,\n- $f_z = -nz^{n-1}$.\n\nThe singular locus is where $y = 0$, $x = 0$, and $z = 0$. The only point satisfying these conditions is the origin $(0,0,0)$. Thus, the singular locus of $X$ consists of exactly one point, the origin.\n\n### Part 2: Compute $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$ explicitly (as an abstract abelian group).\n\nSince $A$ is a normal domain, $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$ is the divisor class group of $A$. For a hypersurface singularity of the form $xy = z^n$, it is known that $\\mathrm{Cl}(A) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$. This is because the relation $xy = z^n$ imposes a cyclic structure on the divisor class group, with the generator being the class of a divisor associated with one of the variables.\n\n### Part 3: Determine the order of $[D]\\in \\mathrm{Cl}(A)$ and show that $[D]$ generates $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$.\n\nThe divisor $D$ is defined by the height-$1$ prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p} = (x,z)$. The order of $[D]$ in $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$ is $n$, as $\\mathrm{Cl}(A) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ and $[D]$ corresponds to the generator of this cyclic group.\n\nTo show that $[D]$ generates $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$, we note that the relation $xy = z^n$ implies that the divisors associated with $x$, $y$, and $z$ are related. Specifically, $[x] + [y] = n[z]$ in $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$.

        "raw_answer": "To solve the problem, we need to address each part systematically.\n\n### Part 1: Prove that $A$ is a normal domain and that the singular locus of $X$ consists of exactly one point.\n\n**Normality of $A$:**\n\nThe ring $A = k[x,y,z]/(xy - z^n)$ is a domain because $k[x,y,z]$ is a domain and the ideal $(xy - z^n)$ is prime (since $xy - z^n$ is irreducible in $k[x,y,z]$ when $\\operatorname{char}(k) \\nmid n$). \n\nTo show that $A$ is normal, we need to show that it is integrally closed in its field of fractions. The field of fractions of $A$ is $k(x,y,z)/(xy - z^n)$, which is isomorphic to $k(x,y)$ since $z^n = xy$ implies $z = (xy)^{1/n}$ in the field of fractions. \n\nThe ring $A$ is a hypersurface singularity, and it is known that hypersurfaces defined by a single polynomial in three variables are normal if the polynomial is irreducible and the field is algebraically closed. Since $xy - z^n$ is irreducible and $k$ is algebraically closed, $A$ is normal.\n\n**Singular Locus of $X$:**\n\nThe singular locus of a hypersurface $V(f)$ in $\\mathbb{A}^3$ is given by the points where the gradient $\\nabla f = (f_x, f_y, f_z)$ vanishes. Here, $f = xy - z^n$, so:\n\n- $f_x = y$,\n- $f_y = x$,\n- $f_z = -nz^{n-1}$.\n\nThe singular locus is where $y = 0$, $x = 0$, and $z = 0$. The only point satisfying these conditions is the origin $(0,0,0)$. Thus, the singular locus of $X$ consists of exactly one point, the origin.\n\n### Part 2: Compute $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$ explicitly (as an abstract abelian group).\n\nSince $A$ is a normal domain, $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$ is the divisor class group of $A$. For a hypersurface singularity of the form $xy = z^n$, it is known that $\\mathrm{Cl}(A) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$. This is because the relation $xy = z^n$ imposes a cyclic structure on the divisor class group, with the generator being the class of a divisor associated with one of the variables.\n\n### Part 3: Determine the order of $[D]\\in \\mathrm{Cl}(A)$ and show that $[D]$ generates $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$.\n\nThe divisor $D$ is defined by the height-$1$ prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p} = (x,z)$. The order of $[D]$ in $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$ is $n$, as $\\mathrm{Cl}(A) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ and $[D]$ corresponds to the generator of this cyclic group.\n\nTo show that $[D]$ generates $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$, we note that the relation $xy = z^n$ implies that the divisors associated with $x$, $y$, and $z$ are related. Specifically, $[x] + [y] = n[z]$ in $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$. The divisor $D$ associated with $(x,z)$ corresponds to $[x]$, and since $[x]$ generates the relation, it must generate the entire class group $\\mathrm{Cl}(A) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n1. $A$ is a normal domain, and the singular locus of $X$ consists of exactly one point, the origin.\n2. $\\mathrm{Cl}(A) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$.\n3.

Therefore, $\\{1, x, y, w\\}$ spans $A$.\n\n**Step 2: Show linear independence.**\n\nSuppose $a + bx + cy + dw = 0$ for some $a, b, c, d \\in k$. Evaluating this at the basis elements, we have:\n\n- The constant term gives $a = 0$.\n- The coefficient of $x$ gives $b = 0$.\n- The coefficient of $y$ gives $c = 0$.\n- The coefficient of $w$ gives $d = 0$.\n\nThus, $\\{1, x, y, w\\}$ is linearly independent, and hence a basis for $A$. Therefore, $A$ is 4-dimensional over $k$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the products among the basis elements.**\n\n- $x^2 = 0$, $y^2 = 0$ by definition.\n- $xy = w$ by definition.\n- $yx = -xy = -w$ by the relation $xy + yx = 0$.\n- $xw = x(xy) = 0$ since $x^2 = 0$.\n- $yw = y(xy) = 0$ since $y^2 = 0$.\n- $wx = (xy)x = 0$ since $x^2 = 0$.\n- $wy = (xy)y = 0$ since $y^2 = 0$.\n- $w^2 = (xy)(xy) = x(yx)y = x(-xy)y = -x(xy)y = 0$ since $x^2 = 0$.\n\n### Part 2: Determine the Jacobson radical $J(A)$ and its powers $J(A)^2, J(A)^3$. Deduce that $A$ is a local algebra. Classify all two-sided ideals of $A$.\n\n**Step 1: Determine $J(A)$.**\n\nThe Jacobson radical $J(A)$ is the intersection of all maximal left ideals of $A$. Since $A$ is finite-dimensional over a field, $J(A)$ is the set of all elements that act nilpotently on every simple $A$-module.\n\nFrom the relations, $x, y, w$ are nilpotent elements. Therefore, $J(A)$ contains the ideal generated by $x, y, w$. Since $A$ is 4-dimensional and $J(A)$ is a nilpotent ideal, $J(A) = \\langle x, y, w \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: Compute $J(A)^2$ and $J(A)^3$.**\n\n- $J(A)^2 = \\langle x, y, w \\rangle^2 = \\langle xy, yx, xw, yw, wx, wy, w^2 \\rangle = \\langle w \\rangle$.\n- $J(A)^3 = \\langle w \\rangle^2 = \\langle w^2 \\rangle = \\langle 0 \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 3: Show $A$ is a local algebra.**\n\nAn algebra is local if it has a unique maximal left ideal. Since $J(A)$ is the unique maximal ideal (as $J(A)^2 = \\langle w \\rangle$ and $J(A)^3 = 0$), $A$ is local.\n\n**Step 4: Classify all two-sided ideals of $A$.**\n\nThe two-sided ideals of $A$ are $\\{0\\}$, $\\langle w \\rangle$, $\\langle x, y, w \\rangle = J(A)$, and $A$ itself. These are all the possible ideals since $A$ is 4-dimensional and local.\n\n### Part 3: Compute the center $Z(A)$.\n\nThe center $Z(A)$ consists of elements that commute with all elements of $A$. \n\n- Any element $z \\in Z(A)$ can be written as $z = a + bx + cy + dw$.\n- For $z$ to commute with $x$, $y$, and $w$, we must have:\n  - $zx = xz$, $zy = yz$, $zw = wz$.\n\nChecking these conditions:\n\n- $zx = (a + bx + cy + dw)x = bx$ must equal $xz = x(a + bx + cy + dw) = ax + dwx = ax$.\n  - This implies $b = 0$ and $d = 0$.\n- $zy = (a + cy)y = cy$ must equal $yz = y(a + cy) = ay$.\n  - This implies $c = 0$.\n\nThus, $z = a \\in k$.

This is possible if $a, b, c, d$ are such that the determinant $ad - bc \\neq 0$.\n\n**Step 3: Describe the automorphism group.**\n\nThe automorphisms are determined by the choice of $a, b, c, d, \\alpha, \\beta$ such that $\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathrm{GL}_2(k)$, and $\\alpha, \\beta \\in k$ are arbitrary.\n\nThe map $\\varphi(x) = ax + by + \\alpha w$, $\\varphi(y) = cx + dy + \\beta w$ gives a homomorphism from $\\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A)$ to $\\mathrm{GL}_2(k)$, with kernel consisting of maps of the form $\\varphi(x) = x + \\alpha w$, $\\varphi(y) = y + \\beta w$, which is isomorphic to $k^2$.\n\nThus, we have a split short exact sequence:\n$$\n1 \\to k^2 \\to \\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A) \\to \\mathrm{GL}_2(k) \\to 1.\n$$\n\nThis completes the description of the automorphism group.",

Therefore, $\\{1, x, y, w\\}$ spans $A$.\n\n**Step 2: Show linear independence.**\n\nSuppose $a + bx + cy + dw = 0$ for some $a, b, c, d \\in k$. Evaluating this at the basis elements, we have:\n\n- The constant term gives $a = 0$.\n- The coefficient of $x$ gives $b = 0$.\n- The coefficient of $y$ gives $c = 0$.\n- The coefficient of $w$ gives $d = 0$.\n\nThus, $\\{1, x, y, w\\}$ is linearly independent, and hence a basis for $A$. Therefore, $A$ is 4-dimensional over $k$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the products among the basis elements.**\n\n- $x^2 = 0$, $y^2 = 0$ by definition.\n- $xy = w$ by definition.\n- $yx = -xy = -w$ by the relation $xy + yx = 0$.\n- $xw = x(xy) = 0$ since $x^2 = 0$.\n- $yw = y(xy) = 0$ since $y^2 = 0$.\n- $wx = (xy)x = 0$ since $x^2 = 0$.\n- $wy = (xy)y = 0$ since $y^2 = 0$.\n- $w^2 = (xy)(xy) = x(yx)y = x(-xy)y = -x(xy)y = 0$ since $x^2 = 0$.\n\n### Part 2: Determine the Jacobson radical $J(A)$ and its powers $J(A)^2, J(A)^3$. Deduce that $A$ is a local algebra. Classify all two-sided ideals of $A$.\n\n**Step 1: Determine $J(A)$.**\n\nThe Jacobson radical $J(A)$ is the intersection of all maximal left ideals of $A$. Since $A$ is finite-dimensional over a field, $J(A)$ is the set of all elements that act nilpotently on every simple $A$-module.\n\nFrom the relations, $x, y, w$ are nilpotent elements. Therefore, $J(A)$ contains the ideal generated by $x, y, w$. Since $A$ is 4-dimensional and $J(A)$ is a nilpotent ideal, $J(A) = \\langle x, y, w \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: Compute $J(A)^2$ and $J(A)^3$.**\n\n- $J(A)^2 = \\langle x, y, w \\rangle^2 = \\langle xy, yx, xw, yw, wx, wy, w^2 \\rangle = \\langle w \\rangle$.\n- $J(A)^3 = \\langle w \\rangle^2 = \\langle w^2 \\rangle = \\langle 0 \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 3: Show $A$ is a local algebra.**\n\nAn algebra is local if it has a unique maximal left ideal. Since $J(A)$ is the unique maximal ideal (as $J(A)^2 = \\langle w \\rangle$ and $J(A)^3 = 0$), $A$ is local.\n\n**Step 4: Classify all two-sided ideals of $A$.**\n\nThe two-sided ideals of $A$ are $\\{0\\}$, $\\langle w \\rangle$, $\\langle x, y, w \\rangle = J(A)$, and $A$ itself. These are all the possible ideals since $A$ is 4-dimensional and local.\n\n### Part 3: Compute the center $Z(A)$.\n\nThe center $Z(A)$ consists of elements that commute with all elements of $A$. \n\n- Any element $z \\in Z(A)$ can be written as $z = a + bx + cy + dw$.\n- For $z$ to commute with $x$, $y$, and $w$, we must have:\n  - $zx = xz$, $zy = yz$, $zw = wz$.\n\nChecking these conditions:\n\n- $zx = (a + bx + cy + dw)x = bx$ must equal $xz = x(a + bx + cy + dw) = ax + dwx = ax$.\n  - This implies $b = 0$ and $d = 0$.\n- $zy = (a + cy)y = cy$ must equal $yz = y(a + cy) = ay$.\n  - This implies $c = 0$.\n\nThus, $z = a \\in k$.

This is possible if $a, b, c, d$ are such that the determinant $ad - bc \\neq 0$.\n\n**Step 3: Describe the automorphism group.**\n\nThe automorphisms are determined by the choice of $a, b, c, d, \\alpha, \\beta$ such that $\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathrm{GL}_2(k)$, and $\\alpha, \\beta \\in k$ are arbitrary.\n\nThe map $\\varphi(x) = ax + by + \\alpha w$, $\\varphi(y) = cx + dy + \\beta w$ gives a homomorphism from $\\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A)$ to $\\mathrm{GL}_2(k)$, with kernel consisting of maps of the form $\\varphi(x) = x + \\alpha w$, $\\varphi(y) = y + \\beta w$, which is isomorphic to $k^2$.\n\nThus, we have a split short exact sequence:\n$$\n1 \\to k^2 \\to \\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A) \\to \\mathrm{GL}_2(k) \\to 1.\n$$\n\nThis completes the description of the automorphism group.",

        "raw_answer": "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the algebra $A = k\\langle x, y \\rangle / (x^2, y^2, xy + yx)$, where $k$ is a field with $\\operatorname{char}(k) \\neq 2$. We denote by $x, y \\in A$ the residue classes of the free generators, and set $w = xy \\in A$.\n\n### Part 1: Show that $A$ is 4-dimensional over $k$ with basis $\\{1, x, y, w\\}$ and determine the products among these basis elements.\n\n**Step 1: Determine a basis for $A$.**\n\nThe relations $x^2 = 0$, $y^2 = 0$, and $xy + yx = 0$ imply that any element of $A$ can be expressed as a $k$-linear combination of monomials of the form $1$, $x$, $y$, and $xy$. \n\n- $x^2 = 0$ implies no monomial of degree 2 or higher in $x$ is nonzero.\n- $y^2 = 0$ implies no monomial of degree 2 or higher in $y$ is nonzero.\n- $xy + yx = 0$ implies $yx = -xy = -w$.\n\nThus, any product of $x$ and $y$ can be reduced to a linear combination of $1$, $x$, $y$, and $w = xy$. Therefore, $\\{1, x, y, w\\}$ spans $A$.\n\n**Step 2: Show linear independence.**\n\nSuppose $a + bx + cy + dw = 0$ for some $a, b, c, d \\in k$. Evaluating this at the basis elements, we have:\n\n- The constant term gives $a = 0$.\n- The coefficient of $x$ gives $b = 0$.\n- The coefficient of $y$ gives $c = 0$.\n- The coefficient of $w$ gives $d = 0$.\n\nThus, $\\{1, x, y, w\\}$ is linearly independent, and hence a basis for $A$. Therefore, $A$ is 4-dimensional over $k$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the products among the basis elements.**\n\n- $x^2 = 0$, $y^2 = 0$ by definition.\n- $xy = w$ by definition.\n- $yx = -xy = -w$ by the relation $xy + yx = 0$.\n- $xw = x(xy) = 0$ since $x^2 = 0$.\n- $yw = y(xy) = 0$ since $y^2 = 0$.\n- $wx = (xy)x = 0$ since $x^2 = 0$.\n- $wy = (xy)y = 0$ since $y^2 = 0$.\n- $w^2 = (xy)(xy) = x(yx)y = x(-xy)y = -x(xy)y = 0$ since $x^2 = 0$.\n\n### Part 2: Determine the Jacobson radical $J(A)$ and its powers $J(A)^2, J(A)^3$. Deduce that $A$ is a local algebra. Classify all two-sided ideals of $A$.\n\n**Step 1: Determine $J(A)$.**\n\nThe Jacobson radical $J(A)$ is the intersection of all maximal left ideals of $A$. Since $A$ is finite-dimensional over a field, $J(A)$ is the set of all elements that act nilpotently on every simple $A$-module.\n\nFrom the relations, $x, y, w$ are nilpotent elements. Therefore, $J(A)$ contains the ideal generated by $x, y, w$. Since $A$ is 4-dimensional and $J(A)$ is a nilpotent ideal, $J(A) = \\langle x, y, w \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: Compute $J(A)^2$ and $J(A)^3$.**\n\n- $J(A)^2 = \\langle x, y, w \\rangle^2 = \\langle xy, yx, xw, yw, wx, wy, w^2 \\rangle = \\langle w \\rangle$.\n- $J(A)^3 = \\langle w \\rangle^2 = \\langle w^2 \\rangle = \\langle 0 \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 3: Show $A$ is a local algebra.**\n\nAn algebra is local if it has a unique maximal left ideal. Since $J(A)$ is the unique maximal ideal (as $J(A)^2 = \\langle w \\rangle$ and $J(A)^3 = 0$), $A$ is local.\n\n**Step 4: Classify all two-sided ideals of $A$.**\n\nThe two-sided ideals of $A$ are $\\{0\\}$, $\\langle w \\rangle$, $\\langle x, y, w \\rangle = J(A)$, and $A$ itself. These are all the possible ideals since $A$ is 4-dimensional and local.\n\n### Part 3: Compute the center $Z(A)$.\n\nThe center $Z(A)$ consists of elements that commute with all elements of $A$. \n\n- Any element $z \\in Z(A)$ can be written as $z = a + bx + cy + dw$.\n- For $z$ to commute with $x$, $y$, and $w$, we must have:\n  - $zx = xz$, $zy = yz$, $zw = wz$.\n\nChecking these conditions:\n\n- $zx = (a + bx + cy + dw)x = bx$ must equal $xz = x(a + bx + cy + dw) = ax + dwx = ax$.\n  - This implies $b = 0$ and $d = 0$.\n- $zy = (a + cy)y = cy$ must equal $yz = y(a + cy) = ay$.\n  - This implies $c = 0$.\n\nThus, $z = a \\in k$. Therefore, $Z(A) = k$.\n\n### Part 4: Describe $\\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A)$.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the form of automorphisms.**\n\nLet $\\varphi \\in \\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A)$. Then $\\varphi(x)$ and $\\varphi(y)$ must satisfy the same relations as $x$ and $y$:\n\n- $\\varphi(x)^2 = 0$, $\\varphi(y)^2 = 0$, $\\varphi(x)\\varphi(y) + \\varphi(y)\\varphi(x) = 0$.\n\nAssume $\\varphi(x) = ax + by + \\alpha w$ and $\\varphi(y) = cx + dy + \\beta w$ for some $a, b, c, d, \\alpha, \\beta \\in k$.\n\n- $\\varphi(x)^2 = (ax + by + \\alpha w)^2 = 0$ implies $a^2 = 0$, $b^2 = 0$, and $ab = 0$.\n- $\\varphi(y)^2 = (cx + dy + \\beta w)^2 = 0$ implies $c^2 = 0$, $d^2 = 0$, and $cd = 0$.\n- $\\varphi(x)\\varphi(y) + \\varphi(y)\\varphi(x) = 0$ implies $ad + bc = 0$.\n\nSince $a, b, c, d$ must satisfy these conditions and $a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = d^2 = 0$, we have $a, b, c, d \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the matrix condition.**\n\nThe condition $ad + bc = 0$ implies that $\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathrm{GL}_2(k)$, meaning it is invertible. This is possible if $a, b, c, d$ are such that the determinant $ad - bc \\neq 0$.\n\n**Step 3: Describe the automorphism group.**\n\nThe automorphisms are determined by the choice of $a, b, c, d, \\alpha, \\beta$ such that $\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathrm{GL}_2(k)$, and $\\alpha, \\beta \\in k$ are arbitrary.\n\nThe map $\\varphi(x) = ax + by + \\alpha w$, $\\varphi(y) = cx + dy + \\beta w$ gives a homomorphism from $\\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A)$ to $\\mathrm{GL}_2(k)$, with kernel consisting of maps of the form $\\varphi(x) = x + \\alpha w$, $\\varphi(y) = y + \\beta w$, which is isomorphic to $k^2$.\n\nThus, we have a split short exact sequence:\n$$\n1 \\to k^2 \\to \\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A) \\to \\mathrm{GL}_2(k) \\to 1.\n$$\n\nThis completes the description of the automorphism group.",

Define $D_C(X) = CX - XC$. We check the derivation property:\n\n$$\nD_C(X \\circ Y) = C(X \\circ Y) - (X \\circ Y)C = \\frac{1}{2}(C(XY + YX) - (XY + YX)C).\n$$\n\nOn the other hand:\n\n$$\nD_C(X) \\circ Y + X \\circ D_C(Y) = (CX - XC) \\circ Y + X \\circ (CY - YC).\n$$\n\nCompute:\n\n1. **First term:**\n\n   $$\n   (CX - XC) \\circ Y = \\frac{1}{2}((CX - XC)Y + Y(CX - XC)) = \\frac{1}{2}(CXY - XCY + YCX - YXC).\n   $$\n\n2. **Second term:**\n\n   $$\n   X \\circ (CY - YC) = \\frac{1}{2}(X(CY - YC) + (CY - YC)X) = \\frac{1}{2}(XCY - XYC + CYX - YCX).\n   $$\n\nAdding these, we get:\n\n$$\nD_C(X) \\circ Y + X \\circ D_C(Y) = \\frac{1}{2}(CXY - XCY + YCX - YXC + XCY - XYC + CYX - YCX).\n$$\n\nSimplifying, this becomes:\n\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{2}(CXY + CYX - YXC - XYC) = \\frac{1}{2}(C(XY + YX) - (XY + YX)C).\n$$\n\nThis matches $D_C(X \\circ Y)$, so $D_C$ is indeed a derivation.\n\n**Step 2: Show every derivation is of this form.**\n\nSuppose $D$ is a derivation.

We check the derivation property:\n\n$$\nD_C(X \\circ Y) = C(X \\circ Y) - (X \\circ Y)C = \\frac{1}{2}(C(XY + YX) - (XY + YX)C).\n$$\n\nOn the other hand:\n\n$$\nD_C(X) \\circ Y + X \\circ D_C(Y) = (CX - XC) \\circ Y + X \\circ (CY - YC).\n$$\n\nCompute:\n\n1. **First term:**\n\n   $$\n   (CX - XC) \\circ Y = \\frac{1}{2}((CX - XC)Y + Y(CX - XC)) = \\frac{1}{2}(CXY - XCY + YCX - YXC).\n   $$\n\n2. **Second term:**\n\n   $$\n   X \\circ (CY - YC) = \\frac{1}{2}(X(CY - YC) + (CY - YC)X) = \\frac{1}{2}(XCY - XYC + CYX - YCX).\n   $$\n\nAdding these, we get:\n\n$$\nD_C(X) \\circ Y + X \\circ D_C(Y) = \\frac{1}{2}(CXY - XCY + YCX - YXC + XCY - XYC + CYX - YCX).\n$$\n\nSimplifying, this becomes:\n\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{2}(CXY + CYX - YXC - XYC) = \\frac{1}{2}(C(XY + YX) - (XY + YX)C).\n$$\n\nThis matches $D_C(X \\circ Y)$, so $D_C$ is indeed a derivation.\n\n**Step 2: Show every derivation is of this form.**\n\nSuppose $D$ is a derivation. Consider $D(I)$, where $I$ is the identity matrix. For any $X \\in J$, we have:\n\n$$\nD(X) = D(X \\circ I) = D(X) \\circ I + X \\circ D(I) = D(X) + X \\circ D(I).\n$$\n\nThus, $X \\circ D(I) = 0$ for all $X \\in J$. This implies $D(I)$ is a scalar multiple of $I$, say $D(I) = \\lambda I$. However, for $D$ to be a derivation, $D(I) = 0$ because $D(I) \\circ I = 0$. Therefore, $D(I) = 0$.\n\nNow, define $C = -D(I)$. Then for any $X \\in J$, $D(X) = CX - XC$ for some $C \\in M_2(F)$. Since $D(I) = 0$, $C$ must be traceless.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nEvery derivation $D$ of the Jordan algebra $J$ is of the form $D_C(X) = CX - XC$ for a unique traceless matrix $C \\in M_2(F)$. The set of all such derivations is isomorphic to $\\mathfrak{sl}_2(F)$, the Lie algebra of traceless $2 \\times 2$ matrices over $F$.\n\nThus, $\\mathrm{Der}(J) \\cong \\mathfrak{sl}_2(F)$.",

If $f(x) = c$ for all $x$, then $f'(x) = 0$ for all $x$. Substituting into the functional equation:\n\n$$\nc = c \\cdot c + 0 \\cdot 0 = c^2.\n$$\n\nThis implies $c = 0$ or $c = 1$.

We have $f(0) = 1$ and $f'(0) = 0$. Consider the Taylor expansion of $f(x)$ around $x = 0$:\n\n$$\nf(x) = f(0) + f'(0)x + \\frac{f''(0)}{2}x^2 + \\frac{f'''(0)}{6}x^3 + \\cdots.\n$$\n\nGiven $f(0) = 1$ and $f'(0) = 0$, the expansion becomes:\n\n$$\nf(x) = 1 + \\frac{f''(0)}{2}x^2 + \\frac{f'''(0)}{6}x^3 + \\cdots.\n$$\n\nSubstitute this into the functional equation and compare coefficients.

This is a strong condition that suggests $f$ behaves like a characteristic function of a subgroup of $G$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Conditions\n\nGiven that $f * f = f$, we have:\n$$\n(f * f)(x) = \\int_G f(y) f(x-y) \\, dm(y) = f(x) \\quad \\text{for $m$-a.e. } x \\in G.\n$$\n\n### Step 3: Considering the Support of $f$\n\nSince $f(x) \\ge 0$ and $\\int_G f \\, dm = 1$, $f$ can be thought of as a probability density function on $G$. The condition $f * f = f$ suggests that $f$ is concentrated on a subgroup $H \\subseteq G$ such that $f$ is the characteristic function of $H$.\n\n### Step 4: Characteristic Function of a Subgroup\n\nSuppose $f = \\chi_H$, the characteristic function of a closed subgroup $H \\subseteq G$. Then:\n- $f(x) = 1$ if $x \\in H$ and $f(x) = 0$ if $x \\notin H$.\n- The convolution $f * f$ becomes:\n  $$\n  (f * f)(x) = \\int_G \\chi_H(y) \\chi_H(x-y) \\, dm(y) = \\int_H \\chi_H(x-y) \\, dm(y).\n  $$\n  Since $H$ is a subgroup, $x-y \\in H$ if and only if $x \\in H$. Thus, $\\chi_H(x-y) = 1$ for $x \\in H$ and $0$ otherwise.\n\n- Therefore, $(f * f)(x) = 1$ if $x \\in H$ and $0$ otherwise, which is exactly $f(x)$.\n\n### Step 5: Normalization Condition\n\nThe condition $\\int_G f \\, dm = 1$ implies that $m(H) = 1$. Since $m$ is a probability measure, this means $H = G$. Therefore, $f = \\chi_G = 1$ $m$-a.e.\n\n### Step 6: Connectedness of $G$\n\nIf $G$ is connected, the only closed subgroup of $G$ with full measure is $G$ itself. Thus, $f = 1$ $m$-a.e. is the only possibility.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only function $f \\in L^1(G)$ satisfying all the given conditions is the constant function $f = 1$ $m$-a.e. This is true for any compact abelian Hausdorff topological group $G$.

The condition $f * f = f$ suggests that $f$ is concentrated on a subgroup $H \\subseteq G$ such that $f$ is the characteristic function of $H$.\n\n### Step 4: Characteristic Function of a Subgroup\n\nSuppose $f = \\chi_H$, the characteristic function of a closed subgroup $H \\subseteq G$. Then:\n- $f(x) = 1$ if $x \\in H$ and $f(x) = 0$ if $x \\notin H$.\n- The convolution $f * f$ becomes:\n  $$\n  (f * f)(x) = \\int_G \\chi_H(y) \\chi_H(x-y) \\, dm(y) = \\int_H \\chi_H(x-y) \\, dm(y).\n  $$\n  Since $H$ is a subgroup, $x-y \\in H$ if and only if $x \\in H$. Thus, $\\chi_H(x-y) = 1$ for $x \\in H$ and $0$ otherwise.\n\n- Therefore, $(f * f)(x) = 1$ if $x \\in H$ and $0$ otherwise, which is exactly $f(x)$.\n\n### Step 5: Normalization Condition\n\nThe condition $\\int_G f \\, dm = 1$ implies that $m(H) = 1$. Since $m$ is a probability measure, this means $H = G$. Therefore, $f = \\chi_G = 1$ $m$-a.e.\n\n### Step 6: Connectedness of $G$\n\nIf $G$ is connected, the only closed subgroup of $G$ with full measure is $G$ itself. Thus, $f = 1$ $m$-a.e. is the only possibility.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only function $f \\in L^1(G)$ satisfying all the given conditions is the constant function $f = 1$ $m$-a.e. This is true for any compact abelian Hausdorff topological group $G$. If $G$ is connected, this conclusion is reinforced as there are no proper closed subgroups with full measure.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe function $f$ is $f = 1$ $m$-a.e. on $G$. If $G$ is connected, then necessarily $f = 1$ $m$-a.e.",

The Euler-Lagrange equation for this functional is given by\n\n$$\n\\frac{d^2}{dx^2} \\left( \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y''} \\right) = 0.\n$$\n\nSince $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y''} = 2y''$, we have\n\n$$\n\\frac{d^2}{dx^2} (2y'') = 0 \\implies y^{(4)} = 0.\n$$\n\n### Step 2: Solve the Differential Equation\n\nThe differential equation $y^{(4)} = 0$ implies that $y(x)$ is a cubic polynomial:\n\n$$\ny(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d.\n$$\n\n### Step 3: Apply Boundary Conditions\n\nWe apply the boundary conditions to determine the coefficients $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$.\n\n1. $y(0) = 0 \\implies d = 0$.\n2. $y(1) = 0 \\implies a + b + c = 0$.\n3. $y'(0) = p \\implies c = p$.\n4. $y'(1) = q \\implies 3a + 2b + c = q$.\n\nSubstituting $c = p$ and $d = 0$ into the equations, we have:\n\n- From $y(1) = 0$: $a + b + p = 0 \\implies a + b = -p$.\n- From $y'(1) = q$: $3a + 2b + p = q$.\n\nWe now solve these two equations:\n\n1. $a + b = -p$.\n2. $3a + 2b = q - p$.\n\nFrom the first equation, $b = -p - a$. Substitute into the second equation:\n\n$$\n3a + 2(-p - a) = q - p \\implies 3a - 2a - 2p = q - p \\implies a - 2p = q - p \\implies a = q + p.\n$$\n\nSubstitute $a = q + p$ into $b = -p - a$:\n\n$$\nb = -p - (q + p) = -q - 2p.\n$$\n\nThus, the coefficients are $a = q + p$, $b = -q - 2p$, $c = p$, and $d = 0$. Therefore, the minimizer is:\n\n$$\ny^*(x) = (q + p)x^3 + (-q - 2p)x^2 + px.\n$$\n\n### Step 4: Compute the Minimum Value\n\nTo find the minimum value of $J[y]$, we compute $J[y^*]$:\n\nFirst, compute $y''(x)$:\n\n$$\ny''(x) = 6(q + p)x + 2(-q - 2p) = 6(q + p)x - 2(q + 2p).\n$$\n\nThen, \n\n$$\n(y''(x))^2 = (6(q + p)x - 2(q + 2p))^2.\n$$\n\nNow, compute the integral:\n\n$$\nJ[y^*] = \\int_0^1 (6(q + p)x - 2(q + 2p))^2 \\, dx.\n$$\n\nExpanding the square:\n\n$$\n(6(q + p)x - 2(q + 2p))^2 = 36(q + p)^2 x^2 - 24(q + p)(q + 2p)x + 4(q + 2p)^2.\n$$\n\nIntegrate term by term:\n\n1. $\\int_0^1 36(q + p)^2 x^2 \\, dx = 36(q + p)^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = 12(q + p)^2$.\n2. $\\int_0^1 -24(q + p)(q + 2p)x \\, dx = -24(q + p)(q + 2p) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = -12(q + p)(q + 2p)$.\n3. $\\int_0^1 4(q + 2p)^2 \\, dx = 4(q + 2p)^2$.\n\nThus,\n\n$$\nJ[y^*] = 12(q + p)^2 - 12(q + p)(q + 2p) + 4(q + 2p)^2.\n$$\n\nSimplify:\n\n$$\nJ[y^*] = 12(q^2 + 2pq + p^2) - 12(q^2 + 2pq + pq + 2p^2) + 4(q^2 + 4pq + 4p^2).\n$$\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n$$\nJ[y^*] = 12q^2 + 24pq + 12p^2 - 12q^2 - 36pq - 24p^2 + 4q^2 + 16pq + 16p^2.\n$$\n\nSimplify:\n\n$$\nJ[y^*] = (12q^2 - 12q^2 + 4q^2) + (24pq - 36pq + 16pq) + (12p^2 - 24p^2 + 16p^2).\n$$\n\n$$\nJ[y^*] = 4q^2 + 4pq + 4p^2 = 4(q^2 + pq + p^2).\n$$\n\n### Step 5: Prove Uniqueness\n\nThe Euler-Lagrange equation $y^{(4)} = 0$ implies that any minimizer must be a cubic polynomial. The boundary conditions uniquely determine the coefficients of this polynomial, as shown in the derivation. Therefore, the minimizer $y^*(x)$ is unique.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n1.

        "raw_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to minimize the functional \n\n$$\nJ[y] = \\int_0^1 \\bigl(y''(x)\\bigr)^2 \\, dx\n$$\n\nover the admissible class \n\n$$\n\\mathcal{A} = \\Bigl\\{ y \\in C^2([0,1]) : y(0) = y(1) = 0, \\; y'(0) = p, \\; y'(1) = q \\Bigr\\}.\n$$\n\n### Step 1: Find the Euler-Lagrange Equation\n\nThe functional $J[y]$ is of the form \n\n$$\nJ[y] = \\int_0^1 F(x, y, y', y'') \\, dx\n$$\n\nwhere $F(x, y, y', y'') = (y'')^2$. The Euler-Lagrange equation for this functional is given by\n\n$$\n\\frac{d^2}{dx^2} \\left( \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y''} \\right) = 0.\n$$\n\nSince $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y''} = 2y''$, we have\n\n$$\n\\frac{d^2}{dx^2} (2y'') = 0 \\implies y^{(4)} = 0.\n$$\n\n### Step 2: Solve the Differential Equation\n\nThe differential equation $y^{(4)} = 0$ implies that $y(x)$ is a cubic polynomial:\n\n$$\ny(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d.\n$$\n\n### Step 3: Apply Boundary Conditions\n\nWe apply the boundary conditions to determine the coefficients $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$.\n\n1. $y(0) = 0 \\implies d = 0$.\n2. $y(1) = 0 \\implies a + b + c = 0$.\n3. $y'(0) = p \\implies c = p$.\n4. $y'(1) = q \\implies 3a + 2b + c = q$.\n\nSubstituting $c = p$ and $d = 0$ into the equations, we have:\n\n- From $y(1) = 0$: $a + b + p = 0 \\implies a + b = -p$.\n- From $y'(1) = q$: $3a + 2b + p = q$.\n\nWe now solve these two equations:\n\n1. $a + b = -p$.\n2. $3a + 2b = q - p$.\n\nFrom the first equation, $b = -p - a$. Substitute into the second equation:\n\n$$\n3a + 2(-p - a) = q - p \\implies 3a - 2a - 2p = q - p \\implies a - 2p = q - p \\implies a = q + p.\n$$\n\nSubstitute $a = q + p$ into $b = -p - a$:\n\n$$\nb = -p - (q + p) = -q - 2p.\n$$\n\nThus, the coefficients are $a = q + p$, $b = -q - 2p$, $c = p$, and $d = 0$. Therefore, the minimizer is:\n\n$$\ny^*(x) = (q + p)x^3 + (-q - 2p)x^2 + px.\n$$\n\n### Step 4: Compute the Minimum Value\n\nTo find the minimum value of $J[y]$, we compute $J[y^*]$:\n\nFirst, compute $y''(x)$:\n\n$$\ny''(x) = 6(q + p)x + 2(-q - 2p) = 6(q + p)x - 2(q + 2p).\n$$\n\nThen, \n\n$$\n(y''(x))^2 = (6(q + p)x - 2(q + 2p))^2.\n$$\n\nNow, compute the integral:\n\n$$\nJ[y^*] = \\int_0^1 (6(q + p)x - 2(q + 2p))^2 \\, dx.\n$$\n\nExpanding the square:\n\n$$\n(6(q + p)x - 2(q + 2p))^2 = 36(q + p)^2 x^2 - 24(q + p)(q + 2p)x + 4(q + 2p)^2.\n$$\n\nIntegrate term by term:\n\n1. $\\int_0^1 36(q + p)^2 x^2 \\, dx = 36(q + p)^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = 12(q + p)^2$.\n2. $\\int_0^1 -24(q + p)(q + 2p)x \\, dx = -24(q + p)(q + 2p) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = -12(q + p)(q + 2p)$.\n3. $\\int_0^1 4(q + 2p)^2 \\, dx = 4(q + 2p)^2$.\n\nThus,\n\n$$\nJ[y^*] = 12(q + p)^2 - 12(q + p)(q + 2p) + 4(q + 2p)^2.\n$$\n\nSimplify:\n\n$$\nJ[y^*] = 12(q^2 + 2pq + p^2) - 12(q^2 + 2pq + pq + 2p^2) + 4(q^2 + 4pq + 4p^2).\n$$\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n$$\nJ[y^*] = 12q^2 + 24pq + 12p^2 - 12q^2 - 36pq - 24p^2 + 4q^2 + 16pq + 16p^2.\n$$\n\nSimplify:\n\n$$\nJ[y^*] = (12q^2 - 12q^2 + 4q^2) + (24pq - 36pq + 16pq) + (12p^2 - 24p^2 + 16p^2).\n$$\n\n$$\nJ[y^*] = 4q^2 + 4pq + 4p^2 = 4(q^2 + pq + p^2).\n$$\n\n### Step 5: Prove Uniqueness\n\nThe Euler-Lagrange equation $y^{(4)} = 0$ implies that any minimizer must be a cubic polynomial. The boundary conditions uniquely determine the coefficients of this polynomial, as shown in the derivation. Therefore, the minimizer $y^*(x)$ is unique.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n1. The unique minimizer is $y^*(x) = (q + p)x^3 + (-q - 2p)x^2 + px$.\n2. The minimum value is $\\min_{y \\in \\mathcal{A}} J[y] = 4(q^2 + pq + p^2)$.\n3.

We have:\n\n- $\\pi_1(A) \\cong \\pi_1(T^2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}$, generated by $a$ and $b$, where $a$ corresponds to $S^1_x$ and $b$ corresponds to $S^1_y$ in $A$.\n- $\\pi_1(B) \\cong \\pi_1(T^2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}$, generated by $c$ and $d$, where $c$ corresponds to $S^1_x$ and $d$ corresponds to $S^1_y$ in $B$.\n- $\\pi_1(C) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, generated by $e$, where $e$ corresponds to $S^1_x$.\n\nThe inclusion maps induce the following homomorphisms on fundamental groups:\n- $i_*: \\pi_1(C) \\to \\pi_1(A)$, where $i_*(e) = a$.\n- $j_*: \\pi_1(C) \\to \\pi_1(B)$, where $j_*(e) = c$.\n\nBy the Seifert-van Kampen theorem, the fundamental group $\\pi_1(X)$ is the pushout of the diagram:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ccc}\n\\pi_1(C) & \\xrightarrow{i_*} & \\pi_1(A) \\\\\n\\downarrow{j_*} & & \\\\\n\\pi_1(B) & &\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nThis gives:\n\n$$\n\\pi_1(X) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}) * (\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}) / \\langle a = c \\rangle.\n$$\n\nThus, $\\pi_1(X)$ is isomorphic to the group:\n\n$$\n\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\langle a, b, d \\mid [a, b] = 1, [a, d] = 1 \\rangle.\n$$\n\nThis is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{F}_2$, where $\\mathbb{F}_2$ is the free group on two generators. The generator $a$ commutes with both $b$ and $d$, reflecting the fact that $a$ corresponds to the circle $S^1_x$ along which the tori are glued.\n\n### 2) Compute the integral cohomology ring $H^*(X;\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nTo compute the cohomology ring, we use the Mayer-Vietoris sequence for cohomology.
