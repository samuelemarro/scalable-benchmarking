The theory $T$ includes axioms that define a simple undirected graph and an extension axiom for realizing adjacency patterns.\n\n### Task 1: Prove that $T$ is consistent\n\nTo show that $T$ is consistent, we need to demonstrate that every finite subset of $T$ has a model. We will then use the Compactness Theorem to conclude that $T$ itself has a model.\n\n1. **Finite Subset of $T$:**\n   - Consider a finite subset $T_0 \\subseteq T$. This subset will include a finite number of instances of the extension axiom, each for specific values of $m$ and $n$.\n   - Each instance of the extension axiom asserts that for any disjoint sets $U$ and $V$ of specific sizes, there exists a vertex $z$ realizing the adjacency pattern $(U, V)$.\n\n2. **Constructing a Model for $T_0$:**\n   - We can construct a model for $T_0$ by considering a graph $G$ with a sufficiently large set of vertices.

This can be achieved by ensuring that for each finite pair $(U, V)$, there is a vertex $z$ that satisfies the required adjacency pattern.\n\n3. **Verification:**\n   - Since $G$ is infinite, we can always find a vertex $z$ not in any finite subset $U \\cup V$.

Use the extension property in $G_2$ to find $b_{n+1} \\in G_2 \\setminus B_n$ such that $b_{n+1}$ realizes the same adjacency pattern with respect to $B_n$ as $a_{n+1}$ does with respect to $A_n$.

We consider two colorings the same if one can be obtained from the other by a rotation or reflection, which corresponds to the symmetries of a regular decagon.\n\n### Step 1: Count the Total Number of Admissible Colorings\n\nFirst, we count the total number of ways to arrange 4 black beads and 6 white beads such that no two black beads are adjacent. \n\nConsider placing the 6 white beads first. This creates 6 gaps between them (including the gap after the last white bead and before the first white bead, due to the circular arrangement). We need to place the 4 black beads in these 6 gaps, ensuring no two black beads are adjacent.\n\nThe problem of placing 4 black beads in 6 gaps with no two adjacent is equivalent to choosing 4 gaps out of the 6 to place a black bead. This is a combinatorial selection problem, and the number of ways to do this is given by the binomial coefficient:\n\n$$\n\\binom{6}{4} = 15\n$$\n\nThus, there are 15 admissible colorings without considering symmetry.\n\n### Step 2: Account for Dihedral Symmetry\n\nThe dihedral group $D_{10}$, which represents the symmetries of a regular decagon, has 20 elements: 10 rotations and 10 reflections. We will use Burnside's Lemma to count the number of distinct colorings under these symmetries.\n\nBurnside's Lemma states that the number of distinct colorings is the average number of colorings fixed by each group element. We will consider the effect of each type of symmetry:\n\n#### Rotations\n\n- **Rotation by 0 positions (identity):** All 15 colorings are fixed.\n- **Rotation by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 positions:** No coloring is fixed because a rotation by any of these positions would place at least one black bead adjacent to another.\n- **Rotation by 5 positions:** This rotation maps each bead to the bead directly opposite it. For a coloring to be fixed, the pattern must be symmetric across this rotation, which is impossible with 4 black beads and 6 white beads. Thus, no colorings are fixed.\n\n#### Reflections\n\nFor a reflection to fix a coloring, the coloring must be symmetric with respect to the axis of reflection. Consider the 10 axes of reflection:\n\n- **Reflections through a vertex and the midpoint of the opposite side:** There are 5 such axes. For a coloring to be fixed, the pattern must be symmetric across this axis. This is impossible with 4 black beads and 6 white beads, as it would require an even distribution of black beads on either side of the axis, which cannot be achieved without adjacent black beads.\n  \n- **Reflections through the midpoints of opposite sides:** There are 5 such axes. Similar to the above, symmetry across these axes is impossible with 4 black beads and 6 white beads.\n\nThus, no colorings are fixed by any reflection.\n\n### Step 3: Apply Burnside's Lemma\n\nUsing Burnside's Lemma, the number of distinct colorings is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{20} \\left( 15 \\times 1 + 0 \\times 9 + 0 \\times 10 \\right) = \\frac{15}{20} = \\frac{3}{4}\n$$\n\nSince the number of distinct colorings must be an integer, and we have accounted for all symmetries, it appears there was an oversight in the calculation. Let's re-evaluate:\n\nUpon re-evaluation, the correct application of Burnside's Lemma should yield:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{20} \\left( 15 \\times 1 + 0 \\times 19 \\right) = \\frac{15}{20} = \\frac{3}{4}\n$$\n\nThis suggests a miscalculation in the symmetry analysis.

For a coloring to be fixed, the pattern must be symmetric across this rotation, which is impossible with 4 black beads and 6 white beads. Thus, no colorings are fixed.\n\n#### Reflections\n\nFor a reflection to fix a coloring, the coloring must be symmetric with respect to the axis of reflection. Consider the 10 axes of reflection:\n\n- **Reflections through a vertex and the midpoint of the opposite side:** There are 5 such axes. For a coloring to be fixed, the pattern must be symmetric across this axis. This is impossible with 4 black beads and 6 white beads, as it would require an even distribution of black beads on either side of the axis, which cannot be achieved without adjacent black beads.\n  \n- **Reflections through the midpoints of opposite sides:** There are 5 such axes.

We will address each part of the question in turn.\n\n### Part 1: Prove that $A$ is a normal domain and that the singular locus of $X$ consists of exactly one point.\n\n**Normality of $A$:**\n\n1. **Domain:** The ring $A$ is a domain because $k[x,y,z]$ is a domain and the ideal $(xy - z^n)$ is prime. This follows because $xy - z^n$ is an irreducible polynomial in $k[x,y,z]$ when $\\operatorname{char}(k) \\nmid n$. Thus, $A$ is an integral domain.\n\n2. **Normality:** A ring is normal if it is integrally closed in its field of fractions. The field of fractions of $A$ is $k(x,y)$, since $z^n = xy$ in $A$, and $z$ can be expressed as $z = (xy)^{1/n}$ in the field of fractions. \n\n   To show $A$ is normal, we use the fact that $A$ is a hypersurface singularity of the form $k[x,y,z]/(xy - z^n)$, which is known to be normal if $\\operatorname{char}(k) \\nmid n$. This is a standard result in algebraic geometry, often proved using the Jacobian criterion or by showing that the singular locus is of codimension at least 2.\n\n**Singular Locus:**\n\nThe singular locus of $X$ is determined by the vanishing of the partial derivatives of the defining equation $xy - z^n = 0$. The partial derivatives are:\n\n- $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(xy - z^n) = y$,\n- $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(xy - z^n) = x$,\n- $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(xy - z^n) = -nz^{n-1}$.\n\nThe singular locus is where all these partial derivatives vanish simultaneously. This occurs at the point $(x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0)$, since $y = 0$, $x = 0$, and $z = 0$ are the only solutions. Thus, the singular locus consists of exactly one point, the origin.\n\n### Part 2: Compute $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$ explicitly (as an abstract abelian group).\n\nThe divisor class group $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$ of a normal domain $A$ is isomorphic to the group of Weil divisors modulo principal divisors. For the hypersurface $xy = z^n$, the divisor class group is known to be $\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$. This can be shown by considering the divisors associated with the coordinate axes and the relation given by the equation $xy = z^n$.\n\n### Part 3: Determine the order of $[D]\\in \\mathrm{Cl}(A)$ and show that $[D]$ generates $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$.\n\nThe divisor $D$ is defined by the height-1 prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p} = (x, z)$. The order of $[D]$ in $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$ is $n$, because $nD$ is linearly equivalent to a principal divisor. Specifically, $nD$ is linearly equivalent to the divisor of the function $x$, which is principal.\n\nTo see this, note that the relation $xy = z^n$ implies that $nD$ is equivalent to the divisor of $x$, since $x$ vanishes to order $n$ along $D$. Therefore, $[D]$ has order $n$ in $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$.\n\nSince $\\mathrm{Cl}(A) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$, and $[D]$ has order $n$, it follows that $[D]$ generates $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n1. $A$ is a normal domain, and the singular locus of $X$ consists of exactly one point, the origin.\n2. $\\mathrm{Cl}(A) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$.\n3.

We will address each part of the question in turn.\n\n### Part 1: Prove that $A$ is a normal domain and that the singular locus of $X$ consists of exactly one point.\n\n**Normality of $A$:**\n\n1. **Domain:** The ring $A$ is a domain because $k[x,y,z]$ is a domain and the ideal $(xy - z^n)$ is prime. This follows because $xy - z^n$ is an irreducible polynomial in $k[x,y,z]$ when $\\operatorname{char}(k) \\nmid n$. Thus, $A$ is an integral domain.\n\n2. **Normality:** A ring is normal if it is integrally closed in its field of fractions. The field of fractions of $A$ is $k(x,y)$, since $z^n = xy$ in $A$, and $z$ can be expressed as $z = (xy)^{1/n}$ in the field of fractions. \n\n   To show $A$ is normal, we use the fact that $A$ is a hypersurface singularity of the form $k[x,y,z]/(xy - z^n)$, which is known to be normal if $\\operatorname{char}(k) \\nmid n$. This is a standard result in algebraic geometry, often proved using the Jacobian criterion or by showing that the singular locus is of codimension at least 2.\n\n**Singular Locus:**\n\nThe singular locus of $X$ is determined by the vanishing of the partial derivatives of the defining equation $xy - z^n = 0$. The partial derivatives are:\n\n- $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(xy - z^n) = y$,\n- $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(xy - z^n) = x$,\n- $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(xy - z^n) = -nz^{n-1}$.\n\nThe singular locus is where all these partial derivatives vanish simultaneously. This occurs at the point $(x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0)$, since $y = 0$, $x = 0$, and $z = 0$ are the only solutions. Thus, the singular locus consists of exactly one point, the origin.\n\n### Part 2: Compute $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$ explicitly (as an abstract abelian group).\n\nThe divisor class group $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$ of a normal domain $A$ is isomorphic to the group of Weil divisors modulo principal divisors. For the hypersurface $xy = z^n$, the divisor class group is known to be $\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$. This can be shown by considering the divisors associated with the coordinate axes and the relation given by the equation $xy = z^n$.\n\n### Part 3: Determine the order of $[D]\\in \\mathrm{Cl}(A)$ and show that $[D]$ generates $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$.\n\nThe divisor $D$ is defined by the height-1 prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p} = (x, z)$. The order of $[D]$ in $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$ is $n$, because $nD$ is linearly equivalent to a principal divisor. Specifically, $nD$ is linearly equivalent to the divisor of the function $x$, which is principal.\n\nTo see this, note that the relation $xy = z^n$ implies that $nD$ is equivalent to the divisor of $x$, since $x$ vanishes to order $n$ along $D$. Therefore, $[D]$ has order $n$ in $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$.\n\nSince $\\mathrm{Cl}(A) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$, and $[D]$ has order $n$, it follows that $[D]$ generates $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n1. $A$ is a normal domain, and the singular locus of $X$ consists of exactly one point, the origin.\n2. $\\mathrm{Cl}(A) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$.\n3. The divisor $D$ defined by the prime ideal $(x, z)$ has order $n$ in $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$ and generates $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$.\n\nThus, $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$, with $[D]$ as a generator.",

        "answer": "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the algebra $A = k\\langle x, y \\rangle / (x^2, y^2, xy + yx)$, where $k$ is a field with $\\operatorname{char}(k) \\neq 2$. We denote by $x, y \\in A$ the residue classes of the free generators, and set $w = xy \\in A$.\n\n### Part 1: Show that $A$ is 4-dimensional over $k$ with basis $\\{1, x, y, w\\}$ and determine the products among these basis elements.\n\n**Step 1: Determine a basis for $A$.**\n\nThe relations $x^2 = 0$, $y^2 = 0$, and $xy + yx = 0$ imply that any element of $A$ can be expressed as a $k$-linear combination of monomials of the form $1$, $x$, $y$, and $xy$. \n\n- $x^2 = 0$ implies no monomial of degree 2 or higher in $x$ is nonzero.\n- $y^2 = 0$ implies no monomial of degree 2 or higher in $y$ is nonzero.\n- $xy + yx = 0$ implies $yx = -xy = -w$.\n\nThus, any product of $x$ and $y$ can be reduced to a linear combination of $1$, $x$, $y$, and $w = xy$. Therefore, $\\{1, x, y, w\\}$ spans $A$.\n\n**Step 2: Show linear independence.**\n\nSuppose $a + bx + cy + dw = 0$ for some $a, b, c, d \\in k$. Evaluating this at the basis elements, we have:\n\n- The constant term gives $a = 0$.\n- The coefficient of $x$ gives $b = 0$.\n- The coefficient of $y$ gives $c = 0$.\n- The coefficient of $w$ gives $d = 0$.\n\nThus, $\\{1, x, y, w\\}$ is linearly independent, and hence a basis for $A$. Therefore, $A$ is 4-dimensional over $k$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the products among the basis elements.**\n\n- $x^2 = 0$, $y^2 = 0$ by definition.\n- $xy = w$ by definition.\n- $yx = -xy = -w$ by the relation $xy + yx = 0$.\n- $xw = x(xy) = 0$ since $x^2 = 0$.\n- $yw = y(xy) = 0$ since $y^2 = 0$.\n- $wx = (xy)x = 0$ since $x^2 = 0$.\n- $wy = (xy)y = 0$ since $y^2 = 0$.\n- $w^2 = (xy)(xy) = x(yx)y = x(-xy)y = -x(xy)y = 0$ since $x^2 = 0$.\n\n### Part 2: Determine the Jacobson radical $J(A)$ and its powers $J(A)^2, J(A)^3$. Deduce that $A$ is a local algebra. Classify all two-sided ideals of $A$.\n\n**Step 1: Determine $J(A)$.**\n\nThe Jacobson radical $J(A)$ is the intersection of all maximal left ideals of $A$. Since $A$ is finite-dimensional over a field, $J(A)$ is the set of all elements that act nilpotently on every simple $A$-module.\n\nFrom the relations, $x, y, w$ are nilpotent elements. Therefore, $J(A)$ contains the ideal generated by $x, y, w$. Since $A$ is 4-dimensional and $J(A)$ is a nilpotent ideal, $J(A) = \\langle x, y, w \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: Compute $J(A)^2$ and $J(A)^3$.**\n\n- $J(A)^2 = \\langle x, y, w \\rangle^2 = \\langle xy, yx, xw, yw, wx, wy, w^2 \\rangle = \\langle w \\rangle$.\n- $J(A)^3 = \\langle w \\rangle^2 = \\langle w^2 \\rangle = \\langle 0 \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 3: Show $A$ is a local algebra.**\n\nAn algebra is local if it has a unique maximal left ideal. Since $J(A)$ is the unique maximal ideal (as $J(A)^2 = \\langle w \\rangle$ and $J(A)^3 = 0$), $A$ is local.\n\n**Step 4: Classify all two-sided ideals of $A$.**\n\nThe two-sided ideals of $A$ are $\\{0\\}$, $\\langle w \\rangle$, $\\langle x, y, w \\rangle = J(A)$, and $A$ itself. These are all the possible ideals since $A$ is 4-dimensional and local.\n\n### Part 3: Compute the center $Z(A)$.\n\nThe center $Z(A)$ consists of elements that commute with all elements of $A$. \n\n- Any element $z \\in Z(A)$ can be written as $z = a + bx + cy + dw$.\n- For $z$ to commute with $x$, $y$, and $w$, we must have:\n  - $zx = xz$, $zy = yz$, $zw = wz$.\n\nChecking these conditions:\n\n- $zx = (a + bx + cy + dw)x = bx$ must equal $xz = x(a + bx + cy + dw) = ax + dwx = ax$.\n  - This implies $b = 0$ and $d = 0$.\n- $zy = (a + cy)y = cy$ must equal $yz = y(a + cy) = ay$.\n  - This implies $c = 0$.\n\nThus, $z = a \\in k$. Therefore, $Z(A) = k$.\n\n### Part 4: Describe $\\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A)$.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the form of automorphisms.**\n\nLet $\\varphi \\in \\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A)$.

This is possible if $a, b, c, d$ are such that the determinant $ad - bc \\neq 0$.\n\n**Step 3: Describe the automorphism group.**\n\nThe automorphisms are determined by the choice of $a, b, c, d, \\alpha, \\beta$ such that $\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathrm{GL}_2(k)$, and $\\alpha, \\beta \\in k$ are arbitrary.\n\nThe map $\\varphi(x) = ax + by + \\alpha w$, $\\varphi(y) = cx + dy + \\beta w$ gives a homomorphism from $\\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A)$ to $\\mathrm{GL}_2(k)$, with kernel consisting of maps of the form $\\varphi(x) = x + \\alpha w$, $\\varphi(y) = y + \\beta w$, which is isomorphic to $k^2$.\n\nThus, we have a split short exact sequence:\n$$\n1 \\to k^2 \\to \\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A) \\to \\mathrm{GL}_2(k) \\to 1.\n$$\n\nThis completes the description of the automorphism group.",

We need to show that every derivation has the form $D_C(X) = CX - XC$ for a unique traceless matrix $C \\in M_2(F)$.\n\n#### Show $D_C$ is a derivation\n\nLet $C \\in M_2(F)$ be traceless, i.e., $\\operatorname{tr}(C) = 0$. Define $D_C(X) = CX - XC$. We check the derivation property:\n\n$$\nD_C(X \\circ Y) = C(X \\circ Y) - (X \\circ Y)C = \\frac{1}{2}(C(XY + YX) - (XY + YX)C).\n$$\n\nCompute:\n\n$$\nD_C(X) \\circ Y = \\frac{1}{2}((CX - XC)Y + Y(CX - XC)) = \\frac{1}{2}(CXY - XCY + YCX - YXC),\n$$\n\n$$\nX \\circ D_C(Y) = \\frac{1}{2}(X(CY - YC) + (CY - YC)X) = \\frac{1}{2}(XCY - XYC + CYX - YCX).\n$$\n\nAdding these gives:\n\n$$\nD_C(X) \\circ Y + X \\circ D_C(Y) = \\frac{1}{2}(CXY - XCY + YCX - YXC + XCY - XYC + CYX - YCX).\n$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{2}(CXY + CYX - XYC - YXC) = \\frac{1}{2}(C(XY + YX) - (XY + YX)C).\n$$\n\nThis matches $D_C(X \\circ Y)$, so $D_C$ is indeed a derivation.\n\n#### Show all derivations are of this form\n\nSuppose $D$ is a derivation. Consider $D(X) = CX - XC$ for some $C$. We need to show $C$ is traceless.\n\nFor $X = I$, the identity matrix, $D(I) = CI - IC = 0$.

The group operation is given by:\n\n$$(v, e^{i\\theta}) \\cdot (w, e^{i\\phi}) = (v + R_\\theta w, e^{i(\\theta + \\phi)}),$$\n\nwhere $R_\\theta \\in SO(2)$ is the rotation matrix corresponding to the angle $\\theta$.\n\n### 1. Determine the center $Z(G)$.\n\nThe center $Z(G)$ of a group $G$ consists of all elements that commute with every element of $G$. Let $(v, e^{i\\theta}) \\in Z(G)$. For this element to be in the center, it must satisfy:\n\n$$(v, e^{i\\theta}) \\cdot (w, e^{i\\phi}) = (w, e^{i\\phi}) \\cdot (v, e^{i\\theta})$$\n\nfor all $(w, e^{i\\phi}) \\in G$. Calculating both sides, we have:\n\n1. Left side: $(v + R_\\theta w, e^{i(\\theta + \\phi)})$.\n2. Right side: $(w + R_\\phi v, e^{i(\\phi + \\theta)})$.\n\nFor these to be equal for all $w$ and $\\phi$, we need $v + R_\\theta w = w + R_\\phi v$ for all $w$. This implies $v = R_\\phi v$ for all $\\phi$, which means $v$ must be invariant under all rotations. The only vector in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ that is invariant under all rotations is the zero vector, $v = 0$.\n\nAdditionally, $e^{i(\\theta + \\phi)} = e^{i(\\phi + \\theta)}$ is trivially satisfied. Therefore, the center is:\n\n$$Z(G) = \\{(0, e^{i\\theta}) : \\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}\\} \\cong S^1.$$\n\n### 2. Determine all closed connected normal subgroups of $G$.\n\nTo find the closed connected normal subgroups of $G$, we consider the structure of $G = \\mathbb{R}^2 \\rtimes S^1$:\n\n- The subgroup $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\times \\{1\\}$ is a closed connected normal subgroup.\n- The subgroup $\\{0\\} \\times S^1$ is also a closed connected normal subgroup.\n- The whole group $G$ itself is a closed connected normal subgroup.\n\nThese are the main candidates for closed connected normal subgroups. Since $S^1$ acts transitively on $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\{0\\}$, there are no other nontrivial closed connected normal subgroups.\n\n### 3. Compute the commutator subgroup $[G, G]$ and identify the abelianization $G/[G, G]$ up to isomorphism.\n\nThe commutator subgroup $[G, G]$ is generated by elements of the form:\n\n$$[(v, e^{i\\theta}), (w, e^{i\\phi})] = (v, e^{i\\theta}) (w, e^{i\\phi}) (v, e^{i\\theta})^{-1} (w, e^{i\\phi})^{-1}.$$\n\nCalculating this, we find:\n\n1. $(v, e^{i\\theta}) (w, e^{i\\phi}) = (v + R_\\theta w, e^{i(\\theta + \\phi)})$.\n2. $(v, e^{i\\theta})^{-1} = (-R_{-\\theta} v, e^{-i\\theta})$.\n3. $(w, e^{i\\phi})^{-1} = (-R_{-\\phi} w, e^{-i\\phi})$.\n\nThe commutator becomes:\n\n$$[(v, e^{i\\theta}), (w, e^{i\\phi})] = (R_\\theta w - R_{-\\phi} v, 1).$$\n\nThe commutator subgroup $[G, G]$ is generated by elements of the form $(R_\\theta w - R_{-\\phi} v, 1)$, which span $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Therefore, $[G, G] = \\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nThe abelianization $G/[G, G]$ is isomorphic to $S^1$, since $G/[G, G] \\cong (\\mathbb{R}^2 \\rtimes S^1)/\\mathbb{R}^2 \\cong S^1$.\n\n### 4. Classify all continuous group homomorphisms (continuous characters) $\\chi: G \\to S^1$.\n\nA continuous character $\\chi: G \\to S^1$ is a homomorphism such that:\n\n1. $\\chi((v, e^{i\\theta}) \\cdot (w, e^{i\\phi})) = \\chi((v, e^{i\\theta})) \\chi((w, e^{i\\phi}))$.\n2. $\\chi$ is continuous.\n\nSince $[G, G] = \\mathbb{R}^2$, any character $\\chi$ must be trivial on $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Therefore, $\\chi(v, e^{i\\theta}) = \\chi(0, e^{i\\theta})$.\n\nThus, $\\chi$ is determined by its value on $S^1$. The continuous homomorphisms from $S^1$ to $S^1$ are of the form $\\chi(e^{i\\theta}) = e^{in\\theta}$ for some integer $n$. Therefore, the continuous characters of $G$ are given by:\n\n$$\\chi(v, e^{i\\theta}) = e^{in\\theta}, \\quad n \\in \\mathbb{Z}.$$\n\nIn conclusion, the answers are:\n\n1. $Z(G) = \\{(0, e^{i\\theta}) : \\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}\\} \\cong S^1$.\n2.

        "raw_answer": "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the structure of the group $G = \\mathbb{R}^2 \\rtimes S^1$, where $S^1 = \\{e^{i\\theta} : \\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$ acts on $\\mathbb{R}^2$ by rotations. The group operation is given by:\n\n$$(v, e^{i\\theta}) \\cdot (w, e^{i\\phi}) = (v + R_\\theta w, e^{i(\\theta + \\phi)}),$$\n\nwhere $R_\\theta \\in SO(2)$ is the rotation matrix corresponding to the angle $\\theta$.\n\n### 1. Determine the center $Z(G)$.\n\nThe center $Z(G)$ of a group $G$ consists of all elements that commute with every element of $G$. Let $(v, e^{i\\theta}) \\in Z(G)$. For this element to be in the center, it must satisfy:\n\n$$(v, e^{i\\theta}) \\cdot (w, e^{i\\phi}) = (w, e^{i\\phi}) \\cdot (v, e^{i\\theta})$$\n\nfor all $(w, e^{i\\phi}) \\in G$. Calculating both sides, we have:\n\n1. Left side: $(v + R_\\theta w, e^{i(\\theta + \\phi)})$.\n2. Right side: $(w + R_\\phi v, e^{i(\\phi + \\theta)})$.\n\nFor these to be equal for all $w$ and $\\phi$, we need $v + R_\\theta w = w + R_\\phi v$ for all $w$. This implies $v = R_\\phi v$ for all $\\phi$, which means $v$ must be invariant under all rotations. The only vector in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ that is invariant under all rotations is the zero vector, $v = 0$.\n\nAdditionally, $e^{i(\\theta + \\phi)} = e^{i(\\phi + \\theta)}$ is trivially satisfied. Therefore, the center is:\n\n$$Z(G) = \\{(0, e^{i\\theta}) : \\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}\\} \\cong S^1.$$\n\n### 2. Determine all closed connected normal subgroups of $G$.\n\nTo find the closed connected normal subgroups of $G$, we consider the structure of $G = \\mathbb{R}^2 \\rtimes S^1$:\n\n- The subgroup $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\times \\{1\\}$ is a closed connected normal subgroup.\n- The subgroup $\\{0\\} \\times S^1$ is also a closed connected normal subgroup.\n- The whole group $G$ itself is a closed connected normal subgroup.\n\nThese are the main candidates for closed connected normal subgroups. Since $S^1$ acts transitively on $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\{0\\}$, there are no other nontrivial closed connected normal subgroups.\n\n### 3. Compute the commutator subgroup $[G, G]$ and identify the abelianization $G/[G, G]$ up to isomorphism.\n\nThe commutator subgroup $[G, G]$ is generated by elements of the form:\n\n$$[(v, e^{i\\theta}), (w, e^{i\\phi})] = (v, e^{i\\theta}) (w, e^{i\\phi}) (v, e^{i\\theta})^{-1} (w, e^{i\\phi})^{-1}.$$\n\nCalculating this, we find:\n\n1. $(v, e^{i\\theta}) (w, e^{i\\phi}) = (v + R_\\theta w, e^{i(\\theta + \\phi)})$.\n2. $(v, e^{i\\theta})^{-1} = (-R_{-\\theta} v, e^{-i\\theta})$.\n3. $(w, e^{i\\phi})^{-1} = (-R_{-\\phi} w, e^{-i\\phi})$.\n\nThe commutator becomes:\n\n$$[(v, e^{i\\theta}), (w, e^{i\\phi})] = (R_\\theta w - R_{-\\phi} v, 1).$$\n\nThe commutator subgroup $[G, G]$ is generated by elements of the form $(R_\\theta w - R_{-\\phi} v, 1)$, which span $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Therefore, $[G, G] = \\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nThe abelianization $G/[G, G]$ is isomorphic to $S^1$, since $G/[G, G] \\cong (\\mathbb{R}^2 \\rtimes S^1)/\\mathbb{R}^2 \\cong S^1$.\n\n### 4. Classify all continuous group homomorphisms (continuous characters) $\\chi: G \\to S^1$.\n\nA continuous character $\\chi: G \\to S^1$ is a homomorphism such that:\n\n1. $\\chi((v, e^{i\\theta}) \\cdot (w, e^{i\\phi})) = \\chi((v, e^{i\\theta})) \\chi((w, e^{i\\phi}))$.\n2. $\\chi$ is continuous.\n\nSince $[G, G] = \\mathbb{R}^2$, any character $\\chi$ must be trivial on $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Therefore, $\\chi(v, e^{i\\theta}) = \\chi(0, e^{i\\theta})$.\n\nThus, $\\chi$ is determined by its value on $S^1$. The continuous homomorphisms from $S^1$ to $S^1$ are of the form $\\chi(e^{i\\theta}) = e^{in\\theta}$ for some integer $n$. Therefore, the continuous characters of $G$ are given by:\n\n$$\\chi(v, e^{i\\theta}) = e^{in\\theta}, \\quad n \\in \\mathbb{Z}.$$\n\nIn conclusion, the answers are:\n\n1. $Z(G) = \\{(0, e^{i\\theta}) : \\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}\\} \\cong S^1$.\n2. Closed connected normal subgroups: $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\times \\{1\\}$, $\\{0\\} \\times S^1$, and $G$ itself.\n3. $[G, G] = \\mathbb{R}^2$, and $G/[G, G] \\cong S^1$.\n4.

Specifically, for complex parameters $\\alpha$ and $\\nu$ satisfying the given condition, the integral can be expressed in terms of Gamma functions as follows:\n\n$$\nI(\\alpha, \\nu) = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi} \\, \\Gamma\\left(\\alpha - \\nu\\right) \\Gamma\\left(\\alpha + \\nu\\right)}{2^{\\alpha+1} \\Gamma\\left(\\alpha + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)}.\n$$\n\n### Justification:\n\n1. **Convergence Condition**: The condition $\\Re(\\alpha) > 2|\\Re(\\nu)|$ ensures that the integral converges. This is because the asymptotic behavior of $K_\\nu(x)$ for small $x$ is $K_\\nu(x) \\sim \\frac{1}{2} \\Gamma(\\nu) \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^{-\\nu}$, and for large $x$, $K_\\nu(x)$ decays exponentially. The condition on $\\alpha$ ensures that the integrand $x^{\\alpha-1} K_\\nu(x)^2$ is integrable at both $0$ and $\\infty$.\n\n2. **Use of Known Result**: The integral of the square of the modified Bessel function of the second kind is a well-documented result in mathematical literature. The expression given above is derived using properties of Bessel functions and their integral representations.\n\n3. **Gamma Functions**: The appearance of Gamma functions in the result is typical when dealing with integrals involving Bessel functions, due to their connection with hypergeometric functions and Mellin transforms.\n\n4. **Principal Branch**: The use of the principal branch $x^{\\alpha-1} = e^{(\\alpha-1)\\ln x}$ for $x > 0$ is standard and ensures that the power function is well-defined for complex $\\alpha$.\n\nThus, the integral evaluates to:\n\n$$\nI(\\alpha, \\nu) = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi} \\, \\Gamma\\left(\\alpha - \\nu\\right) \\Gamma\\left(\\alpha + \\nu\\right)}{2^{\\alpha+1} \\Gamma\\left(\\alpha + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)}.\n$$\n\nThis expression is valid under the condition $\\Re(\\alpha) > 2|\\Re(\\nu)|$, ensuring the convergence of the integral.",

If $\\infty \\in U_j$ for some $j \\in I$, then $U_j = \\alpha X \\setminus K$ for some compact set $K \\subseteq X$. The sets $\\{U_i\\}_{i \\in I, i \\neq j}$ cover $K$ since $K \\subseteq X$ and $X \\subseteq \\alpha X$. Since $K$ is compact, there exists a finite subcover $\\{U_{i_1}, U_{i_2}, \\ldots, U_{i_n}\\}$ of $K$. Therefore, $\\{U_j, U_{i_1}, U_{i_2}, \\ldots, U_{i_n}\\}$ is a finite subcover of $\\alpha X$.\n\nIf no $U_i$ contains $\\infty$, then $\\{U_i\\}_{i \\in I}$ is an open cover of $X$. However, this contradicts the assumption that $X$ is non-compact, as $X$ would then have a finite subcover, which is not possible.

Compute $H_i(L(p,q);\\mathbb{Z})$ for all $i$.\n\nThe homology groups $H_i(L(p,q);\\mathbb{Z})$ can be computed using the cellular chain complex given in the problem. The chain complex is:\n$$\n0 \\to \\mathbb{Z}[\\mathbb{Z}/p] \\xrightarrow{d_3} \\mathbb{Z}[\\mathbb{Z}/p] \\xrightarrow{d_2} \\mathbb{Z}[\\mathbb{Z}/p] \\xrightarrow{d_1} \\mathbb{Z}[\\mathbb{Z}/p] \\to 0,\n$$\nwith $d_1 = t - 1$, $d_2 = 1 + t + t^2 + \\cdots + t^{p-1}$, and $d_3 = t^q - 1$.\n\n- **$H_0(L(p,q);\\mathbb{Z})$**: The kernel of $d_1$ is the set of elements fixed by $t$, which is $\\mathbb{Z}$, and the image of $d_1$ is $(t-1)\\mathbb{Z}[\\mathbb{Z}/p]$. The quotient gives $H_0(L(p,q);\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n- **$H_1(L(p,q);\\mathbb{Z})$**: The kernel of $d_2$ is the set of elements annihilated by $1 + t + \\cdots + t^{p-1}$, which is the augmentation ideal. The image of $d_1$ is $(t-1)\\mathbb{Z}[\\mathbb{Z}/p]$. The quotient gives $H_1(L(p,q);\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/p$.\n\n- **$H_2(L(p,q);\\mathbb{Z})$**: The kernel of $d_3$ is the set of elements annihilated by $t^q - 1$. The image of $d_2$ is the augmentation ideal, which is the kernel of the augmentation map. The quotient gives $H_2(L(p,q);\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/p$.\n\n- **$H_3(L(p,q);\\mathbb{Z})$**: The kernel of $d_3$ is all of $\\mathbb{Z}[\\mathbb{Z}/p]$, and since there is no $d_4$, $H_3(L(p,q);\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThus, the homology groups are:\n$$\nH_0(L(p,q);\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}, \\quad H_1(L(p,q);\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/p, \\quad H_2(L(p,q);\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/p, \\quad H_3(L(p,q);\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}.\n$$\n\n### 3.

The ring structure is determined by the cup product.\n\nFor $p = 2$, the ring is generated by a degree 1 element $x$ with $x^2 = 0$, so:\n$$ H^*(L(2,q);\\mathbb{Z}/2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2[x]/(x^2). $$\n\nFor $p$ odd, the ring is generated by a degree 1 element $x$ and a degree 2 element $y$ with $x^2 = 0$ and $y^2 = 0$, so:\n$$ H^*(L(p,q);\\mathbb{Z}/p) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/p[x,y]/(x^2, y^2). $$\n\n### 4. For which $p,q$ is $L(p,q)$ an integral homology $3$\u2013sphere?\n\nAn integral homology $3$-sphere has the same homology as $S^3$, which means $H_1(L(p,q);\\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ and $H_2(L(p,q);\\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. From our previous computation, this occurs if and only if $p = 1$, which is not allowed since $p \\geq 2$. Therefore, there are no $p, q$ such that $L(p,q)$ is an integral homology $3$-sphere.\n\nIn conclusion, the answers are:\n1. $\\pi_1(L(p,q)) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/p$.\n2. $H_0(L(p,q);\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, $H_1(L(p,q);\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/p$, $H_2(L(p,q);\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/p$, $H_3(L(p,q);\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n3. $H^*(L(2,q);\\mathbb{Z}/2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2[x]/(x^2)$ for $p=2$; $H^*(L(p,q);\\mathbb{Z}/p) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/p[x,y]/(x^2, y^2)$ for $p$ odd.\n4.
