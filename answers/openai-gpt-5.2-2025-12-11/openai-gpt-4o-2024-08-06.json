        "answer": "To construct a nonprincipal ultrafilter on $\\omega$, we will use the Compactness Theorem for first-order logic. The idea is to construct a set of sentences that describe the properties of a nonprincipal ultrafilter and then use the Compactness Theorem to show that this set has a model, which will correspond to the desired ultrafilter.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Language and Sentences\n\nConsider a first-order language $\\mathcal{L}$ with a unary predicate $P_A$ for each subset $A \\subseteq \\omega$. The intended interpretation is that $P_A$ holds if and only if $A$ is in the ultrafilter.\n\nWe will construct a set of sentences $T$ in this language that captures the properties of a nonprincipal ultrafilter:\n\n1. **Filter Properties:**\n   - $\\forall x (P_\\omega(x))$ (i.e., $\\omega \\in \\mathcal{U}$).\n   - $\\forall x ((P_A(x) \\wedge \\forall y (A(y) \\rightarrow B(y))) \\rightarrow P_B(x))$ for all $A \\subseteq B \\subseteq \\omega$ (i.e., if $A \\in \\mathcal{U}$ and $A \\subseteq B$, then $B \\in \\mathcal{U}$).\n   - $\\forall x ((P_A(x) \\wedge P_B(x)) \\rightarrow P_{A \\cap B}(x))$ for all $A, B \\subseteq \\omega$ (i.e., if $A, B \\in \\mathcal{U}$, then $A \\cap B \\in \\mathcal{U}$).\n\n2. **Ultrafilter Property:**\n   - $\\forall x (P_A(x) \\vee P_{\\omega \\setminus A}(x))$ for all $A \\subseteq \\omega$ (i.e., for every $A \\subseteq \\omega$, either $A \\in \\mathcal{U}$ or $\\omega \\setminus A \\in \\mathcal{U}$).\n\n3. **Nonprincipal Property:**\n   - $\\forall x (\\neg P_{\\{n\\}}(x))$ for each $n \\in \\omega$ (i.e., $\\{n\\} \\notin \\mathcal{U}$ for each $n$).\n\n### Step 2: Apply the Compactness Theorem\n\nTo apply the Compactness Theorem, we need to show that every finite subset of $T$ has a model. Consider any finite subset $T_0 \\subseteq T$. This subset only involves finitely many sets $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_k \\subseteq \\omega$ and finitely many conditions of the form $\\neg P_{\\{n\\}}$.\n\nConstruct a filter $\\mathcal{F}$ on $\\omega$ that includes all $A_i$ and excludes all $\\{n\\}$ mentioned in $T_0$. Such a filter can be constructed by taking the filter generated by the sets $A_i$ and ensuring it does not contain any $\\{n\\}$. This is possible because the intersection of finitely many cofinite sets is cofinite, and we can always find a cofinite set that avoids any finite set of natural numbers.\n\nSince every finite subset $T_0$ has a model (a filter $\\mathcal{F}$ as described), by the Compactness Theorem, the entire set $T$ has a model. This model corresponds to an ultrafilter $\\mathcal{U}$ on $\\omega$.\n\n### Step 3: Verify the Properties\n\n1. **Filter Properties:**\n   - $\\omega \\in \\mathcal{U}$ by construction.\n   - If $A \\in \\mathcal{U}$ and $A \\subseteq B$, then $B \\in \\mathcal{U}$ by the sentence $\\forall x ((P_A(x) \\wedge \\forall y (A(y) \\rightarrow B(y))) \\rightarrow P_B(x))$.\n   - If $A, B \\in \\mathcal{U}$, then $A \\cap B \\in \\mathcal{U}$ by the sentence $\\forall x ((P_A(x) \\wedge P_B(x)) \\rightarrow P_{A \\cap B}(x))$.\n\n2. **Ultrafilter Property:**\n   - For every $A \\subseteq \\omega$, exactly one of $A$ or $\\omega \\setminus A$ is in $\\mathcal{U}$ by the sentence $\\forall x (P_A(x) \\vee P_{\\omega \\setminus A}(x))$.\n\n3. **Nonprincipal Property:**\n   - For every $n \\in \\omega$, $\\{n\\} \\notin \\mathcal{U}$ by the sentence $\\forall x (\\neg P_{\\{n\\}}(x))$.\n\nThus, $\\mathcal{U}$ is a nonprincipal ultrafilter on $\\omega$.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThere exists a nonprincipal ultrafilter $\\mathcal{U}$ on $\\omega$ constructed using the Compactness Theorem, satisfying all the required properties.",
