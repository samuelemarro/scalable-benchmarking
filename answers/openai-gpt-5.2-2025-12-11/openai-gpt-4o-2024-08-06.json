        "answer": "To address the problem, we need to work through the three parts systematically. Let's start with each part:\n\n### Part 1: Prove that $T$ is consistent\n\nTo show that $T$ is consistent, we need to demonstrate that every finite subset of $T$ has a model. We will then use the Compactness Theorem to conclude that $T$ itself has a model.\n\n**Step 1: Finite Subsets of $T$**\n\nConsider a finite subset $T_0$ of $T$. This subset will include:\n- The two graph axioms:\n  1. $\\forall x\\,\\neg E(x,x)$ (no loops)\n  2. $\\forall x\\forall y\\,(E(x,y)\\leftrightarrow E(y,x))$ (symmetry)\n- A finite number of extension axioms for specific pairs of integers $(m_i, n_i)$, where $1 \\leq i \\leq k$ for some $k$.\n\n**Step 2: Construct a Model for $T_0$**\n\nWe can construct a model for $T_0$ by considering a graph $G$ with a sufficiently large set of vertices. Specifically, we can take $G$ to be an infinite set of vertices, such as $\\mathbb{N}$, and define $E$ such that it satisfies the graph axioms and the extension axioms in $T_0$.\n\nFor each extension axiom in $T_0$, we need to ensure that for any disjoint sets $U$ and $V$ of sizes $m_i$ and $n_i$, respectively, there exists a vertex $z$ that realizes the adjacency pattern $(U, V)$. Since $G$ is infinite, we can always find such a $z$ that is not in $U \\cup V$ and satisfies the required adjacency conditions.\n\n**Step 3: Invoke the Compactness Theorem**\n\nSince every finite subset $T_0$ of $T$ has a model, by the Compactness Theorem, the entire theory $T$ has a model. Therefore, $T$ is consistent.\n\n### Part 2: Deduce that $T$ has a countable model\n\nTo show that $T$ has a countable model, we use the Downward L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem Theorem. This theorem states that if a first-order theory has an infinite model, then it has a countable model.\n\nSince we have established that $T$ has a model (from Part 1), and this model is infinite (as it must satisfy the extension axioms for all finite disjoint sets $U$ and $V$), the Downward L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem Theorem guarantees the existence of a countable model of $T$.\n\n### Part 3: Prove that any two countable models of $T$ are isomorphic\n\nTo prove that any two countable models of $T$ are isomorphic, we use a back-and-forth construction. This method is suitable for showing $\\aleph_0$-categoricity.\n\n**Step 1: Setup**\n\nLet $M_1$ and $M_2$ be two countable models of $T$. We will construct an isomorphism between them by building a sequence of partial isomorphisms.\n\n**Step 2: Back-and-Forth Construction**\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start with the empty partial isomorphism $\\varphi_0: \\emptyset \\to \\emptyset$.\n\n2. **Inductive Step**: Assume we have a partial isomorphism $\\varphi_n: A_n \\to B_n$ where $A_n \\subseteq M_1$ and $B_n \\subseteq M_2$ are finite.\n\n   - **Forth Step**: Choose an element $a \\in M_1 \\setminus A_n$.

We need to place the 4 black beads in the gaps between these dividers. Since the beads are on a circle, we can use a gap between the last and the first bead as well. \n\nWe can visualize this as arranging 6 white beads in a line and choosing 4 of the 7 gaps (6 between the beads and 1 around the circle) to place a black bead.

For a coloring to be fixed, each bead must be the same color as the bead 5 positions away. This is impossible with 4 black and 6 white beads. Thus, no colorings are fixed.\n\n#### Reflections\n\nConsider a reflection through a line passing through a bead or between two beads:\n\n- **Reflections through a bead (5 such reflections):** For a coloring to be fixed, the beads must be symmetric about the line. This requires pairs of opposite beads to be the same color.

By definition, $d$ divides both $2^m - 1$ and $2^n + 1$. Therefore, $d$ must also divide any integer linear combination of these two numbers. In particular, $d$ divides:\n\n1. $2^m - 1$,\n2. $2^n + 1$,\n3. $2^m(2^n + 1) = 2^{m+n} + 2^m$.\n\nFrom the above, $d$ divides $2^{m+n} + 2^m - (2^m)(2^n + 1) = 2^{m+n} + 2^m - 2^{m+n} - 2^m = -2^m$. Thus, $d$ divides $2^m$.\n\nSimilarly, $d$ divides $2^n(2^m - 1) = 2^{m+n} - 2^n$. Therefore, $d$ divides $2^{m+n} - 2^n + (2^n + 1) = 2^{m+n} - 2^n + 2^n + 1 = 2^{m+n} + 1$.

Since $[L : \\mathbb{Q}] = 8$, $G$ is a group of order 8.\n\nConsider the automorphisms of $L$. The automorphisms are determined by their action on $\\alpha$ and $i$. Let $\\sigma \\in G$ be defined by $\\sigma(\\alpha) = i\\alpha$ and $\\sigma(i) = i$. This automorphism corresponds to a $90^\\circ$ rotation in the complex plane among the roots of $x^4 - 2$. Let $\\tau \\in G$ be defined by $\\tau(\\alpha) = \\alpha$ and $\\tau(i) = -i$. This automorphism corresponds to complex conjugation.\n\nThe automorphisms $\\sigma$ and $\\tau$ generate $G$. We have $\\sigma^4 = \\mathrm{id}$ because $\\sigma^4(\\alpha) = \\alpha$ and $\\sigma^4(i) = i$. Also, $\\tau^2 = \\mathrm{id}$ because $\\tau(i) = -i$ and $\\tau^2(i) = i$. Furthermore, $\\sigma \\tau = \\tau \\sigma^3$, which can be verified by checking their actions on $\\alpha$ and $i$.\n\nThe relations $\\sigma^4 = \\mathrm{id}$, $\\tau^2 = \\mathrm{id}$, and $\\sigma \\tau = \\tau \\sigma^3$ define the dihedral group $D_4$, which is the symmetry group of a square. Therefore, $G \\cong D_4$.\n\n**Conclusion for Part 2:** $G = \\mathrm{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong D_4$, generated by $\\sigma$ and $\\tau$ with relations $\\sigma^4 = \\mathrm{id}$, $\\tau^2 = \\mathrm{id}$, and $\\sigma \\tau = \\tau \\sigma^3$.\n\n### Part 3: Determine all intermediate fields $\\mathbb{Q} \\subseteq F \\subseteq L$.\n\nThe intermediate fields correspond to the subgroups of the Galois group $G \\cong D_4$. The subgroups of $D_4$ are:\n\n1. The trivial subgroup $\\{ \\mathrm{id} \\}$, corresponding to $L$ itself.\n2. The whole group $D_4$, corresponding to $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n3. The cyclic subgroups of order 2: $\\langle \\tau \\rangle$, $\\langle \\sigma^2 \\rangle$, and $\\langle \\sigma^2 \\tau \\rangle$.\n4. The cyclic subgroups of order 4: $\\langle \\sigma \\rangle$ and $\\langle \\sigma^3 \\rangle$.\n5. The Klein four-group $V_4 = \\{ \\mathrm{id}, \\sigma^2, \\tau, \\sigma^2 \\tau \\}$.\n\nNow, we describe the corresponding intermediate fields:\n\n1. $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha, i)$ corresponds to the trivial subgroup.\n2. $\\mathbb{Q}$ corresponds to the whole group $D_4$.\n3. $\\mathbb{Q}(i)$ corresponds to $\\langle \\sigma^2 \\rangle$, since $\\sigma^2(\\alpha) = -\\alpha$ and $\\sigma^2(i) = i$.\n4. $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha^2)$ corresponds to $\\langle \\tau \\rangle$, since $\\tau(\\alpha) = \\alpha$ and $\\tau(i) = -i$.\n5. $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha^2 i)$ corresponds to $\\langle \\sigma^2 \\tau \\rangle$, since $\\sigma^2 \\tau(\\alpha) = -\\alpha$ and $\\sigma^2 \\tau(i) = -i$.\n6. $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$ corresponds to $\\langle \\sigma \\rangle$, since $\\sigma(\\alpha) = i\\alpha$ and $\\sigma(i) = i$.\n7. $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha i)$ corresponds to $\\langle \\sigma^3 \\rangle$, since $\\sigma^3(\\alpha) = -i\\alpha$ and $\\sigma^3(i) = i$.\n8. $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha^2, i)$ corresponds to $V_4$, since $V_4$ fixes $\\alpha^2$ and $i$.\n\n**Conclusion for Part 3:** The intermediate fields are:\n- $\\mathbb{Q}$\n- $\\mathbb{Q}(i)$\n- $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha^2)$\n- $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha^2 i)$\n- $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$\n- $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha i)$\n- $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha^2, i)$\n- $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha, i)$\n\nEach field is described by its generators, and the degree over $\\mathbb{Q}$ can be determined by the index of the corresponding subgroup in $D_4$.",

The Jacobian matrix of the relation $xy - z^n = 0$ is $J = [y, x, -nz^{n-1}]$. The rank of this matrix is less than 2 if and only if all partial derivatives vanish simultaneously, i.e., $y = 0$, $x = 0$, and $z = 0$. This occurs only at the point $(x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0)$.

The order of $[D]$ in $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$ is $n$. This is because the relation $xy = z^n$ implies that $nD$ is linearly equivalent to zero in the divisor class group, as $nD$ corresponds to the principal divisor of the function $z$. \n\nTo show that $[D]$ generates $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$, note that any divisor class in $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$ can be expressed as a multiple of $[D]$, since $\\mathrm{Cl}(A) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ is cyclic of order $n$.

We denote by $x, y \\in A$ the residue classes of the free generators, and set $w = xy \\in A$.\n\n### Part 1: Show that $A$ is 4-dimensional over $k$ with basis $\\{1, x, y, w\\}$ and determine the products among these basis elements.\n\n**Step 1: Determine a basis for $A$.**\n\nThe relations $x^2 = 0$, $y^2 = 0$, and $xy + yx = 0$ imply that any element of $A$ can be expressed as a $k$-linear combination of monomials of the form $1$, $x$, $y$, and $xy$. \n\n- $x^2 = 0$ implies no monomial of degree 2 or higher in $x$ is nonzero.\n- $y^2 = 0$ implies no monomial of degree 2 or higher in $y$ is nonzero.\n- $xy + yx = 0$ implies $yx = -xy = -w$.\n\nThus, any product of $x$ and $y$ can be reduced to a linear combination of $1$, $x$, $y$, and $w = xy$. Therefore, $\\{1, x, y, w\\}$ spans $A$.\n\n**Step 2: Show linear independence.**\n\nSuppose $a + bx + cy + dw = 0$ for some $a, b, c, d \\in k$. Evaluating this at the basis elements, we have:\n\n- The constant term gives $a = 0$.\n- The coefficient of $x$ gives $b = 0$.\n- The coefficient of $y$ gives $c = 0$.\n- The coefficient of $w$ gives $d = 0$.\n\nThus, $\\{1, x, y, w\\}$ is linearly independent, and hence a basis for $A$. Therefore, $A$ is 4-dimensional over $k$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the products among the basis elements.**\n\n- $x^2 = 0$, $y^2 = 0$ by definition.\n- $xy = w$ by definition.\n- $yx = -xy = -w$ by the relation $xy + yx = 0$.\n- $xw = x(xy) = 0$ since $x^2 = 0$.\n- $yw = y(xy) = 0$ since $y^2 = 0$.\n- $wx = (xy)x = 0$ since $x^2 = 0$.\n- $wy = (xy)y = 0$ since $y^2 = 0$.\n- $w^2 = (xy)(xy) = x(yx)y = x(-xy)y = -x(xy)y = 0$ since $x^2 = 0$.\n\n### Part 2: Determine the Jacobson radical $J(A)$ and its powers $J(A)^2, J(A)^3$. Deduce that $A$ is a local algebra. Classify all two-sided ideals of $A$.\n\n**Step 1: Determine $J(A)$.**\n\nThe Jacobson radical $J(A)$ is the intersection of all maximal left ideals of $A$. Since $A$ is finite-dimensional over a field, $J(A)$ is the set of all elements that act nilpotently on every simple $A$-module.\n\nFrom the relations, $x, y, w$ are nilpotent elements. Therefore, $J(A)$ contains the ideal generated by $x, y, w$. Since $A$ is 4-dimensional and $J(A)$ is a nilpotent ideal, $J(A) = \\langle x, y, w \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: Compute $J(A)^2$ and $J(A)^3$.**\n\n- $J(A)^2 = \\langle x, y, w \\rangle^2 = \\langle xy, yx, xw, yw, wx, wy, w^2 \\rangle = \\langle w \\rangle$.\n- $J(A)^3 = \\langle w \\rangle^2 = \\langle w^2 \\rangle = \\langle 0 \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 3: Show $A$ is a local algebra.**\n\nAn algebra is local if it has a unique maximal left ideal. Since $J(A)$ is the unique maximal ideal (as $J(A)^2 = \\langle w \\rangle$ and $J(A)^3 = 0$), $A$ is local.\n\n**Step 4: Classify all two-sided ideals of $A$.**\n\nThe two-sided ideals of $A$ are $\\{0\\}$, $\\langle w \\rangle$, $\\langle x, y, w \\rangle = J(A)$, and $A$ itself. These are all the possible ideals since $A$ is 4-dimensional and local.\n\n### Part 3: Compute the center $Z(A)$.\n\nThe center $Z(A)$ consists of elements that commute with all elements of $A$. \n\n- Any element $z \\in Z(A)$ can be written as $z = a + bx + cy + dw$.\n- For $z$ to commute with $x$, $y$, and $w$, we must have:\n  - $zx = xz$, $zy = yz$, $zw = wz$.\n\nChecking these conditions:\n\n- $zx = (a + bx + cy + dw)x = bx$ must equal $xz = x(a + bx + cy + dw) = ax + dwx = ax$.\n  - This implies $b = 0$ and $d = 0$.\n- $zy = (a + cy)y = cy$ must equal $yz = y(a + cy) = ay$.\n  - This implies $c = 0$.\n\nThus, $z = a \\in k$. Therefore, $Z(A) = k$.\n\n### Part 4: Describe $\\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A)$.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the form of automorphisms.**\n\nLet $\\varphi \\in \\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A)$. Then $\\varphi(x)$ and $\\varphi(y)$ must satisfy the same relations as $x$ and $y$:\n\n- $\\varphi(x)^2 = 0$, $\\varphi(y)^2 = 0$, $\\varphi(x)\\varphi(y) + \\varphi(y)\\varphi(x) = 0$.\n\nAssume $\\varphi(x) = ax + by + \\alpha w$ and $\\varphi(y) = cx + dy + \\beta w$ for some $a, b, c, d, \\alpha, \\beta \\in k$.\n\n- $\\varphi(x)^2 = (ax + by + \\alpha w)^2 = 0$ implies $a^2 = 0$, $b^2 = 0$, and $ab = 0$.\n- $\\varphi(y)^2 = (cx + dy + \\beta w)^2 = 0$ implies $c^2 = 0$, $d^2 = 0$, and $cd = 0$.\n- $\\varphi(x)\\varphi(y) + \\varphi(y)\\varphi(x) = 0$ implies $ad + bc = 0$.\n\nSince $a, b, c, d$ must satisfy these conditions and $a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = d^2 = 0$, we have $a, b, c, d \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the matrix condition.**\n\nThe condition $ad + bc = 0$ implies that $\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathrm{GL}_2(k)$, meaning it is invertible. This is possible if $a, b, c, d$ are such that the determinant $ad - bc \\neq 0$.\n\n**Step 3: Describe the automorphism group.**\n\nThe automorphisms are determined by the choice of $a, b, c, d, \\alpha, \\beta$ such that $\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathrm{GL}_2(k)$, and $\\alpha, \\beta \\in k$ are arbitrary.\n\nThe map $\\varphi(x) = ax + by + \\alpha w$, $\\varphi(y) = cx + dy + \\beta w$ gives a homomorphism from $\\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A)$ to $\\mathrm{GL}_2(k)$, with kernel consisting of maps of the form $\\varphi(x) = x + \\alpha w$, $\\varphi(y) = y + \\beta w$, which is isomorphic to $k^2$.\n\nThus, we have a split short exact sequence:\n$$\n1 \\to k^2 \\to \\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A) \\to \\mathrm{GL}_2(k) \\to 1.\n$$\n\nThis completes the description of the automorphism group.",

Deduce that $A$ is a local algebra. Classify all two-sided ideals of $A$.\n\n**Step 1: Determine $J(A)$.**\n\nThe Jacobson radical $J(A)$ is the intersection of all maximal left ideals of $A$. Since $A$ is finite-dimensional over a field, $J(A)$ is the set of all elements that act nilpotently on every simple $A$-module.\n\nFrom the relations, $x, y, w$ are nilpotent elements. Therefore, $J(A)$ contains the ideal generated by $x, y, w$. Since $A$ is 4-dimensional and $J(A)$ is a nilpotent ideal, $J(A) = \\langle x, y, w \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: Compute $J(A)^2$ and $J(A)^3$.**\n\n- $J(A)^2 = \\langle x, y, w \\rangle^2 = \\langle xy, yx, xw, yw, wx, wy, w^2 \\rangle = \\langle w \\rangle$.\n- $J(A)^3 = \\langle w \\rangle^2 = \\langle w^2 \\rangle = \\langle 0 \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 3: Show $A$ is a local algebra.**\n\nAn algebra is local if it has a unique maximal left ideal. Since $J(A)$ is the unique maximal ideal (as $J(A)^2 = \\langle w \\rangle$ and $J(A)^3 = 0$), $A$ is local.\n\n**Step 4: Classify all two-sided ideals of $A$.**\n\nThe two-sided ideals of $A$ are $\\{0\\}$, $\\langle w \\rangle$, $\\langle x, y, w \\rangle = J(A)$, and $A$ itself. These are all the possible ideals since $A$ is 4-dimensional and local.\n\n### Part 3: Compute the center $Z(A)$.\n\nThe center $Z(A)$ consists of elements that commute with all elements of $A$. \n\n- Any element $z \\in Z(A)$ can be written as $z = a + bx + cy + dw$.\n- For $z$ to commute with $x$, $y$, and $w$, we must have:\n  - $zx = xz$, $zy = yz$, $zw = wz$.\n\nChecking these conditions:\n\n- $zx = (a + bx + cy + dw)x = bx$ must equal $xz = x(a + bx + cy + dw) = ax + dwx = ax$.\n  - This implies $b = 0$ and $d = 0$.\n- $zy = (a + cy)y = cy$ must equal $yz = y(a + cy) = ay$.\n  - This implies $c = 0$.\n\nThus, $z = a \\in k$.

We denote by $x, y \\in A$ the residue classes of the free generators, and set $w = xy \\in A$.\n\n### Part 1: Show that $A$ is 4-dimensional over $k$ with basis $\\{1, x, y, w\\}$ and determine the products among these basis elements.\n\n**Step 1: Determine a basis for $A$.**\n\nThe relations $x^2 = 0$, $y^2 = 0$, and $xy + yx = 0$ imply that any element of $A$ can be expressed as a $k$-linear combination of monomials of the form $1$, $x$, $y$, and $xy$. \n\n- $x^2 = 0$ implies no monomial of degree 2 or higher in $x$ is nonzero.\n- $y^2 = 0$ implies no monomial of degree 2 or higher in $y$ is nonzero.\n- $xy + yx = 0$ implies $yx = -xy = -w$.\n\nThus, any product of $x$ and $y$ can be reduced to a linear combination of $1$, $x$, $y$, and $w = xy$. Therefore, $\\{1, x, y, w\\}$ spans $A$.\n\n**Step 2: Show linear independence.**\n\nSuppose $a + bx + cy + dw = 0$ for some $a, b, c, d \\in k$. Evaluating this at the basis elements, we have:\n\n- The constant term gives $a = 0$.\n- The coefficient of $x$ gives $b = 0$.\n- The coefficient of $y$ gives $c = 0$.\n- The coefficient of $w$ gives $d = 0$.\n\nThus, $\\{1, x, y, w\\}$ is linearly independent, and hence a basis for $A$. Therefore, $A$ is 4-dimensional over $k$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the products among the basis elements.**\n\n- $x^2 = 0$, $y^2 = 0$ by definition.\n- $xy = w$ by definition.\n- $yx = -xy = -w$ by the relation $xy + yx = 0$.\n- $xw = x(xy) = 0$ since $x^2 = 0$.\n- $yw = y(xy) = 0$ since $y^2 = 0$.\n- $wx = (xy)x = 0$ since $x^2 = 0$.\n- $wy = (xy)y = 0$ since $y^2 = 0$.\n- $w^2 = (xy)(xy) = x(yx)y = x(-xy)y = -x(xy)y = 0$ since $x^2 = 0$.\n\n### Part 2: Determine the Jacobson radical $J(A)$ and its powers $J(A)^2, J(A)^3$. Deduce that $A$ is a local algebra. Classify all two-sided ideals of $A$.\n\n**Step 1: Determine $J(A)$.**\n\nThe Jacobson radical $J(A)$ is the intersection of all maximal left ideals of $A$. Since $A$ is finite-dimensional over a field, $J(A)$ is the set of all elements that act nilpotently on every simple $A$-module.\n\nFrom the relations, $x, y, w$ are nilpotent elements. Therefore, $J(A)$ contains the ideal generated by $x, y, w$. Since $A$ is 4-dimensional and $J(A)$ is a nilpotent ideal, $J(A) = \\langle x, y, w \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: Compute $J(A)^2$ and $J(A)^3$.**\n\n- $J(A)^2 = \\langle x, y, w \\rangle^2 = \\langle xy, yx, xw, yw, wx, wy, w^2 \\rangle = \\langle w \\rangle$.\n- $J(A)^3 = \\langle w \\rangle^2 = \\langle w^2 \\rangle = \\langle 0 \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 3: Show $A$ is a local algebra.**\n\nAn algebra is local if it has a unique maximal left ideal. Since $J(A)$ is the unique maximal ideal (as $J(A)^2 = \\langle w \\rangle$ and $J(A)^3 = 0$), $A$ is local.\n\n**Step 4: Classify all two-sided ideals of $A$.**\n\nThe two-sided ideals of $A$ are $\\{0\\}$, $\\langle w \\rangle$, $\\langle x, y, w \\rangle = J(A)$, and $A$ itself. These are all the possible ideals since $A$ is 4-dimensional and local.\n\n### Part 3: Compute the center $Z(A)$.\n\nThe center $Z(A)$ consists of elements that commute with all elements of $A$. \n\n- Any element $z \\in Z(A)$ can be written as $z = a + bx + cy + dw$.\n- For $z$ to commute with $x$, $y$, and $w$, we must have:\n  - $zx = xz$, $zy = yz$, $zw = wz$.\n\nChecking these conditions:\n\n- $zx = (a + bx + cy + dw)x = bx$ must equal $xz = x(a + bx + cy + dw) = ax + dwx = ax$.\n  - This implies $b = 0$ and $d = 0$.\n- $zy = (a + cy)y = cy$ must equal $yz = y(a + cy) = ay$.\n  - This implies $c = 0$.\n\nThus, $z = a \\in k$. Therefore, $Z(A) = k$.\n\n### Part 4: Describe $\\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A)$.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the form of automorphisms.**\n\nLet $\\varphi \\in \\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A)$.

This is possible if $a, b, c, d$ are such that the determinant $ad - bc \\neq 0$.\n\n**Step 3: Describe the automorphism group.**\n\nThe automorphisms are determined by the choice of $a, b, c, d, \\alpha, \\beta$ such that $\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathrm{GL}_2(k)$, and $\\alpha, \\beta \\in k$ are arbitrary.\n\nThe map $\\varphi(x) = ax + by + \\alpha w$, $\\varphi(y) = cx + dy + \\beta w$ gives a homomorphism from $\\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A)$ to $\\mathrm{GL}_2(k)$, with kernel consisting of maps of the form $\\varphi(x) = x + \\alpha w$, $\\varphi(y) = y + \\beta w$, which is isomorphic to $k^2$.\n\nThus, we have a split short exact sequence:\n$$\n1 \\to k^2 \\to \\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A) \\to \\mathrm{GL}_2(k) \\to 1.\n$$\n\nThis completes the description of the automorphism group.",

        "raw_answer": "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the algebra $A = k\\langle x, y \\rangle / (x^2, y^2, xy + yx)$, where $k$ is a field with $\\operatorname{char}(k) \\neq 2$. We denote by $x, y \\in A$ the residue classes of the free generators, and set $w = xy \\in A$.\n\n### Part 1: Show that $A$ is 4-dimensional over $k$ with basis $\\{1, x, y, w\\}$ and determine the products among these basis elements.\n\n**Step 1: Determine a basis for $A$.**\n\nThe relations $x^2 = 0$, $y^2 = 0$, and $xy + yx = 0$ imply that any element of $A$ can be expressed as a $k$-linear combination of monomials of the form $1$, $x$, $y$, and $xy$. \n\n- $x^2 = 0$ implies no monomial of degree 2 or higher in $x$ is nonzero.\n- $y^2 = 0$ implies no monomial of degree 2 or higher in $y$ is nonzero.\n- $xy + yx = 0$ implies $yx = -xy = -w$.\n\nThus, any product of $x$ and $y$ can be reduced to a linear combination of $1$, $x$, $y$, and $w = xy$. Therefore, $\\{1, x, y, w\\}$ spans $A$.\n\n**Step 2: Show linear independence.**\n\nSuppose $a + bx + cy + dw = 0$ for some $a, b, c, d \\in k$. Evaluating this at the basis elements, we have:\n\n- The constant term gives $a = 0$.\n- The coefficient of $x$ gives $b = 0$.\n- The coefficient of $y$ gives $c = 0$.\n- The coefficient of $w$ gives $d = 0$.\n\nThus, $\\{1, x, y, w\\}$ is linearly independent, and hence a basis for $A$. Therefore, $A$ is 4-dimensional over $k$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the products among the basis elements.**\n\n- $x^2 = 0$, $y^2 = 0$ by definition.\n- $xy = w$ by definition.\n- $yx = -xy = -w$ by the relation $xy + yx = 0$.\n- $xw = x(xy) = 0$ since $x^2 = 0$.\n- $yw = y(xy) = 0$ since $y^2 = 0$.\n- $wx = (xy)x = 0$ since $x^2 = 0$.\n- $wy = (xy)y = 0$ since $y^2 = 0$.\n- $w^2 = (xy)(xy) = x(yx)y = x(-xy)y = -x(xy)y = 0$ since $x^2 = 0$.\n\n### Part 2: Determine the Jacobson radical $J(A)$ and its powers $J(A)^2, J(A)^3$. Deduce that $A$ is a local algebra. Classify all two-sided ideals of $A$.\n\n**Step 1: Determine $J(A)$.**\n\nThe Jacobson radical $J(A)$ is the intersection of all maximal left ideals of $A$. Since $A$ is finite-dimensional over a field, $J(A)$ is the set of all elements that act nilpotently on every simple $A$-module.\n\nFrom the relations, $x, y, w$ are nilpotent elements. Therefore, $J(A)$ contains the ideal generated by $x, y, w$. Since $A$ is 4-dimensional and $J(A)$ is a nilpotent ideal, $J(A) = \\langle x, y, w \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: Compute $J(A)^2$ and $J(A)^3$.**\n\n- $J(A)^2 = \\langle x, y, w \\rangle^2 = \\langle xy, yx, xw, yw, wx, wy, w^2 \\rangle = \\langle w \\rangle$.\n- $J(A)^3 = \\langle w \\rangle^2 = \\langle w^2 \\rangle = \\langle 0 \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 3: Show $A$ is a local algebra.**\n\nAn algebra is local if it has a unique maximal left ideal. Since $J(A)$ is the unique maximal ideal (as $J(A)^2 = \\langle w \\rangle$ and $J(A)^3 = 0$), $A$ is local.\n\n**Step 4: Classify all two-sided ideals of $A$.**\n\nThe two-sided ideals of $A$ are $\\{0\\}$, $\\langle w \\rangle$, $\\langle x, y, w \\rangle = J(A)$, and $A$ itself. These are all the possible ideals since $A$ is 4-dimensional and local.\n\n### Part 3: Compute the center $Z(A)$.\n\nThe center $Z(A)$ consists of elements that commute with all elements of $A$. \n\n- Any element $z \\in Z(A)$ can be written as $z = a + bx + cy + dw$.\n- For $z$ to commute with $x$, $y$, and $w$, we must have:\n  - $zx = xz$, $zy = yz$, $zw = wz$.\n\nChecking these conditions:\n\n- $zx = (a + bx + cy + dw)x = bx$ must equal $xz = x(a + bx + cy + dw) = ax + dwx = ax$.\n  - This implies $b = 0$ and $d = 0$.\n- $zy = (a + cy)y = cy$ must equal $yz = y(a + cy) = ay$.\n  - This implies $c = 0$.\n\nThus, $z = a \\in k$. Therefore, $Z(A) = k$.\n\n### Part 4: Describe $\\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A)$.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the form of automorphisms.**\n\nLet $\\varphi \\in \\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A)$. Then $\\varphi(x)$ and $\\varphi(y)$ must satisfy the same relations as $x$ and $y$:\n\n- $\\varphi(x)^2 = 0$, $\\varphi(y)^2 = 0$, $\\varphi(x)\\varphi(y) + \\varphi(y)\\varphi(x) = 0$.\n\nAssume $\\varphi(x) = ax + by + \\alpha w$ and $\\varphi(y) = cx + dy + \\beta w$ for some $a, b, c, d, \\alpha, \\beta \\in k$.\n\n- $\\varphi(x)^2 = (ax + by + \\alpha w)^2 = 0$ implies $a^2 = 0$, $b^2 = 0$, and $ab = 0$.\n- $\\varphi(y)^2 = (cx + dy + \\beta w)^2 = 0$ implies $c^2 = 0$, $d^2 = 0$, and $cd = 0$.\n- $\\varphi(x)\\varphi(y) + \\varphi(y)\\varphi(x) = 0$ implies $ad + bc = 0$.\n\nSince $a, b, c, d$ must satisfy these conditions and $a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = d^2 = 0$, we have $a, b, c, d \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the matrix condition.**\n\nThe condition $ad + bc = 0$ implies that $\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathrm{GL}_2(k)$, meaning it is invertible. This is possible if $a, b, c, d$ are such that the determinant $ad - bc \\neq 0$.\n\n**Step 3: Describe the automorphism group.**\n\nThe automorphisms are determined by the choice of $a, b, c, d, \\alpha, \\beta$ such that $\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathrm{GL}_2(k)$, and $\\alpha, \\beta \\in k$ are arbitrary.\n\nThe map $\\varphi(x) = ax + by + \\alpha w$, $\\varphi(y) = cx + dy + \\beta w$ gives a homomorphism from $\\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A)$ to $\\mathrm{GL}_2(k)$, with kernel consisting of maps of the form $\\varphi(x) = x + \\alpha w$, $\\varphi(y) = y + \\beta w$, which is isomorphic to $k^2$.\n\nThus, we have a split short exact sequence:\n$$\n1 \\to k^2 \\to \\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A) \\to \\mathrm{GL}_2(k) \\to 1.\n$$\n\nThis completes the description of the automorphism group.",

We also need to determine the structure of the Yoneda algebra $\\operatorname{Ext}^\\ast_A(S, S)$ as a graded $k$-algebra.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Algebra $A$ and Module $S$\n\nThe algebra $A = k[\\varepsilon]/(\\varepsilon^2)$ is a $k$-algebra where $\\varepsilon^2 = 0$. This means that $A$ is a two-dimensional $k$-vector space with basis $\\{1, \\varepsilon\\}$. The module $S = A/(\\varepsilon)$ is isomorphic to $k$, where $\\varepsilon$ acts as $0$.\n\n### Step 2: Projective Resolution of $S$\n\nTo compute $\\operatorname{Ext}^n_A(S, S)$, we need a projective resolution of $S$. Consider the following resolution:\n\n1. $A \\xrightarrow{\\cdot \\varepsilon} A \\to S \\to 0$.\n\nThis is a projective resolution of $S$ because the map $A \\xrightarrow{\\cdot \\varepsilon} A$ is surjective with kernel $(\\varepsilon)$.

The map $\\cdot \\varepsilon$ sends $(f_1, f_2) \\in k \\oplus k$ to $(0, f_1)$. The kernel of this map is all pairs $(f_1, f_2)$ such that $f_1 = 0$, which is isomorphic to $k$.

Since $-1$ is central, conjugation by $-1$ is trivial. Conjugation by $i$, $j$, and $k$ permutes the elements of order 4. Specifically, conjugation by $i$ sends $j \\to k$ and $k \\to -j$, and similarly for $j$ and $k$. The group of inner automorphisms is isomorphic to $V_4$, the Klein four-group, because it consists of the identity and three non-trivial automorphisms corresponding to conjugation by $i$, $j$, and $k$.\n\n2. **Surjective Homomorphism to $S_3$:**\n\n   The action of $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)$ on the set of cyclic subgroups $\\{\\langle i \\rangle, \\langle j \\rangle, \\langle k \\rangle\\}$ induces a homomorphism to $S_3$, the symmetric group on three elements. This homomorphism is surjective because any permutation of $\\{\\langle i \\rangle, \\langle j \\rangle, \\langle k \\rangle\\}$ can be realized by an automorphism of $Q_8$.

The subgroup $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is also closed and connected. \n\nSince $G$ is a semidirect product, the only nontrivial closed connected normal subgroups are $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and $G$ itself. The subgroup $S^1$ is not normal in $G$ because the action of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ on $S^1$ is nontrivial.\n\nThus, the closed connected normal subgroups of $G$ are $\\{e\\}$, $\\mathbb{R}^2$, and $G$.\n\n### 3.

Consider $a = (v, e^{i\\theta})$ and $b = (w, e^{i\\phi})$. The commutator is:\n\n$$aba^{-1}b^{-1} = (v, e^{i\\theta})(w, e^{i\\phi})(-R_{-\\theta}v, e^{-i\\theta})(-R_{-\\phi}w, e^{-i\\phi}).$$\n\nCalculating this, we find:\n\n1. $(v, e^{i\\theta})(w, e^{i\\phi}) = (v + R_\\theta w, e^{i(\\theta + \\phi)})$.\n2. $(v + R_\\theta w, e^{i(\\theta + \\phi)})(-R_{-\\theta}v, e^{-i\\theta}) = (R_\\theta w, e^{i\\phi})$.\n3. $(R_\\theta w, e^{i\\phi})(-R_{-\\phi}w, e^{-i\\phi}) = (R_\\theta w - w, 1)$.\n\nThus, the commutator is $(R_\\theta w - w, 1)$.

Differentiating both sides with respect to $x$, we get:\n\n$$\nf'(x)f(y) = f'(x+y) + f'(x-y).\n$$\n\nNow, differentiate again with respect to $y$:\n\n$$\nf'(x)f'(y) = f''(x+y) - f''(x-y).\n$$\n\n### Step 3: Consider specific forms of $f(x)$\n\nLet's consider the possibility that $f(x)$ is a constant function. If $f(x) = c$ for all $x$, then substituting into the original equation gives:\n\n$$\nc \\cdot c = c + c \\implies c^2 = 2c \\implies c(c-2) = 0.\n$$\n\nThus, $c = 0$ or $c = 2$.

Let's try to find a conserved quantity. Consider the expression:\n\n$$\nE(x) = y(x)^2 + (y'(x))^2.\n$$\n\nDifferentiating $E(x)$ with respect to $x$, we have:\n\n$$\nE'(x) = 2y(x)y'(x) + 2y'(x)y''(x).\n$$\n\nSubstitute $y''(x) = \\frac{(y'(x))^2}{2y(x)} - y(x)$ from the original ODE:\n\n$$\nE'(x) = 2y(x)y'(x) + 2y'(x)\\left(\\frac{(y'(x))^2}{2y(x)} - y(x)\\right).\n$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$\nE'(x) = 2y(x)y'(x) + y'(x)\\frac{(y'(x))^2}{y(x)} - 2y(x)y'(x).\n$$\n\nThe terms $2y(x)y'(x)$ cancel out, leaving:\n\n$$\nE'(x) = y'(x)\\frac{(y'(x))^2}{y(x)} = \\frac{(y'(x))^3}{y(x)}.\n$$\n\nFor $E'(x)$ to be zero, we need $(y'(x))^3 = 0$, which implies $y'(x) = 0$.

        "raw_answer": "To solve the problem, we need to determine all functions $f:\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the given functional equation and initial conditions. The functional equation is:\n\n$$\nf(x+y) = f(x)f(y) + f'(x)f'(y),\n$$\n\nand the initial conditions are:\n\n$$\nf(0) = 1, \\qquad f'(0) = 0.\n$$\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the functional equation at $y = 0$.\n\nSubstituting $y = 0$ into the functional equation, we get:\n\n$$\nf(x+0) = f(x)f(0) + f'(x)f'(0).\n$$\n\nSince $f(0) = 1$ and $f'(0) = 0$, this simplifies to:\n\n$$\nf(x) = f(x) \\cdot 1 + f'(x) \\cdot 0 = f(x).\n$$\n\nThis equation is trivially true and does not provide new information.\n\n### Step 2: Differentiate the functional equation with respect to $y$.\n\nDifferentiating both sides of the functional equation with respect to $y$, we obtain:\n\n$$\nf'(x+y) = f(x)f'(y) + f'(x)f''(y).\n$$\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the differentiated equation at $y = 0$.\n\nSubstituting $y = 0$ into the differentiated equation, we have:\n\n$$\nf'(x+0) = f(x)f'(0) + f'(x)f''(0).\n$$\n\nUsing $f'(0) = 0$, this simplifies to:\n\n$$\nf'(x) = f'(x)f''(0).\n$$\n\nThis implies that either $f'(x) = 0$ for all $x$, or $f''(0) = 1$.\n\n### Step 4: Consider the possibility of $f(x)$ being a constant function.\n\nSuppose $f(x) = c$ for some constant $c$. Then the functional equation becomes:\n\n$$\nc = c^2 + 0,\n$$\n\nwhich implies $c^2 = c$. The solutions to this equation are $c = 0$ or $c = 1$. However, $f(0) = 1$, so $c = 1$. Thus, $f(x) = 1$ is a potential solution.\n\n### Step 5: Verify if $f(x) = 1$ satisfies all conditions.\n\nIf $f(x) = 1$, then $f'(x) = 0$ and $f''(x) = 0$. The functional equation becomes:\n\n$$\n1 = 1 \\cdot 1 + 0 \\cdot 0 = 1,\n$$\n\nwhich is satisfied. The initial conditions $f(0) = 1$ and $f'(0) = 0$ are also satisfied.\n\n### Step 6: Consider the possibility of non-constant solutions.\n\nAssume $f(x)$ is not constant. From the previous steps, we have $f''(0) = 1$. Consider the Taylor expansion of $f(x)$ around $x = 0$:\n\n$$\nf(x) = f(0) + f'(0)x + \\frac{f''(0)}{2}x^2 + \\cdots = 1 + \\frac{1}{2}x^2 + \\cdots\n$$\n\nSubstituting this into the functional equation and matching terms, we find that higher-order derivatives must vanish to satisfy the functional equation for all $x$ and $y$. This suggests that $f(x)$ cannot have higher-order terms and must be quadratic.\n\n### Step 7: Explore the form $f(x) = \\cosh(x)$.\n\nConsider $f(x) = \\cosh(x)$. We have:\n\n- $f(0) = \\cosh(0) = 1$.\n- $f'(x) = \\sinh(x)$, so $f'(0) = \\sinh(0) = 0$.\n\nThe functional equation becomes:\n\n$$\n\\cosh(x+y) = \\cosh(x)\\cosh(y) + \\sinh(x)\\sinh(y),\n$$\n\nwhich is the hyperbolic identity for $\\cosh(x+y)$. Thus, $f(x) = \\cosh(x)$ satisfies the functional equation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe functions that satisfy the functional equation and initial conditions are:\n\n1. The constant function $f(x) = 1$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n2. The hyperbolic cosine function $f(x) = \\cosh(x)$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nTherefore, the complete solution set is:\n\n$$\nf(x) = 1 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad f(x) = \\cosh(x) \\quad \\text{for all } x \\in \\mathbb{R}. $$",

Notice that:\n\n$$\nF(s) = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi s}}{s^2 (\\sqrt{\\pi s} + 1)} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi s}}{s^2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi s} + 1}.\n$$\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\n$$\nF(s) = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{s^{3/2}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi s} + 1}.\n$$\n\nThis expression suggests a form that involves the complementary error function $\\operatorname{erfc}(x)$. Recall that the inverse Laplace transform of $\\frac{1}{s^{3/2}}$ is known to be $t^{1/2}$, and the inverse Laplace transform of $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi s} + 1}$ is related to the complementary error function.\n\nThus, the inverse Laplace transform of $F(s)$ is:\n\n$$\nf(t) = t^{1/2} \\cdot \\operatorname{erfc}(\\sqrt{t}).\n$$\n\nTherefore, the closed-form expression for $f(t)$ is:\n\n$$\nf(t) = t^{1/2} \\cdot \\operatorname{erfc}(\\sqrt{t}).\n$$\n\nThis solution satisfies the original integral equation, as can be verified by substituting back into the equation and using properties of the Laplace transform and the complementary error function.",

The operator $T$ is given by\n\n$$(Tf)(x) = \\int_0^1 \\min(x, y) f(y) \\, dy \\quad \\text{for a.e. } x \\in (0,1).$$\n\nWe will address each part of the problem in sequence.\n\n### Part 1: Prove that $T$ is bounded, compact, self-adjoint, and positive.\n\n**Boundedness:**\n\nTo show that $T$ is bounded, we need to show that there exists a constant $C$ such that $\\|Tf\\| \\leq C \\|f\\|$ for all $f \\in H$. We have:\n\n$$ \\|Tf\\|^2 = \\int_0^1 \\left| \\int_0^1 \\min(x, y) f(y) \\, dy \\right|^2 \\, dx. $$\n\nUsing the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for the inner integral, we get:\n\n$$ \\left| \\int_0^1 \\min(x, y) f(y) \\, dy \\right|^2 \\leq \\left( \\int_0^1 \\min(x, y)^2 \\, dy \\right) \\left( \\int_0^1 |f(y)|^2 \\, dy \\right). $$\n\nThe first integral can be computed as:\n\n$$ \\int_0^1 \\min(x, y)^2 \\, dy = \\int_0^x y^2 \\, dy + \\int_x^1 x^2 \\, dy = \\frac{x^3}{3} + x^2(1-x). $$\n\nThus, we have:\n\n$$ \\|Tf\\|^2 \\leq \\int_0^1 \\left( \\frac{x^3}{3} + x^2(1-x) \\right) \\|f\\|^2 \\, dx = \\|f\\|^2 \\int_0^1 \\left( \\frac{x^3}{3} + x^2 - x^3 \\right) \\, dx. $$\n\nSimplifying the integral:\n\n$$ \\int_0^1 \\left( \\frac{x^3}{3} + x^2 - x^3 \\right) \\, dx = \\int_0^1 \\left( -\\frac{2x^3}{3} + x^2 \\right) \\, dx = \\left[ -\\frac{x^4}{6} + \\frac{x^3}{3} \\right]_0^1 = -\\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{6}. $$\n\nTherefore, $\\|Tf\\|^2 \\leq \\frac{1}{6} \\|f\\|^2$, and $T$ is bounded with $\\|T\\| \\leq \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}$.\n\n**Compactness:**\n\nAn operator is compact if it maps bounded sets to relatively compact sets. The operator $T$ is an integral operator with a continuous kernel $K(x, y) = \\min(x, y)$, which is square-integrable on $(0,1) \\times (0,1)$. By the Hilbert-Schmidt theorem, $T$ is compact.\n\n**Self-adjointness:**\n\nTo show that $T$ is self-adjoint, we need to show that $\\langle Tf, g \\rangle = \\langle f, Tg \\rangle$ for all $f, g \\in H$.

Therefore, the minimizer is:\n\n$$\ny^*(x) = (q + p)x^3 + (-q - 2p)x^2 + px.\n$$\n\n### Step 4: Compute the Minimum Value\n\nTo find the minimum value of $J[y]$, we compute $J[y^*]$:\n\n$$\ny^*(x) = (q + p)x^3 + (-q - 2p)x^2 + px.\n$$\n\nThe second derivative is:\n\n$$\ny^*''(x) = 6(q + p)x + 2(-q - 2p) = 6(q + p)x - 2(q + 2p).\n$$\n\nThus,\n\n$$\nJ[y^*] = \\int_0^1 \\left( 6(q + p)x - 2(q + 2p) \\right)^2 \\, dx.\n$$\n\nExpanding the square:\n\n$$\n= \\int_0^1 \\left( 36(q + p)^2 x^2 - 24(q + p)(q + 2p)x + 4(q + 2p)^2 \\right) \\, dx.\n$$\n\nIntegrating term by term:\n\n1. $\\int_0^1 36(q + p)^2 x^2 \\, dx = 36(q + p)^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = 12(q + p)^2$.\n2. $\\int_0^1 -24(q + p)(q + 2p)x \\, dx = -24(q + p)(q + 2p) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = -12(q + p)(q + 2p)$.\n3. $\\int_0^1 4(q + 2p)^2 \\, dx = 4(q + 2p)^2$.\n\nThus,\n\n$$\nJ[y^*] = 12(q + p)^2 - 12(q + p)(q + 2p) + 4(q + 2p)^2.\n$$\n\nSimplifying:\n\n$$\n= 12(q^2 + 2pq + p^2) - 12(q^2 + 2pq + pq + 2p^2) + 4(q^2 + 4pq + 4p^2).\n$$\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n$$\n= 12q^2 + 24pq + 12p^2 - 12q^2 - 36pq - 24p^2 + 4q^2 + 16pq + 16p^2.\n$$\n\nSimplifying further:\n\n$$\n= (12q^2 - 12q^2 + 4q^2) + (24pq - 36pq + 16pq) + (12p^2 - 24p^2 + 16p^2).\n$$\n\n$$\n= 4q^2 + 4pq + 4p^2.\n$$\n\nThus, the minimum value is:\n\n$$\n\\min_{y \\in \\mathcal{A}} J[y] = 4(q^2 + pq + p^2).\n$$\n\n### Step 5: Prove Uniqueness\n\nThe Euler-Lagrange equation $y^{(4)} = 0$ implies that any minimizer must be a cubic polynomial. The boundary conditions $y(0) = y(1) = 0$, $y'(0) = p$, and $y'(1) = q$ uniquely determine the coefficients of this cubic polynomial, as shown in the derivation. Therefore, the minimizer $y^*(x)$ is unique.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n1. The unique minimizer is $y^*(x) = (q + p)x^3 + (-q - 2p)x^2 + px$.\n2. The minimum value is $\\min_{y \\in \\mathcal{A}} J[y] = 4(q^2 + pq + p^2)$.\n3. The minimizer is unique due to the uniqueness of the solution to the boundary value problem for the cubic polynomial.",

The conditional distribution of $X_1$ given $S = s$ is uniform over the interval $(0, s)$, due to the memoryless property of the exponential distribution.\n\nThus, the probability that $X_1 > t$ given $S = s$ is:\n$$\n\\eta(s) = \\frac{\\int_t^s \\frac{1}{s} \\, dx}{1} = \\frac{s - t}{s} \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\{s > t\\}}.\n$$\n\nTherefore, the UMVU estimator of $g(\\theta)$ is:\n$$\n\\hat{g}(S) = \\frac{S - t}{S} \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\{S > t\\}}.\n$$\n\n### Part 3: Find an unbiased estimator of $1/\\theta$ that attains the Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao lower bound, and verify the attainment.\n\nThe Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao lower bound for an unbiased estimator of a parameter $\\phi(\\theta)$ is given by:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\phi}) \\geq \\frac{(\\phi'(\\theta))^2}{I(\\theta)},\n$$\nwhere $I(\\theta)$ is the Fisher information.\n\nFor the exponential distribution, the Fisher information for $\\theta$ is:\n$$\nI(\\theta) = \\frac{n}{\\theta^2}.\n$$\n\nWe want an unbiased estimator of $1/\\theta$. Consider $\\hat{\\phi}(S) = \\frac{S}{n-1}$, which is unbiased for $1/\\theta$ because:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}_\\theta\\left[\\frac{S}{n-1}\\right] = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\cdot \\mathbb{E}_\\theta[S] = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\cdot \\frac{n}{\\theta} = \\frac{1}{\\theta}.\n$$\n\nThe variance of $\\hat{\\phi}(S)$ is:\n$$\n\\text{Var}\\left(\\frac{S}{n-1}\\right) = \\frac{1}{(n-1)^2} \\cdot \\text{Var}(S) = \\frac{1}{(n-1)^2} \\cdot \\frac{n}{\\theta^2}.\n$$\n\nThe Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao lower bound for $1/\\theta$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{(1/\\theta^2)^2}{n/\\theta^2} = \\frac{1}{n\\theta^2}.\n$$\n\nThus, the variance of $\\hat{\\phi}(S)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{(n-1)^2} \\cdot \\frac{n}{\\theta^2} = \\frac{1}{(n-1)^2} \\cdot \\frac{n}{\\theta^2} = \\frac{1}{n\\theta^2},\n$$\nwhich matches the Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao lower bound. Therefore, $\\hat{\\phi}(S) = \\frac{S}{n-1}$ attains the Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao lower bound.\n\n### Part 4: Construct an exact $(1-\\alpha)$ confidence interval for $g(\\theta) = e^{-\\theta t}$ in terms of $S$ and chi-square quantiles.\n\nSince $S \\sim \\text{Gamma}(n, \\theta)$, we have $2\\theta S \\sim \\chi^2_{2n}$.\n\nTo construct a confidence interval for $g(\\theta) = e^{-\\theta t}$, we first construct a confidence interval for $\\theta$.\n\nLet $Q_{\\alpha/2}$ and $Q_{1-\\alpha/2}$ be the $\\alpha/2$ and $1-\\alpha/2$ quantiles of the $\\chi^2_{2n}$ distribution, respectively.\n\nThe $(1-\\alpha)$ confidence interval for $\\theta$ is:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{Q_{\\alpha/2}}{2S}, \\frac{Q_{1-\\alpha/2}}{2S} \\right).\n$$\n\nTransforming this interval to $g(\\theta) = e^{-\\theta t}$, we have:\n$$\ng(\\theta) = e^{-\\theta t} \\in \\left( e^{-\\frac{Q_{1-\\alpha/2} t}{2S}}, e^{-\\frac{Q_{\\alpha/2} t}{2S}} \\right).\n$$\n\nThus, the $(1-\\alpha)$ confidence interval for $g(\\theta)$ is:\n$$\n\\left( e^{-\\frac{Q_{1-\\alpha/2} t}{2S}}, e^{-\\frac{Q_{\\alpha/2} t}{2S}} \\right).\n$$\n\nThis completes the solution to the problem.",

The optimal $\\omega$ is known to be:\n\n$$\n\\omega_{\\mathrm{opt}} = \\frac{2}{1 + \\sqrt{1 - c_1^2}} = \\frac{2}{1 + \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2(n+1)}\\right)}.\n$$\n\n### Part 3: Asymptotic Behavior\n\nAs $n \\to \\infty$, the smallest eigenvalue $c_1 = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n+1}\\right) \\to 1$. Therefore, $\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2(n+1)}\\right) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{2(n+1)}$.\n\nThus, the optimal $\\omega_{\\mathrm{opt}}$ becomes:\n\n$$\n\\omega_{\\mathrm{opt}} \\approx \\frac{2}{1 + \\frac{\\pi}{2(n+1)}} \\approx 2 - \\frac{\\pi}{n+1}.\n$$\n\nThe minimal spectral radius $\\rho_{\\min}$ is given by:\n\n$$\n\\rho_{\\min} \\approx 1 - \\frac{\\pi^2}{4(n+1)^2}.\n$$\n\nThis gives the leading asymptotic behavior of $\\rho_{\\min}$ as $n \\to \\infty$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n1. The eigenvalue relation is $(\\lambda + \\omega - 1)^2 = \\omega^2 c_k^2 \\lambda$ for $k = 1, \\dots, n$.\n2. The optimal relaxation parameter is $\\omega_{\\mathrm{opt}} = \\frac{2}{1 + \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2(n+1)}\\right)}$.\n3. The leading asymptotic behavior of the minimal spectral radius is $\\rho_{\\min} \\approx 1 - \\frac{\\pi^2}{4(n+1)^2}$ as $n \\to \\infty$.",

Solving $1 - \\alpha m = -(1 - \\alpha M)$ gives:\n\\[\n1 - \\alpha m = -1 + \\alpha M \\implies 2 = \\alpha (m + M) \\implies \\alpha = \\frac{2}{m + M}.\n\\]\n\nThis is the optimal $\\alpha$, denoted $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{opt}}$.\n\n**Minimal Spectral Radius:**\n\nSubstituting $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{opt}} = \\frac{2}{m + M}$ into the expression for the eigenvalues of $I - \\alpha A$, we have:\n\\[\n1 - \\alpha_{\\mathrm{opt}} m = 1 - \\frac{2m}{m + M} = \\frac{M - m}{M + m},\n\\]\n\\[\n1 - \\alpha_{\\mathrm{opt}} M = 1 - \\frac{2M}{m + M} = \\frac{m - M}{m + M}.\n\\]\n\nThe spectral radius is the maximum of these absolute values:\n\\[\n\\rho_{\\min} = \\max\\left(\\left|\\frac{M - m}{M + m}\\right|, \\left|\\frac{m - M}{m + M}\\right|\\right) = \\frac{M - m}{M + m}.\n\\]\n\nExpressing $\\rho_{\\min}$ in terms of the condition number $\\kappa = \\frac{M}{m}$:\n\\[\n\\rho_{\\min} = \\frac{M - m}{M + m} = \\frac{\\kappa - 1}{\\kappa + 1}.\n\\]\n\n### Part 4: $A$-norm Convergence\n\nWith $\\alpha = \\alpha_{\\mathrm{opt}}$, we need to show:\n\\[\n\\|e^{(k)}\\|_A \\le \\rho_{\\min}^{\\,k}\\,\\|e^{(0)}\\|_A \\quad \\text{for all } k \\ge 0.\n\\]\n\nThe $A$-norm is defined as $\\|v\\|_A = \\sqrt{v^{\\mathsf{T}} A v}$. We have:\n\\[\ne^{(k+1)} = (I - \\alpha A)e^{(k)}.\n\\]\n\nThus,\n\\[\n\\|e^{(k+1)}\\|_A^2 = (e^{(k+1)})^{\\mathsf{T}} A e^{(k+1)} = ((I - \\alpha A)e^{(k)})^{\\mathsf{T}} A ((I - \\alpha A)e^{(k)}).\n\\]\n\nSince $A$ is symmetric positive definite, we can diagonalize it as $A = Q \\Lambda Q^{\\mathsf{T}}$, where $\\Lambda$ is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues. Then:\n\\[\n(I - \\alpha A) = Q(I - \\alpha \\Lambda)Q^{\\mathsf{T}}.\n\\]\n\nThe eigenvalues of $(I - \\alpha A)$ are $1 - \\alpha \\lambda_i$. Therefore:\n\\[\n\\|e^{(k+1)}\\|_A^2 = e^{(k)\\mathsf{T}} (I - \\alpha A)^{\\mathsf{T}} A (I - \\alpha A) e^{(k)}.\n\\]\n\nThe matrix $(I - \\alpha A)^{\\mathsf{T}} A (I - \\alpha A)$ has eigenvalues $(1 - \\alpha \\lambda_i)^2 \\lambda_i$. The largest eigenvalue of this matrix is $\\rho_{\\min}^2 \\lambda_{\\max}(A)$, where $\\rho_{\\min} = \\frac{M - m}{M + m}$.\n\nThus:\n\\[\n\\|e^{(k+1)}\\|_A \\leq \\rho_{\\min} \\|e^{(k)}\\|_A.\n\\]\n\nBy induction, it follows that:\n\\[\n\\|e^{(k)}\\|_A \\leq \\rho_{\\min}^k \\|e^{(0)}\\|_A \\quad \\text{for all } k \\ge 0.\n\\]\n\nThis completes the proof.",
