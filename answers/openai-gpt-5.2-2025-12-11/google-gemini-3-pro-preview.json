        "answer": "To determine the number of distinct admissible colorings up to dihedral symmetry, we will use Burnside's Lemma (also known as the Cauchy-Frobenius Lemma).\n\n### 1. Problem Setup\n\nLet $X$ be the set of all admissible colorings of the necklace with fixed positions labeled $1$ to $10$.\nThe necklace has $n=10$ beads. We color $k=4$ beads black and $n-k=6$ beads white.\nThe admissibility condition states that no two black beads can be adjacent.\n\nFirst, we calculate the size of $X$, denoted $|X|$. The number of ways to arrange $k$ black beads and $n-k$ white beads on a circle of size $n$ such that no two black beads are adjacent is given by the Kaplansky formula for circular arrangements:\n$$ |X| = \\frac{n}{n-k} \\binom{n-k}{k} $$\nSubstituting $n=10$ and $k=4$:\n$$ |X| = \\frac{10}{10-4} \\binom{10-4}{4} = \\frac{10}{6} \\binom{6}{4} = \\frac{5}{3} \\times 15 = 25 $$\nSo, there are 25 admissible colorings in fixed positions.\n\nThe group acting on the necklace is the Dihedral group $D_{10}$, which represents the symmetries of a regular decagon. The order of the group is $|D_{10}| = 2n = 20$. The elements of $D_{10}$ consist of:\n- 10 rotations (including the identity).\n- 10 reflections.\n\nBy Burnside's Lemma, the number of distinct colorings $N$ (orbits) is:\n$$ N = \\frac{1}{|G|} \\sum_{g \\in G} |X^g| $$\nwhere $|X^g|$ is the number of colorings fixed by the group element $g$.\n\n### 2. Analyzing Fixed Points for Each Group Element\n\nWe categorize the 20 elements of $D_{10}$ and compute $|X^g|$ for each type.\n\n#### A. Identity ($R_0$)\nThe identity rotation fixes all elements in $X$.\n$$ |X^{R_0}| = 25 $$\n\n#### B. Rotations ($R_1, \\dots, R_9$)\nLet $R_i$ be the rotation by $360 \\cdot \\frac{i}{10}$ degrees. A coloring is fixed by $R_i$ if the black beads are union of disjoint cycles of the permutation induced by $R_i$. Specifically, if the cycle structure consists of $d$ cycles of length $L$, we must be able to choose some number of full cycles to reach exactly $k=4$ black beads. Thus, $L$ must divide $k$.\n\n1.  **Rotations of order 10 ($R_1, R_3, R_7, R_9$)**:\n    The cycle length is $L=10$. Since $10$ does not divide $4$, no valid coloring can be fixed.\n    $$ |X^g| = 0 $$\n\n2.  **Rotations of order 5 ($R_2, R_4, R_6, R_8$)**:\n    The cycle length is $L=5$. Since $5$ does not divide $4$, no valid coloring can be fixed.\n    $$ |X^g| = 0 $$\n\n3.  **Rotation of order 2 ($R_5$)**:\n    The cycle length is $L=10/\\gcd(5,10) = 2$. There are 5 cycles of length 2: $(1,6), (2,7), (3,8), (4,9), (5,10)$.\n    Since $2$ divides $4$, we must choose $4/2 = 2$ cycles to be black.\n    We need to choose 2 cycles from the 5 such that no two beads in the chosen cycles are adjacent in the original necklace.\n    Two cycles $C_i$ and $C_j$ are \"adjacent\" if any bead in $C_i$ is adjacent to any bead in $C_j$.\n    The cycles themselves are arranged in a circular order $C_1-C_2-C_3-C_4-C_5-C_1$ where adjacent indices correspond to adjacent beads (e.g., beads 1 and 6 in $C_1$ are adjacent to beads in $C_2$ and $C_5$).\n    Thus, we must choose 2 non-adjacent cycles from 5 arranged in a circle.\n    Using the circular combination formula for $n'=5, k'=2$:\n    $$ \\text{Count} = \\frac{5}{5-2} \\binom{5-2}{2} = \\frac{5}{3} \\binom{3}{2} = 5 $$\n    $$ |X^{R_5}| = 5 $$\n\n#### C. Reflections\nThere are 10 reflections in two conjugacy classes for a 10-gon.\n\n1.  **Reflections through opposite vertices (5 elements)**:\n    The axis passes through two opposite beads (e.g., 1 and 6). This fixes 2 beads (length 1 cycles) and swaps 4 pairs of beads (length 2 cycles).\n    To obtain a fixed coloring with 4 black beads, we have two cases for the composition of black beads:\n    - **Case 1**: 0 fixed beads and 2 pairs.\n      The fixed beads (1 and 6) are white.

        "raw_answer": "To determine the number of distinct admissible colorings up to dihedral symmetry, we will use Burnside's Lemma (also known as the Cauchy-Frobenius Lemma).\n\n### 1. Problem Setup\n\nLet $X$ be the set of all admissible colorings of the necklace with fixed positions labeled $1$ to $10$.\nThe necklace has $n=10$ beads. We color $k=4$ beads black and $n-k=6$ beads white.\nThe admissibility condition states that no two black beads can be adjacent.\n\nFirst, we calculate the size of $X$, denoted $|X|$. The number of ways to arrange $k$ black beads and $n-k$ white beads on a circle of size $n$ such that no two black beads are adjacent is given by the Kaplansky formula for circular arrangements:\n$$ |X| = \\frac{n}{n-k} \\binom{n-k}{k} $$\nSubstituting $n=10$ and $k=4$:\n$$ |X| = \\frac{10}{10-4} \\binom{10-4}{4} = \\frac{10}{6} \\binom{6}{4} = \\frac{5}{3} \\times 15 = 25 $$\nSo, there are 25 admissible colorings in fixed positions.\n\nThe group acting on the necklace is the Dihedral group $D_{10}$, which represents the symmetries of a regular decagon. The order of the group is $|D_{10}| = 2n = 20$. The elements of $D_{10}$ consist of:\n- 10 rotations (including the identity).\n- 10 reflections.\n\nBy Burnside's Lemma, the number of distinct colorings $N$ (orbits) is:\n$$ N = \\frac{1}{|G|} \\sum_{g \\in G} |X^g| $$\nwhere $|X^g|$ is the number of colorings fixed by the group element $g$.\n\n### 2. Analyzing Fixed Points for Each Group Element\n\nWe categorize the 20 elements of $D_{10}$ and compute $|X^g|$ for each type.\n\n#### A. Identity ($R_0$)\nThe identity rotation fixes all elements in $X$.\n$$ |X^{R_0}| = 25 $$\n\n#### B. Rotations ($R_1, \\dots, R_9$)\nLet $R_i$ be the rotation by $360 \\cdot \\frac{i}{10}$ degrees. A coloring is fixed by $R_i$ if the black beads are union of disjoint cycles of the permutation induced by $R_i$. Specifically, if the cycle structure consists of $d$ cycles of length $L$, we must be able to choose some number of full cycles to reach exactly $k=4$ black beads. Thus, $L$ must divide $k$.\n\n1.  **Rotations of order 10 ($R_1, R_3, R_7, R_9$)**:\n    The cycle length is $L=10$. Since $10$ does not divide $4$, no valid coloring can be fixed.\n    $$ |X^g| = 0 $$\n\n2.  **Rotations of order 5 ($R_2, R_4, R_6, R_8$)**:\n    The cycle length is $L=5$. Since $5$ does not divide $4$, no valid coloring can be fixed.\n    $$ |X^g| = 0 $$\n\n3.  **Rotation of order 2 ($R_5$)**:\n    The cycle length is $L=10/\\gcd(5,10) = 2$. There are 5 cycles of length 2: $(1,6), (2,7), (3,8), (4,9), (5,10)$.\n    Since $2$ divides $4$, we must choose $4/2 = 2$ cycles to be black.\n    We need to choose 2 cycles from the 5 such that no two beads in the chosen cycles are adjacent in the original necklace.\n    Two cycles $C_i$ and $C_j$ are \"adjacent\" if any bead in $C_i$ is adjacent to any bead in $C_j$.\n    The cycles themselves are arranged in a circular order $C_1-C_2-C_3-C_4-C_5-C_1$ where adjacent indices correspond to adjacent beads (e.g., beads 1 and 6 in $C_1$ are adjacent to beads in $C_2$ and $C_5$).\n    Thus, we must choose 2 non-adjacent cycles from 5 arranged in a circle.\n    Using the circular combination formula for $n'=5, k'=2$:\n    $$ \\text{Count} = \\frac{5}{5-2} \\binom{5-2}{2} = \\frac{5}{3} \\binom{3}{2} = 5 $$\n    $$ |X^{R_5}| = 5 $$\n\n#### C. Reflections\nThere are 10 reflections in two conjugacy classes for a 10-gon.\n\n1.  **Reflections through opposite vertices (5 elements)**:\n    The axis passes through two opposite beads (e.g., 1 and 6). This fixes 2 beads (length 1 cycles) and swaps 4 pairs of beads (length 2 cycles).\n    To obtain a fixed coloring with 4 black beads, we have two cases for the composition of black beads:\n    - **Case 1**: 0 fixed beads and 2 pairs.\n      The fixed beads (1 and 6) are white. We must choose 2 pairs from the 4 swapping pairs. The 4 pairs form a linear chain $P_1-P_2-P_3-P_4$ regarding adjacency constraints. We need to choose 2 non-adjacent pairs.\n      Number of ways = $\\binom{4-2+1}{2} = \\binom{3}{2} = 3$.\n    - **Case 2**: 2 fixed beads and 1 pair.\n      The fixed beads (1 and 6) are black. Note that 1 and 6 are not adjacent. We must choose 1 pair from the 4 swapping pairs. However, the black beads at 1 and 6 make their neighbors ($2, 10, 5, 7$) unavailable. This eliminates the outer pairs $P_1$ (containing 2,10) and $P_4$ (containing 5,7). We must choose 1 pair from the remaining $\\{P_2, P_3\\}$. Both choices are valid.\n      Number of ways = 2.\n    \n    Total for each vertex reflection = $3 + 2 = 5$.\n    With 5 such reflections:\n    $$ \\sum |X^{\\sigma_v}| = 5 \\times 5 = 25 $$\n\n2.  **Reflections through edge midpoints (5 elements)**:\n    The axis passes through the midpoints of opposite edges (e.g., edge 1-2 and 6-7). This creates 5 cycles of length 2.\n    To get 4 black beads, we must select 2 cycles.\n    However, the cycles containing the beads on the edges intersected by the axis (e.g., cycle $\\{1,2\\}$ and cycle $\\{6,7\\}$) consist of adjacent beads.

Elements and Hasse Diagram of $\\operatorname{DM}(P)$\n\nThe Dedekind\u2013MacNeille completion $\\operatorname{DM}(P)$ consists of all subsets $A \\subseteq P$ such that $A = A^{ul}$. These sets are often called **cuts** or **closed sets** in the context of the closure operator $X \\mapsto X^{ul}$.\n\nRecall that for any $p \\in P$, the principal ideal $\\downarrow p = \\{x \\in P : x \\leq p\\}$ is always closed (i.e., $(\\downarrow p)^{ul} = \\downarrow p$).

        "answer": "Here is the complete and rigorous solution to the problem.\n\n### Part 1: Commutativity and Characteristic\n\n**Statement:** We must prove that a finite ring $R$ with identity $1$ satisfying $x^2 = x$ for all $x \\in R$ is commutative and has characteristic $2$.\n\n**Proof of Characteristic 2:**\nLet $x$ be any element in $R$. By the hypothesis, we have:\n$$ x^2 = x $$\nConsider the element $x+x$. Applying the hypothesis to this element:\n$$ (x+x)^2 = x+x $$\nWe expand the left side using the distributive laws (note that we do not assume commutativity yet):\n$$ (x+x)(x+x) = x(x+x) + x(x+x) = x^2 + x^2 + x^2 + x^2 $$\nSubstituting $x^2 = x$:\n$$ (x+x)^2 = x + x + x + x = 4x $$\nEquating the two expressions for $(x+x)^2$:\n$$ 4x = 2x $$\nSubtracting $2x$ from both sides (which is valid in the additive group of the ring), we obtain:\n$$ 2x = 0 $$\nSince this holds for all $x \\in R$, and $R$ has a multiplicative identity $1$, we set $x=1$:\n$$ 2 \\cdot 1 = 1 + 1 = 0 $$\nThus, the characteristic of $R$ is $2$.\n\n**Proof of Commutativity:**\nLet $x, y$ be any elements in $R$. Consider the element $x+y$. By the hypothesis:\n$$ (x+y)^2 = x+y $$\nExpanding the left side:\n$$ (x+y)(x+y) = x^2 + xy + yx + y^2 $$\nUsing the property $z^2 = z$ for $z=x$ and $z=y$:\n$$ (x+y)^2 = x + xy + yx + y $$\nEquating the expressions:\n$$ x + xy + yx + y = x + y $$\nSubtracting $x+y$ from both sides yields:\n$$ xy + yx = 0 $$\nThis implies $xy = -yx$. From the characteristic $2$ property established above, every element is its own additive inverse (since $z + z = 0 \\implies z = -z$). Therefore, $-yx = yx$.\nSubstituting this back, we get:\n$$ xy = yx $$\nSince this holds for all $x, y \\in R$, the ring $R$ is commutative.\n\n***\n\n### Part 2: Isomorphism Type\n\n**Statement:** We must determine the isomorphism type of $R$, show that $R \\cong (\\mathbb{F}_2)^n$, and express $n$ in terms of $|R|$.\n\n**Proof:**\nSince $R$ is a finite commutative ring with identity, we can analyze its structure.\n\n**Step 1: $R$ contains no non-zero nilpotent elements.**\nAn element $x$ is nilpotent if $x^k = 0$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$.\nSince $x^2 = x$, by induction $x^{2^m} = x$ for any integer $m \\ge 1$.\nChoose $m$ such that $2^m \\ge k$. Then $x = x^{2^m} = x^{2^m - k} \\cdot x^k = x^{2^m - k} \\cdot 0 = 0$.\nThus, the only nilpotent element in $R$ is $0$. The ring is reduced.\n\n**Step 2: Decomposition into fields.**\nA finite commutative ring is Artinian. A standard result in ring theory states that a finite commutative ring is isomorphic to the direct product of local rings. Let $R \\cong R_1 \\times R_2 \\times \\dots \\times R_n$, where each $R_i$ is a finite local ring.\nIn a local ring $R_i$, the maximal ideal $\\mathfrak{m}_i$ consists of nilpotent elements. Since $R$ is reduced, each $R_i$ must be reduced. Therefore, $\\mathfrak{m}_i = \\{0\\}$.\nConsequently, each $R_i$ is a field.\n\n**Step 3: Structure of the fields $R_i$.**\nLet $K$ be any of the fields $R_i$. The elements of $K$ must satisfy the polynomial equation $z^2 - z = 0$.\nIn a field, a polynomial of degree $d$ has at most $d$ roots.

        "raw_answer": "Here is the complete and rigorous solution to the problem.\n\n### Part 1: Commutativity and Characteristic\n\n**Statement:** We must prove that a finite ring $R$ with identity $1$ satisfying $x^2 = x$ for all $x \\in R$ is commutative and has characteristic $2$.\n\n**Proof of Characteristic 2:**\nLet $x$ be any element in $R$. By the hypothesis, we have:\n$$ x^2 = x $$\nConsider the element $x+x$. Applying the hypothesis to this element:\n$$ (x+x)^2 = x+x $$\nWe expand the left side using the distributive laws (note that we do not assume commutativity yet):\n$$ (x+x)(x+x) = x(x+x) + x(x+x) = x^2 + x^2 + x^2 + x^2 $$\nSubstituting $x^2 = x$:\n$$ (x+x)^2 = x + x + x + x = 4x $$\nEquating the two expressions for $(x+x)^2$:\n$$ 4x = 2x $$\nSubtracting $2x$ from both sides (which is valid in the additive group of the ring), we obtain:\n$$ 2x = 0 $$\nSince this holds for all $x \\in R$, and $R$ has a multiplicative identity $1$, we set $x=1$:\n$$ 2 \\cdot 1 = 1 + 1 = 0 $$\nThus, the characteristic of $R$ is $2$.\n\n**Proof of Commutativity:**\nLet $x, y$ be any elements in $R$. Consider the element $x+y$. By the hypothesis:\n$$ (x+y)^2 = x+y $$\nExpanding the left side:\n$$ (x+y)(x+y) = x^2 + xy + yx + y^2 $$\nUsing the property $z^2 = z$ for $z=x$ and $z=y$:\n$$ (x+y)^2 = x + xy + yx + y $$\nEquating the expressions:\n$$ x + xy + yx + y = x + y $$\nSubtracting $x+y$ from both sides yields:\n$$ xy + yx = 0 $$\nThis implies $xy = -yx$. From the characteristic $2$ property established above, every element is its own additive inverse (since $z + z = 0 \\implies z = -z$). Therefore, $-yx = yx$.\nSubstituting this back, we get:\n$$ xy = yx $$\nSince this holds for all $x, y \\in R$, the ring $R$ is commutative.\n\n***\n\n### Part 2: Isomorphism Type\n\n**Statement:** We must determine the isomorphism type of $R$, show that $R \\cong (\\mathbb{F}_2)^n$, and express $n$ in terms of $|R|$.\n\n**Proof:**\nSince $R$ is a finite commutative ring with identity, we can analyze its structure.\n\n**Step 1: $R$ contains no non-zero nilpotent elements.**\nAn element $x$ is nilpotent if $x^k = 0$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$.\nSince $x^2 = x$, by induction $x^{2^m} = x$ for any integer $m \\ge 1$.\nChoose $m$ such that $2^m \\ge k$. Then $x = x^{2^m} = x^{2^m - k} \\cdot x^k = x^{2^m - k} \\cdot 0 = 0$.\nThus, the only nilpotent element in $R$ is $0$. The ring is reduced.\n\n**Step 2: Decomposition into fields.**\nA finite commutative ring is Artinian. A standard result in ring theory states that a finite commutative ring is isomorphic to the direct product of local rings. Let $R \\cong R_1 \\times R_2 \\times \\dots \\times R_n$, where each $R_i$ is a finite local ring.\nIn a local ring $R_i$, the maximal ideal $\\mathfrak{m}_i$ consists of nilpotent elements. Since $R$ is reduced, each $R_i$ must be reduced. Therefore, $\\mathfrak{m}_i = \\{0\\}$.\nConsequently, each $R_i$ is a field.\n\n**Step 3: Structure of the fields $R_i$.**\nLet $K$ be any of the fields $R_i$. The elements of $K$ must satisfy the polynomial equation $z^2 - z = 0$.\nIn a field, a polynomial of degree $d$ has at most $d$ roots. The roots of $z^2 - z = z(z-1)$ are $0$ and $1$.\nThus, $K$ can only contain the elements $\\{0, 1\\}$.\nSince $K$ is a field (and thus contains distinct additive and multiplicative identities $0$ and $1$), we must have $K \\cong \\mathbb{F}_2$ (the field with 2 elements).\n\n**Conclusion on Isomorphism:**\nTherefore, $R$ is isomorphic to the direct product of $n$ copies of $\\mathbb{F}_2$:\n$$ R \\cong \\underbrace{\\mathbb{F}_2 \\times \\mathbb{F}_2 \\times \\dots \\times \\mathbb{F}_2}_{n \\text{ times}} \\cong (\\mathbb{F}_2)^n $$\nwhere addition and multiplication are defined coordinatewise.\n\n**Step 4: Expressing $n$ in terms of $|R|$.**\nThe cardinality (size) of the direct product is the product of the cardinalities of the factors.\n$$ |R| = |(\\mathbb{F}_2)^n| = |\\mathbb{F}_2|^n = 2^n $$\nSolving for $n$:\n$$ n = \\log_2 |R| $$\n\n**Final Answer:**\n1.

        "answer": "Here is the complete solution to the problem.\n\n### 1. Normality of $A$ and Singular Locus of $X$\n\nFirst, we establish the algebraic properties of the ring $A = k[x,y,z]/(xy - z^n)$ and the geometry of $X = \\operatorname{Spec}(A)$.\n\n**Irreducibility:**\nThe polynomial $f = xy - z^n$ is linear in $y$, taking the form $f = x(y) - z^n$. Regarded as a polynomial in $k[x,z][y]$, its coefficients are $x$ and $-z^n$. In the unique factorization domain $k[x,z]$, $x$ is irreducible and $x \\nmid z^n$. Thus, the greatest common divisor of the coefficients is $1$, so $f$ is primitive. Since it is linear in $y$, it is irreducible in $k[x,z][y]$, and by Gauss's Lemma, irreducible in $k[x,y,z]$. Since $k[x,y,z]$ is a UFD, the ideal $(xy - z^n)$ is prime, and $A$ is an integral domain.\n\n**Singular Locus:**\nWe apply the Jacobian criterion. The singular locus of the hypersurface $X$ defined by $f=0$ in $\\mathbb{A}^3$ is given by the vanishing of $f$ and its partial derivatives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = y = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = x = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} = -nz^{n-1} = 0.\n$$\nSince $\\operatorname{char}(k) \\nmid n$, the condition $-nz^{n-1} = 0$ implies $z^{n-1} = 0$, and thus $z=0$.\nSubstituting $x=0$ and $y=0$ into the equation of the variety $xy - z^n = 0$, we verify that $0\\cdot 0 - 0^n = 0$.\nThus, the singular locus consists of the single point $(0,0,0)$, which corresponds to the maximal ideal $\\mathfrak{m} = (x,y,z)$.\nThe dimension of $X$ is $\\dim(k[x,y,z]) - 1 = 2$. The singular locus has dimension 0.\n\n**Normality:**\nWe use Serre's Criterion for normality: a Noetherian domain is normal if and only if it satisfies conditions $S_2$ and $R_1$.\n1.  **$S_2$ Condition:** Since $A$ is a hypersurface in affine space (a complete intersection), $A$ is Cohen-Macaulay. Every Cohen-Macaulay ring satisfies the $S_2$ condition.\n2.  **$R_1$ Condition:** A ring is $R_1$ if it is regular in codimension 1. The singular locus of $X$ is the point $\\mathfrak{m}$, which has codimension 2 in $X$ (since $\\dim X = 2$). Therefore, the regular locus contains all prime ideals of height 1. Thus, $A$ satisfies $R_1$.\n\nSince $A$ satisfies both $S_2$ and $R_1$, $A$ is a normal domain.\n\n### 2. Computation of $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$\n\nWe compute the divisor class group using the exact sequence relating the class group of $A$ to the class group of a localization. Let $U = D(x) \\subset X$ be the open set where $x \\neq 0$.

        "raw_answer": "Here is the complete solution to the problem.\n\n### 1. Normality of $A$ and Singular Locus of $X$\n\nFirst, we establish the algebraic properties of the ring $A = k[x,y,z]/(xy - z^n)$ and the geometry of $X = \\operatorname{Spec}(A)$.\n\n**Irreducibility:**\nThe polynomial $f = xy - z^n$ is linear in $y$, taking the form $f = x(y) - z^n$. Regarded as a polynomial in $k[x,z][y]$, its coefficients are $x$ and $-z^n$. In the unique factorization domain $k[x,z]$, $x$ is irreducible and $x \\nmid z^n$. Thus, the greatest common divisor of the coefficients is $1$, so $f$ is primitive. Since it is linear in $y$, it is irreducible in $k[x,z][y]$, and by Gauss's Lemma, irreducible in $k[x,y,z]$. Since $k[x,y,z]$ is a UFD, the ideal $(xy - z^n)$ is prime, and $A$ is an integral domain.\n\n**Singular Locus:**\nWe apply the Jacobian criterion. The singular locus of the hypersurface $X$ defined by $f=0$ in $\\mathbb{A}^3$ is given by the vanishing of $f$ and its partial derivatives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = y = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = x = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} = -nz^{n-1} = 0.\n$$\nSince $\\operatorname{char}(k) \\nmid n$, the condition $-nz^{n-1} = 0$ implies $z^{n-1} = 0$, and thus $z=0$.\nSubstituting $x=0$ and $y=0$ into the equation of the variety $xy - z^n = 0$, we verify that $0\\cdot 0 - 0^n = 0$.\nThus, the singular locus consists of the single point $(0,0,0)$, which corresponds to the maximal ideal $\\mathfrak{m} = (x,y,z)$.\nThe dimension of $X$ is $\\dim(k[x,y,z]) - 1 = 2$. The singular locus has dimension 0.\n\n**Normality:**\nWe use Serre's Criterion for normality: a Noetherian domain is normal if and only if it satisfies conditions $S_2$ and $R_1$.\n1.  **$S_2$ Condition:** Since $A$ is a hypersurface in affine space (a complete intersection), $A$ is Cohen-Macaulay. Every Cohen-Macaulay ring satisfies the $S_2$ condition.\n2.  **$R_1$ Condition:** A ring is $R_1$ if it is regular in codimension 1. The singular locus of $X$ is the point $\\mathfrak{m}$, which has codimension 2 in $X$ (since $\\dim X = 2$). Therefore, the regular locus contains all prime ideals of height 1. Thus, $A$ satisfies $R_1$.\n\nSince $A$ satisfies both $S_2$ and $R_1$, $A$ is a normal domain.\n\n### 2.

The total size of the matrix is 10, so $\\sum k \\cdot n_k = 10$.\nThe number of blocks of size at least $k$, denoted by $b_k$, is related to the ranks of the powers of $N$ by the formula:\n$$ b_k = \\rank(N^{k-1}) - \\rank(N^k) $$\nwhere $\\rank(N^0) = \\rank(I_{10}) = 10$.\n\nGiven the ranks in the problem statement:\n- $r_0 = \\rank(I) = 10$\n- $r_1 = \\rank(N) = 6$\n- $r_2 = \\rank(N^2) = 3$\n- $r_3 = \\rank(N^3) = 1$\n- $r_4 = \\rank(N^4) = 0$\n\nWe compute $b_k$:\n- $b_1 = r_0 - r_1 = 10 - 6 = 4$ (Total number of blocks)\n- $b_2 = r_1 - r_2 = 6 - 3 = 3$ (Number of blocks of size $\\ge 2$)\n- $b_3 = r_2 - r_3 = 3 - 1 = 2$ (Number of blocks of size $\\ge 3$)\n- $b_4 = r_3 - r_4 = 1 - 0 = 1$ (Number of blocks of size $\\ge 4$)\n- $b_5 = r_4 - r_5 = 0 - 0 = 0$\n\nThe number of blocks of size exactly $k$ is $n_k = b_k - b_{k+1}$:\n- $n_1 = 4 - 3 = 1$\n- $n_2 = 3 - 2 = 1$\n- $n_3 = 2 - 1 = 1$\n- $n_4 = 1 - 0 = 1$\n\nThus, the Jordan canonical form of $N$ consists of one block each of sizes 4, 3, 2, and 1.\nThe partition of 10 corresponding to the sizes of the Jordan blocks is $\\lambda = (4, 3, 2, 1)$.\n\n**Conclusion:** The Jordan canonical form of $N$ is\n$$ J = J_4(0) \\oplus J_3(0) \\oplus J_2(0) \\oplus J_1(0) $$\n\n---\n\n### 2. Compute $\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}\\mathcal{C}(N)$\n\nThe dimension of the commutant (centralizer) $\\mathcal{C}(N)$ of a nilpotent matrix associated with a partition $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\dots, \\lambda_m)$ is given by the Frobenius formula:\n$$ \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}\\mathcal{C}(N) = \\sum_{i=1}^m \\sum_{j=1}^m \\min(\\lambda_i, \\lambda_j) $$\nUsing the partition $\\lambda = (4, 3, 2, 1)$, we sum the minimums of all pairs $(\\lambda_i, \\lambda_j)$.\n\nWe can break this sum into diagonal terms ($i=j$) and off-diagonal terms ($i \\neq j$). Since $\\min(\\lambda_i, \\lambda_j) = \\min(\\lambda_j, \\lambda_i)$, the matrix of minimums is symmetric.\n\n**Diagonal terms:**\n- $\\min(4, 4) = 4$\n- $\\min(3, 3) = 3$\n- $\\min(2, 2) = 2$\n- $\\min(1, 1) = 1$\nSum $= 10$.\n\n**Off-diagonal terms (computed for $i < j$ and multiplied by 2):**\n- Pairs with 4: $\\min(4,3)=3$, $\\min(4,2)=2$, $\\min(4,1)=1$. Sum $= 6$.\n- Pairs with 3: $\\min(3,2)=2$, $\\min(3,1)=1$. Sum $= 3$.\n- Pairs with 2: $\\min(2,1)=1$. Sum $= 1$.\nTotal off-diagonal sum $= 2 \\times (6 + 3 + 1) = 2 \\times 10 = 20$.\n\n**Total Dimension:**\n$$ \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}\\mathcal{C}(N) = 10 + 20 = 30 $$\n\n---\n\n### 3. Compute $\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}\\ker(\\Lambda^2 N)$\n\nLet $V = \\mathbb{C}^{10}$. The operator $D_N = \\Lambda^2 N$ acts on $\\Lambda^2 V$ by the rule $D_N(v \\wedge w) = Nv \\wedge w + v \\wedge Nw$. This is the action of $N$ as an element of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{gl}(V)$ on the representation $\\Lambda^2 V$. Since $N$ is nilpotent, $D_N$ is also a nilpotent operator. The dimension of the kernel of a nilpotent operator is equal to the number of Jordan blocks in its Jordan decomposition.\n\nIn the context of representation theory (specifically for $\\mathfrak{sl}_2(\\mathbb{C})$ where $N$ plays the role of the raising operator), the number of Jordan blocks is the number of irreducible components in the decomposition of the module.\n\nWe decompose $V$ into irreducible submodules (Jordan blocks):\n$$ V \\cong V_4 \\oplus V_3 \\oplus V_2 \\oplus V_1 $$\nwhere $V_k$ denotes the standard Jordan block space of dimension $k$.\n\nThe exterior square decomposes as:\n$$ \\Lambda^2 V \\cong \\bigoplus_{k=1}^4 \\Lambda^2 V_{n_k} \\oplus \\bigoplus_{1 \\le i < j \\le 4} (V_{n_i} \\otimes V_{n_j}) $$\nwhere $n_1=4, n_2=3, n_3=2, n_4=1$. The operator $D_N$ respects this decomposition. Thus,\n$$ \\dim \\ker(D_N) = \\sum_{k} \\dim \\ker(D_N|_{\\Lambda^2 V_{n_k}}) + \\sum_{i<j} \\dim \\ker(D_N|_{V_{n_i} \\otimes V_{n_j}}) $$\n\n**Sub-problem A: Kernel dimension for $V_a \\otimes V_b$**\nFor the tensor product of two Jordan blocks of sizes $a$ and $b$ (assume $a \\ge b$), the Clebsch-Gordan decomposition tells us that $V_a \\otimes V_b$ decomposes into $b$ irreducible components (Jordan blocks).\nTherefore, the kernel dimension (number of blocks) is:\n$$ \\dim \\ker(D_N|_{V_a \\otimes V_b}) = \\min(a, b) $$\n\n**Sub-problem B: Kernel dimension for $\\Lambda^2 V_a$**\nThe exterior square $\\Lambda^2 V_a$ decomposes into irreducible components. The number of components is given by $\\lfloor a/2 \\rfloor$.\nProof sketch: The weights of $V_a$ are symmetric around 0. The weights of $\\Lambda^2 V_a$ are sums of distinct pairs of weights. Representation theory of $\\mathfrak{sl}_2$ shows $\\Lambda^2 V_a \\cong V_{2a-3} \\oplus V_{2a-7} \\oplus \\dots$. The number of terms in this series is $\\lfloor a/2 \\rfloor$.\nThus:\n$$ \\dim \\ker(D_N|_{\\Lambda^2 V_a}) = \\lfloor a/2 \\rfloor $$\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1. **Contributions from $\\Lambda^2 V_{n_k}$:**\n   - $\\Lambda^2 V_4$: $\\lfloor 4/2 \\rfloor = 2$\n   - $\\Lambda^2 V_3$: $\\lfloor 3/2 \\rfloor = 1$\n   - $\\Lambda^2 V_2$: $\\lfloor 2/2 \\rfloor = 1$\n   - $\\Lambda^2 V_1$: $\\lfloor 1/2 \\rfloor = 0$\n   Sum $= 2 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 4$.\n\n2. **Contributions from $V_{n_i} \\otimes V_{n_j}$ ($i < j$):**\n   The pairs of sizes are (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1).\n   - $\\min(4, 3) = 3$\n   - $\\min(4, 2) = 2$\n   - $\\min(4, 1) = 1$\n   - $\\min(3, 2) = 2$\n   - $\\min(3, 1) = 1$\n   - $\\min(2, 1) = 1$\n   Sum $= 3 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 10$.\n\n**Total Kernel Dimension:**\n$$ \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}\\ker(\\Lambda^2 N) = 4 + 10 = 14 $$\n\n### Final Answer\n\n1. The Jordan canonical form of $N$ consists of blocks of sizes **4, 3, 2, and 1**.\n2. The dimension of the commutant is $\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}\\mathcal{C}(N) = \\mathbf{30}$.\n3. The dimension of the kernel of the induced map is $\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}\\ker(\\Lambda^2 N) = \\mathbf{14}$.",

Jacobson Radical and Ideals\n\n**Jacobson Radical $J(A)$:**\nLet $I = (x, y)$ be the two-sided ideal generated by $x$ and $y$. As a vector space, $I = \\operatorname{span}_k(x, y, w)$.\nComputing powers of $I$:\n- $I^2$ is spanned by products of generators $\\{x, y\\}$: $x^2=0, xy=w, yx=-w, y^2=0$. Thus $I^2 = (w) = \\operatorname{span}_k(w)$.\n- $I^3 = I \\cdot I^2 = \\operatorname{span}_k(x, y) \\cdot \\operatorname{span}_k(w)$. Since $xw=yw=0$, $I^3 = 0$.\n\nSince $I$ is a nilpotent ideal, $I \\subseteq J(A)$.\nThe quotient $A/I$ is isomorphic to $k$ (via the map sending $c_0 + c_1x + c_2y + c_3w \\mapsto c_0$). Since $k$ is a field, $A/I$ is a simple semisimple algebra. Therefore, $J(A) = I = \\operatorname{span}_k(x, y, w)$.\n\n**Powers of $J(A)$:**\n- $J(A) = \\operatorname{span}_k(x, y, w)$\n- $J(A)^2 = \\operatorname{span}_k(w)$\n- $J(A)^3 = \\{0\\}$\n\n**Local Algebra:**\nAn algebra $A$ is local if $A/J(A)$ is a division ring. Here $A/J(A) \\cong k$, which is a field. Thus, $A$ is a local algebra.\n\n**Classification of Two-Sided Ideals:**\nLet $K$ be a two-sided ideal of $A$.\n1. If $K \\not\\subseteq J(A)$, then $K$ contains an element with a non-zero scalar part (a unit), so $K = A$.\n2. Assume $K \\subseteq J(A)$.\n   - If $K \\subseteq J(A)^2 = (w)$, then $K$ is a subspace of a 1-dimensional space. The possibilities are $K = \\{0\\}$ or $K = (w)$.\n   - If $K \\not\\subseteq (w)$, let $z \\in K \\setminus (w)$. We can write $z = ax + by + cw$ with $a,b,c \\in k$ and $(a,b) \\neq (0,0)$.\n     Compute products with generators:\n     $x z = x(ax + by + cw) = b(xy) = bw$.\n     $y z = y(ax + by + cw) = a(yx) = -aw$.\n     Since $\\operatorname{char}(k) \\neq 2$ and $(a,b) \\neq (0,0)$, at least one of $bw$ or $-aw$ is non-zero. Since $K$ is an ideal, $w \\in K$.\n     Consequently, if $K$ is a non-zero ideal not contained in $(w)$, then $(w) \\subset K \\subseteq J(A)$.\n\n   By the Correspondence Theorem, ideals $K$ such that $(w) \\subset K \\subseteq J(A)$ correspond to subspaces of $J(A)/(w) \\cong \\operatorname{span}_k(\\bar{x}, \\bar{y})$. The subspaces of this 2-dimensional vector space are:\n   - The zero subspace (corresponds to $K=(w)$).\n   - The whole space (corresponds to $K=J(A)$).\n   - 1-dimensional lines. A line is spanned by $\\bar{u} = a\\bar{x} + b\\bar{y}$ for $[a:b] \\in \\mathbb{P}^1(k)$. The corresponding ideal is generated by $ax+by$ and $w$. Note that the ideal generated by just $ax+by$ contains $(ax+by)y = aw$ (or $-bw$ via $x$), so it automatically contains $w$ as long as $a,b$ are not both 0. Thus, these are the principal ideals $(ax+by)$.\n\n**List of all two-sided ideals:**\n1. The zero ideal: $\\{0\\}$.\n2. The ideal generated by $w$: $J(A)^2 = (w)$.\n3. The principal ideals $I_{a,b} = (ax + by)$ for each point $[a:b] \\in \\mathbb{P}^1(k)$.\n4. The maximal ideal: $J(A) = (x, y)$.\n5. The whole algebra: $A$.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Computation of the Center $Z(A)$\n\nLet $z = c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 y + c_3 w$ be an arbitrary element of $A$. For $z$ to be in the center, it must commute with the generators $x$ and $y$.\n1. Commutation with $x$:\n   $$[x, z] = c_1[x, x] + c_2[x, y] + c_3[x, w] = 0 + c_2(2w) + 0 = 2c_2 w.$$\n   Since $\\operatorname{char}(k) \\neq 2$, $[x, z] = 0 \\implies c_2 = 0$.\n2. Commutation with $y$:\n   With $c_2 = 0$, let $z = c_0 + c_1 x + c_3 w$.\n   $$[y, z] = c_1[y, x] + c_3[y, w] = c_1(-2w) + 0 = -2c_1 w.$$\n   Since $\\operatorname{char}(k) \\neq 2$, $[y, z] = 0 \\implies c_1 = 0$.\n\nThus, $z = c_0 + c_3 w$. These elements commute with $x$ and $y$ (and clearly $w$ since $w \\in Z(A)$ is trivial as $wJ(A) = J(A)w = 0$).\n**Conclusion:**\n$$Z(A) = \\operatorname{span}_k(1, w).$$\n\n---\n\n### 4. Automorphisms\n\nLet $\\varphi \\in \\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A)$.\n1. **Invariance:** $\\varphi$ must map the radical $J(A)$ to itself and $J(A)^2=(w)$ to itself.\n   Since $\\varphi(1)=1$, $\\varphi$ is determined by its action on $x$ and $y$.\n   Let:\n   $$ \\varphi(x) = ax + by + \\alpha w $$\n   $$ \\varphi(y) = cx + dy + \\beta w $$\n   for scalars $a,b,c,d,\\alpha,\\beta \\in k$.\n\n2. **Homomorphism Conditions:** We check if these definitions preserve the relations $x^2=0, y^2=0, xy+yx=0$.\n   Recall that $u^2=0$ for any $u \\in J(A)$.\n   - $\\varphi(x)^2 = (ax + by + \\alpha w)^2 = (ax+by)^2 = a^2x^2 + ab(xy+yx) + b^2y^2 = 0$. (Satisfied)\n   - $\\varphi(y)^2 = 0$. (Satisfied by symmetry)\n   - $\\varphi(x)\\varphi(y) + \\varphi(y)\\varphi(x) = 0$:\n     $$ \\varphi(x)\\varphi(y) = (ax+by)(cx+dy) = acx^2 + adxy + bcyx + bdy^2 = (ad-bc)w $$\n     $$ \\varphi(y)\\varphi(x) = (cx+dy)(ax+by) = cax^2 + cbxy + dayx + dby^2 = (cb-da)w $$\n     Sum: $((ad-bc) + (cb-da))w = 0$. (Satisfied)\n\n   Additionally, $\\varphi(w) = \\varphi(xy) = \\varphi(x)\\varphi(y) = (ad-bc)w$.\n\n3. **Bijectivity Condition:**\n   For $\\varphi$ to be an automorphism, the induced map on the vector space $J(A)/J(A)^2$ (with basis $\\bar{x}, \\bar{y}$) must be invertible. The matrix of this map is $M = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$ (acting on the basis $x,y$).\n   Thus, we require $\\det(M) = ad-bc \\neq 0$.\n   If this holds, $\\varphi$ maps $w \\to \\det(M)w \\neq 0$, so the restriction to $(w)$ is an isomorphism. By the 5-lemma or dimension counting, $\\varphi$ is an isomorphism on $A$.\n   The scalars are uniquely determined by the image of the basis elements.\n\n4. **Exact Sequence:**\n   Let $G = \\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A)$. We established a map $\\pi: G \\to \\mathrm{GL}_2(k)$ sending $\\varphi$ to $\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$.\n   - **Surjectivity:** For any $M \\in \\mathrm{GL}_2(k)$, setting $\\alpha=\\beta=0$ defines a valid automorphism.\n   - **Kernel:** The kernel $K = \\ker(\\pi)$ consists of automorphisms where $a=1, d=1, b=0, c=0$.\n     $$ \\varphi(x) = x + \\alpha w, \\quad \\varphi(y) = y + \\beta w $$\n     Composing two such maps:\n     $$ \\varphi_2(\\varphi_1(x)) = \\varphi_2(x + \\alpha_1 w) = (x + \\alpha_2 w) + \\alpha_1 \\varphi_2(w) $$\n     Since $\\varphi(w) = (1\\cdot1 - 0\\cdot0)w = w$ for maps in the kernel,\n     $$ \\varphi_2(\\varphi_1(x)) = x + (\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2)w $$\n     Similarly for $y$. This shows $K \\cong (k^2, +)$.\n\n   Thus, we have the short exact sequence:\n   $$ 1 \\longrightarrow k^2 \\longrightarrow \\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A) \\xrightarrow{\\;\\pi\\;} \\mathrm{GL}_2(k) \\longrightarrow 1 $$\n\n   **Splitting:**\n   The map $s: \\mathrm{GL}_2(k) \\to \\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A)$ defined by $s(M) = \\varphi$ with $\\varphi(x) = ax+by, \\varphi(y) = cx+dy$ (i.e., $\\alpha=\\beta=0$) is a group homomorphism:\n   The linear part of the composition is simply matrix multiplication, and with zero $w$-components, no \"cross-terms\" generating $w$ shifts arise.\n   Since $\\pi \\circ s = \\operatorname{id}_{\\mathrm{GL}_2(k)}$, the sequence splits.\n\n**Final Result:**\nThe group of automorphisms is the semidirect product $k^2 \\rtimes \\mathrm{GL}_2(k)$, where $\\mathrm{GL}_2(k)$ acts on $k^2$ via the determinant scaled action (specifically, if $\\varphi_v \\in k^2$ and $\\varphi_M \\in \\mathrm{GL}_2$, $\\varphi_M \\circ \\varphi_v \\circ \\varphi_M^{-1}$ corresponds to the action of $M$ on $v$ scaled by $\\det(M)^{-1}$). However, the question asks only to deduce the split exact sequence, which is:\n$$\n1\\to k^2 \\to \\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A)\\to \\mathrm{GL}_2(k)\\to 1.\n$$",

Here $A/J(A) \\cong k$, which is a field. Thus, $A$ is a local algebra.\n\n**Classification of Two-Sided Ideals:**\nLet $K$ be a two-sided ideal of $A$.\n1. If $K \\not\\subseteq J(A)$, then $K$ contains an element with a non-zero scalar part (a unit), so $K = A$.\n2. Assume $K \\subseteq J(A)$.\n   - If $K \\subseteq J(A)^2 = (w)$, then $K$ is a subspace of a 1-dimensional space. The possibilities are $K = \\{0\\}$ or $K = (w)$.\n   - If $K \\not\\subseteq (w)$, let $z \\in K \\setminus (w)$. We can write $z = ax + by + cw$ with $a,b,c \\in k$ and $(a,b) \\neq (0,0)$.\n     Compute products with generators:\n     $x z = x(ax + by + cw) = b(xy) = bw$.\n     $y z = y(ax + by + cw) = a(yx) = -aw$.\n     Since $\\operatorname{char}(k) \\neq 2$ and $(a,b) \\neq (0,0)$, at least one of $bw$ or $-aw$ is non-zero. Since $K$ is an ideal, $w \\in K$.\n     Consequently, if $K$ is a non-zero ideal not contained in $(w)$, then $(w) \\subset K \\subseteq J(A)$.\n\n   By the Correspondence Theorem, ideals $K$ such that $(w) \\subset K \\subseteq J(A)$ correspond to subspaces of $J(A)/(w) \\cong \\operatorname{span}_k(\\bar{x}, \\bar{y})$. The subspaces of this 2-dimensional vector space are:\n   - The zero subspace (corresponds to $K=(w)$).\n   - The whole space (corresponds to $K=J(A)$).\n   - 1-dimensional lines. A line is spanned by $\\bar{u} = a\\bar{x} + b\\bar{y}$ for $[a:b] \\in \\mathbb{P}^1(k)$. The corresponding ideal is generated by $ax+by$ and $w$. Note that the ideal generated by just $ax+by$ contains $(ax+by)y = aw$ (or $-bw$ via $x$), so it automatically contains $w$ as long as $a,b$ are not both 0. Thus, these are the principal ideals $(ax+by)$.\n\n**List of all two-sided ideals:**\n1. The zero ideal: $\\{0\\}$.\n2. The ideal generated by $w$: $J(A)^2 = (w)$.\n3. The principal ideals $I_{a,b} = (ax + by)$ for each point $[a:b] \\in \\mathbb{P}^1(k)$.\n4. The maximal ideal: $J(A) = (x, y)$.\n5. The whole algebra: $A$.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Computation of the Center $Z(A)$\n\nLet $z = c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 y + c_3 w$ be an arbitrary element of $A$. For $z$ to be in the center, it must commute with the generators $x$ and $y$.\n1. Commutation with $x$:\n   $$[x, z] = c_1[x, x] + c_2[x, y] + c_3[x, w] = 0 + c_2(2w) + 0 = 2c_2 w.$$\n   Since $\\operatorname{char}(k) \\neq 2$, $[x, z] = 0 \\implies c_2 = 0$.\n2. Commutation with $y$:\n   With $c_2 = 0$, let $z = c_0 + c_1 x + c_3 w$.\n   $$[y, z] = c_1[y, x] + c_3[y, w] = c_1(-2w) + 0 = -2c_1 w.$$\n   Since $\\operatorname{char}(k) \\neq 2$, $[y, z] = 0 \\implies c_1 = 0$.\n\nThus, $z = c_0 + c_3 w$. These elements commute with $x$ and $y$ (and clearly $w$ since $w \\in Z(A)$ is trivial as $wJ(A) = J(A)w = 0$).\n**Conclusion:**\n$$Z(A) = \\operatorname{span}_k(1, w).$$\n\n---\n\n### 4. Automorphisms\n\nLet $\\varphi \\in \\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A)$.\n1. **Invariance:** $\\varphi$ must map the radical $J(A)$ to itself and $J(A)^2=(w)$ to itself.\n   Since $\\varphi(1)=1$, $\\varphi$ is determined by its action on $x$ and $y$.\n   Let:\n   $$ \\varphi(x) = ax + by + \\alpha w $$\n   $$ \\varphi(y) = cx + dy + \\beta w $$\n   for scalars $a,b,c,d,\\alpha,\\beta \\in k$.\n\n2. **Homomorphism Conditions:** We check if these definitions preserve the relations $x^2=0, y^2=0, xy+yx=0$.\n   Recall that $u^2=0$ for any $u \\in J(A)$.\n   - $\\varphi(x)^2 = (ax + by + \\alpha w)^2 = (ax+by)^2 = a^2x^2 + ab(xy+yx) + b^2y^2 = 0$. (Satisfied)\n   - $\\varphi(y)^2 = 0$. (Satisfied by symmetry)\n   - $\\varphi(x)\\varphi(y) + \\varphi(y)\\varphi(x) = 0$:\n     $$ \\varphi(x)\\varphi(y) = (ax+by)(cx+dy) = acx^2 + adxy + bcyx + bdy^2 = (ad-bc)w $$\n     $$ \\varphi(y)\\varphi(x) = (cx+dy)(ax+by) = cax^2 + cbxy + dayx + dby^2 = (cb-da)w $$\n     Sum: $((ad-bc) + (cb-da))w = 0$. (Satisfied)\n\n   Additionally, $\\varphi(w) = \\varphi(xy) = \\varphi(x)\\varphi(y) = (ad-bc)w$.\n\n3. **Bijectivity Condition:**\n   For $\\varphi$ to be an automorphism, the induced map on the vector space $J(A)/J(A)^2$ (with basis $\\bar{x}, \\bar{y}$) must be invertible. The matrix of this map is $M = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$ (acting on the basis $x,y$).\n   Thus, we require $\\det(M) = ad-bc \\neq 0$.\n   If this holds, $\\varphi$ maps $w \\to \\det(M)w \\neq 0$, so the restriction to $(w)$ is an isomorphism. By the 5-lemma or dimension counting, $\\varphi$ is an isomorphism on $A$.\n   The scalars are uniquely determined by the image of the basis elements.\n\n4. **Exact Sequence:**\n   Let $G = \\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A)$. We established a map $\\pi: G \\to \\mathrm{GL}_2(k)$ sending $\\varphi$ to $\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$.\n   - **Surjectivity:** For any $M \\in \\mathrm{GL}_2(k)$, setting $\\alpha=\\beta=0$ defines a valid automorphism.\n   - **Kernel:** The kernel $K = \\ker(\\pi)$ consists of automorphisms where $a=1, d=1, b=0, c=0$.\n     $$ \\varphi(x) = x + \\alpha w, \\quad \\varphi(y) = y + \\beta w $$\n     Composing two such maps:\n     $$ \\varphi_2(\\varphi_1(x)) = \\varphi_2(x + \\alpha_1 w) = (x + \\alpha_2 w) + \\alpha_1 \\varphi_2(w) $$\n     Since $\\varphi(w) = (1\\cdot1 - 0\\cdot0)w = w$ for maps in the kernel,\n     $$ \\varphi_2(\\varphi_1(x)) = x + (\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2)w $$\n     Similarly for $y$. This shows $K \\cong (k^2, +)$.\n\n   Thus, we have the short exact sequence:\n   $$ 1 \\longrightarrow k^2 \\longrightarrow \\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A) \\xrightarrow{\\;\\pi\\;} \\mathrm{GL}_2(k) \\longrightarrow 1 $$\n\n   **Splitting:**\n   The map $s: \\mathrm{GL}_2(k) \\to \\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A)$ defined by $s(M) = \\varphi$ with $\\varphi(x) = ax+by, \\varphi(y) = cx+dy$ (i.e., $\\alpha=\\beta=0$) is a group homomorphism:\n   The linear part of the composition is simply matrix multiplication, and with zero $w$-components, no \"cross-terms\" generating $w$ shifts arise.\n   Since $\\pi \\circ s = \\operatorname{id}_{\\mathrm{GL}_2(k)}$, the sequence splits.\n\n**Final Result:**\nThe group of automorphisms is the semidirect product $k^2 \\rtimes \\mathrm{GL}_2(k)$, where $\\mathrm{GL}_2(k)$ acts on $k^2$ via the determinant scaled action (specifically, if $\\varphi_v \\in k^2$ and $\\varphi_M \\in \\mathrm{GL}_2$, $\\varphi_M \\circ \\varphi_v \\circ \\varphi_M^{-1}$ corresponds to the action of $M$ on $v$ scaled by $\\det(M)^{-1}$). However, the question asks only to deduce the split exact sequence, which is:\n$$\n1\\to k^2 \\to \\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A)\\to \\mathrm{GL}_2(k)\\to 1.\n$$",

Derivations of the Jordan Algebra $J$\n\nA derivation $D$ is a linear map satisfying $D(X \\circ Y) = D(X) \\circ Y + X \\circ D(Y)$.\n\n**Existence of Inner Derivations:**\nLet us verify that maps of the form $D_C(X) = CX - XC$ (the commutator $[C,X]$) are derivations of $(J, \\circ)$.\nLHS:\n$$D_C(X \\circ Y) = [C, \\frac{1}{2}(XY+YX)] = \\frac{1}{2}(C(XY+YX) - (XY+YX)C)$$\nRHS:\n$$D_C(X) \\circ Y + X \\circ D_C(Y) = \\frac{1}{2} \\{ (CX-XC)Y + Y(CX-XC) + X(CY-YC) + (CY-YC)X \\}$$\n$$= \\frac{1}{2} \\{ CXY - XCY + YCX - YXC + XCY - XYC + CYX - YCX \\}$$\nCanceling terms $-XCY + XCY = 0$ and $YCX - YCX = 0$:\n$$= \\frac{1}{2} \\{ CXY - YXC - XYC + CYX \\} = \\frac{1}{2} \\{ C(XY+YX) - (XY+YX)C \\}$$\nThis matches the LHS. Thus, any $D_C(X) = [C,X]$ is a derivation.\n\n**Classification of All Derivations:**\nWe must show that *any* derivation $D$ is of the form $D_C$ for a unique traceless $C$.\nLet $D$ be an arbitrary derivation.\n\n1.  **Action on Identity:**\n    $D(I) = D(I \\circ I) = D(I) \\circ I + I \\circ D(I) = 2 D(I)$.\n    Thus $D(I) = 0$.\n    Since $I = E_{11} + E_{22}$, we have $D(E_{22}) = -D(E_{11})$.\n\n2.  **Action on Idempotent $E_{11}$:**\n    $E_{11}^2 = E_{11}$. Applying $D$: $D(E_{11}) = 2 (E_{11} \\circ D(E_{11}))$.\n    Let $D(E_{11}) = \\begin{pmatrix} x & y \\\\ z & w \\end{pmatrix}$. Since $D(E_{22}) = -D(E_{11})$, and the map $C \\mapsto [C, \\cdot]$ can accommodate any trace, we anticipate $D(E_{11})$ relates to commutators.\n    Compute $2 E_{11} \\circ D(E_{11}) = E_{11} \\begin{pmatrix} x & y \\\\ z & w \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} x & y \\\\ z & w \\end{pmatrix} E_{11} = \\begin{pmatrix} x & y \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} x & 0 \\\\ z & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2x & y \\\\ z & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    Equality $\\begin{pmatrix} x & y \\\\ z & w \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2x & y \\\\ z & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ implies $x=2x \\implies x=0$ and $w=0$.\n    So $D(E_{11}) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & y \\\\ z & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n3.  **Action on Nilpotents $E_{12}, E_{21}$:**\n    $E_{12}^2 = 0 \\implies 2 E_{12} \\circ D(E_{12}) = 0$.\n    Let $D(E_{12}) = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    $E_{12} \\circ D(E_{12}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} c & d+a \\\\ 0 & c \\end{pmatrix} = 0 \\implies c=0, d=-a$.\n    So $D(E_{12}) = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 0 & -a \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    Similarly, $E_{21}^2 = 0 \\implies D(E_{21}) = \\begin{pmatrix} p & 0 \\\\ r & -p \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n4.  **Relation between components:**\n    Use $E_{11} \\circ E_{12} = \\frac{1}{2} E_{12}$.\n    $D(E_{11}) \\circ E_{12} + E_{11} \\circ D(E_{12}) = \\frac{1}{2} D(E_{12})$.\n    LHS: $\\frac{1}{2} ( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & y \\\\ z & 0 \\end{pmatrix} E_{12} + E_{12} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & y \\\\ z & 0 \\end{pmatrix} ) + \\frac{1}{2} ( E_{11} \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 0 & -a \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 0 & -a \\end{pmatrix} E_{11} )$\n    $= \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} z & 0 \\\\ 0 & z \\end{pmatrix} + \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 2a & b \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} z+2a & b \\\\ 0 & z \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    RHS: $\\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 0 & -a \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    Equating terms: $z = -a$ and $z+2a = a \\implies a = -z$. Thus $a = -z$.\n    \n    Similarly, using $E_{11} \\circ E_{21} = \\frac{1}{2} E_{21}$, we find $p = -y$.\n    \n    Finally, using $E_{12} \\circ E_{21} = \\frac{1}{2}(E_{11} + E_{22}) = \\frac{1}{2}I$:\n    $D(E_{12}) \\circ E_{21} + E_{12} \\circ D(E_{21}) = D(\\frac{1}{2}I) = 0$.\n    This yields the relation $r = -b$.\n\n    **Summary of Derivation D:**\n    $D(E_{11}) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & y \\\\ z & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $D(E_{12}) = \\begin{pmatrix} -z & b \\\\ 0 & z \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $D(E_{21}) = \\begin{pmatrix} -y & 0 \\\\ -b & y \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $D(E_{22}) = -D(E_{11})$.\n    The derivation is completely determined by scalars $y, z, b$.\n\n5.  **Construction of Matrix $C$:**\n    We propose $D(X) = [C, X]$ where $C = \\begin{pmatrix} b/2 & -y \\\\ z & -b/2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    Note $C$ is traceless ($b/2 - b/2 = 0$).\n    Let's verify this $C$ produces the derivation above:\n    -   $[C, E_{11}] = \\begin{pmatrix} b/2 & -y \\\\ z & -b/2 \\end{pmatrix} E_{11} - E_{11} \\begin{pmatrix} b/2 & -y \\\\ z & -b/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} b/2 & 0 \\\\ z & 0 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} b/2 & -y \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & y \\\\ z & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. Matches.\n    -   $[C, E_{12}] = \\begin{pmatrix} b/2 & -y \\\\ z & -b/2 \\end{pmatrix} E_{12} - E_{12} C = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & b/2 \\\\ 0 & z \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} z & -b/2 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -z & b \\\\ 0 & z \\end{pmatrix}$. Matches.\n    -   $[C, E_{21}]$ similarly matches $\\begin{pmatrix} -y & 0 \\\\ -b & y \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n    Since $D$ and $[C, \\cdot]$ agree on the basis, $D(X) = CX - XC$ for all $X$.\n\n**Uniqueness:**\nSuppose $D(X) = CX - XC = C'X - XC'$ with $Tr(C) = Tr(C') = 0$.\nThen $[C-C', X] = 0$ for all $X \\in M_2(F)$.\nBy Schur's Lemma (or direct calculation), $C-C' = \\lambda I$ is a scalar matrix.\nTaking the trace: $Tr(C-C') = Tr(C) - Tr(C') = 0 - 0 = 0$.\n$Tr(\\lambda I) = 2\\lambda = 0$. Since $\\operatorname{char}(F) \\neq 2$, $\\lambda = 0$.\nThus $C = C'$.\n\n**Conclusion on Isomorphism:**\nThe map $\\Psi: \\mathfrak{sl}_2(F) \\to \\mathrm{Der}(J)$ defined by $C \\mapsto \\mathrm{ad}_C$ (where $\\mathrm{ad}_C(X) = [C, X]$) is:\n1.

A Lie algebra homomorphism: $[ \\mathrm{ad}_A, \\mathrm{ad}_B ] = \\mathrm{ad}_{[A,B]}$.\n\nTherefore, $\\mathrm{Der}(J) \\cong \\mathfrak{sl}_2(F)$.",

By definition:\n$$X \\circ Y = \\frac{1}{2}(XY + YX)$$\n$$Y \\circ X = \\frac{1}{2}(YX + XY)$$\nSince matrix addition is commutative ($XY + YX = YX + XY$), we have $X \\circ Y = Y \\circ X$.\n\n**Jordan Identity:**\nWe must prove $(X^2 \\circ Y) \\circ X = X^2 \\circ (Y \\circ X)$.\nFirst, note that the square in the Jordan algebra coincides with the standard matrix square:\n$$X^2 = X \\circ X = \\frac{1}{2}(XX + XX) = XX$$\n\nLet us expand the **Left Hand Side (LHS)**: $(X^2 \\circ Y) \\circ X$.\n$$X^2 \\circ Y = \\frac{1}{2}(X^2 Y + Y X^2)$$\n$$(X^2 \\circ Y) \\circ X = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\left( \\frac{1}{2}(X^2 Y + Y X^2) \\right) X + X \\left( \\frac{1}{2}(X^2 Y + Y X^2) \\right) \\right]$$\nFactoring out $\\frac{1}{4}$:\n$$= \\frac{1}{4} (X^2 Y X + Y X^3 + X^3 Y + X Y X^2)$$\n\nNow, expand the **Right Hand Side (RHS)**: $X^2 \\circ (Y \\circ X)$.\n$$Y \\circ X = \\frac{1}{2}(YX + XY)$$\n$$X^2 \\circ (Y \\circ X) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ X^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{2}(YX + XY) \\right) + \\left( \\frac{1}{2}(YX + XY) \\right) X^2 \\right]$$\nFactoring out $\\frac{1}{4}$:\n$$= \\frac{1}{4} (X^2 Y X + X^3 Y + Y X^3 + X Y X^2)$$\n\nComparing the expanded forms:\nLHS terms: $X^2 Y X, Y X^3, X^3 Y, X Y X^2$\nRHS terms: $X^2 Y X, X^3 Y, Y X^3, X Y X^2$\n\nThe terms are identical (addition is commutative). Thus, the Jordan identity holds.\n**Conclusion:** $(J, \\circ)$ is a Jordan algebra.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Non-associativity of $(J, \\circ)$\n\nWe need to find matrices $A, B, C \\in J$ such that $(A \\circ B) \\circ C \\neq A \\circ (B \\circ C)$.\nLet $E_{ij}$ denote the standard matrix units (1 in position $(i,j)$, 0 elsewhere). Consider:\n$$A = E_{12} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad B = E_{21} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad C = E_{11} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\n**Compute LHS: $(A \\circ B) \\circ C$**\n1.  Calculate $A \\circ B$:\n    $AB = E_{12}E_{21} = E_{11}$.\n    $BA = E_{21}E_{12} = E_{22}$.\n    $$A \\circ B = \\frac{1}{2}(E_{11} + E_{22}) = \\frac{1}{2}I$$\n2.  Calculate $(A \\circ B) \\circ C$:\n    Since $I$ is the identity for $\\circ$ (up to scalar), $I \\circ X = \\frac{1}{2}(IX + XI) = X$.\n    $$(\\frac{1}{2}I) \\circ E_{11} = \\frac{1}{2} (I \\circ E_{11}) = \\frac{1}{2} E_{11} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\n**Compute RHS: $A \\circ (B \\circ C)$**\n1.  Calculate $B \\circ C$:\n    $BC = E_{21}E_{11} = E_{21}$.\n    $CB = E_{11}E_{21} = 0$.\n    $$B \\circ C = \\frac{1}{2}(E_{21} + 0) = \\frac{1}{2} E_{21}$$\n2.  Calculate $A \\circ (B \\circ C)$:\n    $$A \\circ (\\frac{1}{2}E_{21}) = \\frac{1}{2} (E_{12} \\circ E_{21}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}(E_{12}E_{21} + E_{21}E_{12}) \\right)$$\n    $$= \\frac{1}{4} (E_{11} + E_{22}) = \\frac{1}{4} I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/4 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/4 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\n**Comparison:**\nLHS $= \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and RHS $= \\begin{pmatrix} 1/4 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/4 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThese are clearly not equal (e.g., the $(2,2)$ entry is $0 \\neq 1/4$ since $\\operatorname{char}(F) \\neq 2$).\n**Conclusion:** The algebra is not associative.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Derivations of the Jordan Algebra $J$\n\nA derivation $D$ is a linear map satisfying $D(X \\circ Y) = D(X) \\circ Y + X \\circ D(Y)$.\n\n**Existence of Inner Derivations:**\nLet us verify that maps of the form $D_C(X) = CX - XC$ (the commutator $[C,X]$) are derivations of $(J, \\circ)$.\nLHS:\n$$D_C(X \\circ Y) = [C, \\frac{1}{2}(XY+YX)] = \\frac{1}{2}(C(XY+YX) - (XY+YX)C)$$\nRHS:\n$$D_C(X) \\circ Y + X \\circ D_C(Y) = \\frac{1}{2} \\{ (CX-XC)Y + Y(CX-XC) + X(CY-YC) + (CY-YC)X \\}$$\n$$= \\frac{1}{2} \\{ CXY - XCY + YCX - YXC + XCY - XYC + CYX - YCX \\}$$\nCanceling terms $-XCY + XCY = 0$ and $YCX - YCX = 0$:\n$$= \\frac{1}{2} \\{ CXY - YXC - XYC + CYX \\} = \\frac{1}{2} \\{ C(XY+YX) - (XY+YX)C \\}$$\nThis matches the LHS. Thus, any $D_C(X) = [C,X]$ is a derivation.\n\n**Classification of All Derivations:**\nWe must show that *any* derivation $D$ is of the form $D_C$ for a unique traceless $C$.\nLet $D$ be an arbitrary derivation.\n\n1.  **Action on Identity:**\n    $D(I) = D(I \\circ I) = D(I) \\circ I + I \\circ D(I) = 2 D(I)$.\n    Thus $D(I) = 0$.\n    Since $I = E_{11} + E_{22}$, we have $D(E_{22}) = -D(E_{11})$.\n\n2.  **Action on Idempotent $E_{11}$:**\n    $E_{11}^2 = E_{11}$. Applying $D$: $D(E_{11}) = 2 (E_{11} \\circ D(E_{11}))$.\n    Let $D(E_{11}) = \\begin{pmatrix} x & y \\\\ z & w \\end{pmatrix}$. Since $D(E_{22}) = -D(E_{11})$, and the map $C \\mapsto [C, \\cdot]$ can accommodate any trace, we anticipate $D(E_{11})$ relates to commutators.\n    Compute $2 E_{11} \\circ D(E_{11}) = E_{11} \\begin{pmatrix} x & y \\\\ z & w \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} x & y \\\\ z & w \\end{pmatrix} E_{11} = \\begin{pmatrix} x & y \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} x & 0 \\\\ z & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2x & y \\\\ z & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    Equality $\\begin{pmatrix} x & y \\\\ z & w \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2x & y \\\\ z & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ implies $x=2x \\implies x=0$ and $w=0$.\n    So $D(E_{11}) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & y \\\\ z & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n3.  **Action on Nilpotents $E_{12}, E_{21}$:**\n    $E_{12}^2 = 0 \\implies 2 E_{12} \\circ D(E_{12}) = 0$.\n    Let $D(E_{12}) = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    $E_{12} \\circ D(E_{12}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} c & d+a \\\\ 0 & c \\end{pmatrix} = 0 \\implies c=0, d=-a$.\n    So $D(E_{12}) = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 0 & -a \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    Similarly, $E_{21}^2 = 0 \\implies D(E_{21}) = \\begin{pmatrix} p & 0 \\\\ r & -p \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n4.  **Relation between components:**\n    Use $E_{11} \\circ E_{12} = \\frac{1}{2} E_{12}$.\n    $D(E_{11}) \\circ E_{12} + E_{11} \\circ D(E_{12}) = \\frac{1}{2} D(E_{12})$.\n    LHS: $\\frac{1}{2} ( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & y \\\\ z & 0 \\end{pmatrix} E_{12} + E_{12} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & y \\\\ z & 0 \\end{pmatrix} ) + \\frac{1}{2} ( E_{11} \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 0 & -a \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 0 & -a \\end{pmatrix} E_{11} )$\n    $= \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} z & 0 \\\\ 0 & z \\end{pmatrix} + \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 2a & b \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} z+2a & b \\\\ 0 & z \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    RHS: $\\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 0 & -a \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    Equating terms: $z = -a$ and $z+2a = a \\implies a = -z$. Thus $a = -z$.\n    \n    Similarly, using $E_{11} \\circ E_{21} = \\frac{1}{2} E_{21}$, we find $p = -y$.\n    \n    Finally, using $E_{12} \\circ E_{21} = \\frac{1}{2}(E_{11} + E_{22}) = \\frac{1}{2}I$:\n    $D(E_{12}) \\circ E_{21} + E_{12} \\circ D(E_{21}) = D(\\frac{1}{2}I) = 0$.\n    This yields the relation $r = -b$.\n\n    **Summary of Derivation D:**\n    $D(E_{11}) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & y \\\\ z & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $D(E_{12}) = \\begin{pmatrix} -z & b \\\\ 0 & z \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $D(E_{21}) = \\begin{pmatrix} -y & 0 \\\\ -b & y \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $D(E_{22}) = -D(E_{11})$.\n    The derivation is completely determined by scalars $y, z, b$.\n\n5.  **Construction of Matrix $C$:**\n    We propose $D(X) = [C, X]$ where $C = \\begin{pmatrix} b/2 & -y \\\\ z & -b/2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    Note $C$ is traceless ($b/2 - b/2 = 0$).\n    Let's verify this $C$ produces the derivation above:\n    -   $[C, E_{11}] = \\begin{pmatrix} b/2 & -y \\\\ z & -b/2 \\end{pmatrix} E_{11} - E_{11} \\begin{pmatrix} b/2 & -y \\\\ z & -b/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} b/2 & 0 \\\\ z & 0 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} b/2 & -y \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & y \\\\ z & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. Matches.\n    -   $[C, E_{12}] = \\begin{pmatrix} b/2 & -y \\\\ z & -b/2 \\end{pmatrix} E_{12} - E_{12} C = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & b/2 \\\\ 0 & z \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} z & -b/2 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -z & b \\\\ 0 & z \\end{pmatrix}$. Matches.\n    -   $[C, E_{21}]$ similarly matches $\\begin{pmatrix} -y & 0 \\\\ -b & y \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n    Since $D$ and $[C, \\cdot]$ agree on the basis, $D(X) = CX - XC$ for all $X$.\n\n**Uniqueness:**\nSuppose $D(X) = CX - XC = C'X - XC'$ with $Tr(C) = Tr(C') = 0$.\nThen $[C-C', X] = 0$ for all $X \\in M_2(F)$.\nBy Schur's Lemma (or direct calculation), $C-C' = \\lambda I$ is a scalar matrix.\nTaking the trace: $Tr(C-C') = Tr(C) - Tr(C') = 0 - 0 = 0$.\n$Tr(\\lambda I) = 2\\lambda = 0$. Since $\\operatorname{char}(F) \\neq 2$, $\\lambda = 0$.\nThus $C = C'$.\n\n**Conclusion on Isomorphism:**\nThe map $\\Psi: \\mathfrak{sl}_2(F) \\to \\mathrm{Der}(J)$ defined by $C \\mapsto \\mathrm{ad}_C$ (where $\\mathrm{ad}_C(X) = [C, X]$) is:\n1.  Linear.\n2.  Injective (Kernel is trivial as shown by uniqueness).\n3.  Surjective (Every derivation has this form as shown by the classification).\n4.  A Lie algebra homomorphism: $[ \\mathrm{ad}_A, \\mathrm{ad}_B ] = \\mathrm{ad}_{[A,B]}$.\n\nTherefore, $\\mathrm{Der}(J) \\cong \\mathfrak{sl}_2(F)$.",

The class of the trivial bundle is $[\\mathbf{1}] = 1$.\nThus:\n$$ [T\\mathbb{C}P^n] = (n+1)[H] - 1. $$\nWe are given $\\eta = [H] - 1$, which implies $[H] = 1 + \\eta$. Substituting this into the equation:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n[T\\mathbb{C}P^n] &= (n+1)(1 + \\eta) - 1 \\\\\n&= (n+1) + (n+1)\\eta - 1 \\\\\n&= n + (n+1)\\eta.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n**Final Answer:**\n$$ [T\\mathbb{C}P^n] = n + (n+1)\\eta. $$",

        "answer": "Here is the complete and rigorous solution to the problem concerning the automorphism group of the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\n### Part 1: Action on Elements of Fixed Order\n\n**Claim:** Any automorphism $\\varphi \\in \\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)$ fixes $\\{1, -1\\}$ and permutes the set $S = \\{\\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k\\}$.\n\n**Proof:**\n1.  **Identity Element:** For any group homomorphism, the identity must map to the identity. Thus, $\\varphi(1) = 1$.\n2.  **Element Orders:** Automorphisms preserve the order of elements. If $x$ has order $n$, then $\\varphi(x)$ must have order $n$.\n    *   The orders of elements in $Q_8 = \\{\\pm 1, \\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k\\}$ are:\n        *   $o(1) = 1$\n        *   $o(-1) = 2$ (Since $(-1)^2 = 1$)\n        *   $o(\\pm i) = o(\\pm j) = o(\\pm k) = 4$ (Since $(\\pm i)^2 = -1 \\neq 1$ and $(\\pm i)^4 = 1$)\n3.  **Fixing $-1$:** The element $-1$ is the unique element of order 2 in $Q_8$. Since $\\varphi$ must map an element of order 2 to an element of order 2, we must have $\\varphi(-1) = -1$.\n4.  **Permuting Order 4 Elements:** The set of elements of order 4 is $S = \\{\\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k\\}$. Since $\\varphi$ is a bijection that preserves orders, it must map $S$ onto itself. Thus, $\\varphi$ permutes the six elements of order 4.\n\n---\n\n### Part 2: Determination and Size of $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)$\n\n**Claim:** An automorphism is uniquely determined by the images of $i$ and $j$, subject to specific constraints, and $|\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)| = 24$.\n\n**Proof:**\n1.  **Unique Determination:** The group $Q_8$ is generated by $i$ and $j$ (since $k = ij$). Since a homomorphism is uniquely determined by its action on a generating set, $\\varphi$ is determined by the pair $(\\varphi(i), \\varphi(j))$.\n\n2.  **Constraints on Images:**\n    Let $u = \\varphi(i)$ and $v = \\varphi(j)$. Since $\\varphi$ is an automorphism:\n    *   $u$ must be an element of order 4 (6 choices: $\\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k$).\n    *   $v$ must be an element of order 4.\n    *   For $i$ and $j$ to generate $Q_8$, $u$ and $v$ must generate $Q_8$. The subgroup generated by a single element of order 4, $\\langle u \\rangle = \\{1, u, -1, -u\\}$, has order 4. If $v \\in \\langle u \\rangle$, then $\\langle u, v \\rangle = \\langle u \\rangle \\neq Q_8$. Thus, it is necessary that $v \\notin \\langle u \\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Sufficiency of Constraints:**\n    We must verify that for any $u$ of order 4 and $v$ of order 4 with $v \\notin \\langle u \\rangle$, the map $i \\mapsto u, j \\mapsto v$ extends to a valid automorphism.\n    *   The defining relations are $i^2 = j^2 = (ij)^2 = -1$.\n    *   We check if $u^2 = v^2 = (uv)^2 = -1$.\n        *   Since $u, v$ have order 4, $u^2 = -1$ and $v^2 = -1$.\n        *   In $Q_8$, two elements of order 4 commute if and only if they are in the same cyclic subgroup (i.e., $v \\in \\langle u \\rangle$). Since $v \\notin \\langle u \\rangle$, $u$ and $v$ do not commute. In $Q_8$, non-commuting elements anticommute, so $vu = -uv$.\n        *   Then $(uv)^2 = uvuv = u(-uv)v = -u^2 v^2 = -(-1)(-1) = -1$.\n    *   The relations hold, so the homomorphism exists. Since the image $\\{u, v\\}$ generates $Q_8$, the homomorphism is surjective, and since $Q_8$ is finite, it is an automorphism.\n\n4.  **Counting:**\n    *   **Choices for $\\varphi(i)$:** There are 6 elements of order 4.\n    *   **Choices for $\\varphi(j)$:** For a fixed $u = \\varphi(i)$, the forbidden set is $\\langle u \\rangle = \\{\\pm 1, \\pm u\\}$, which contains 2 elements of order 4 ($\\pm u$). The total number of order 4 elements is 6. Thus, there are $6 - 2 = 4$ choices for $\\varphi(j)$.\n    *   **Total:** $|\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)| = 6 \\times 4 = 24$.\n\n---\n\n### Part 3: Inner Automorphisms and Action on Subgroups\n\n**Claim:** $\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8) \\cong V_4$, and there is a surjective homomorphism $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8) \\to S_3$ with kernel $\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8)$.\n\n**Proof:**\n1.  **Structure of $\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8)$:**\n    The inner automorphism group is given by $\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8) \\cong Q_8 / Z(Q_8)$.\n    *   The center is $Z(Q_8) = \\{1, -1\\}$.\n    *   The quotient has order $8/2 = 4$. The elements are represented by $\\{1, i, j, k\\}$.\n    *   Every non-identity element in $Q_8/\\{\\pm 1\\}$ has order 2 (e.g., $(i\\{\\pm 1\\})^2 = i^2\\{\\pm 1\\} = -1\\{\\pm 1\\} = \\{\\pm 1\\}$).\n    *   A group of order 4 with elementary abelian structure is the Klein four-group $V_4$.\n    *   Explicitly, $\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8) = \\{ \\operatorname{id}, c_i, c_j, c_k \\}$, where $c_x(g) = xgx^{-1}$.\n        *   $c_i$ fixes $i$, sends $j \\to -j, k \\to -k$.\n        *   $c_j$ fixes $j$, sends $i \\to -i, k \\to -k$.\n        *   $c_k$ fixes $k$, sends $i \\to -i, j \\to -j$.\n\n2.  **Action on Cyclic Subgroups:**\n    Let $X = \\{ \\langle i \\rangle, \\langle j \\rangle, \\langle k \\rangle \\}$ be the set of the three cyclic subgroups of order 4.\n    Consider the action of $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)$ on $X$. This defines a homomorphism $\\Psi: \\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8) \\to S_X \\cong S_3$.\n\n3.  **Kernel of $\\Psi$:**\n    An automorphism $\\varphi$ is in $\\ker \\Psi$ if it fixes every subgroup $\\langle i \\rangle, \\langle j \\rangle, \\langle k \\rangle$.\n    *   $\\varphi(\\langle i \\rangle) = \\langle i \\rangle \\implies \\varphi(i) \\in \\{\\pm i\\}$.\n    *   $\\varphi(\\langle j \\rangle) = \\langle j \\rangle \\implies \\varphi(j) \\in \\{\\pm j\\}$.\n    *   The inner automorphisms clearly satisfy this: e.g., $c_i(i)=i$, $c_i(j)=-j \\in \\langle j \\rangle$. Thus $\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8) \\subseteq \\ker \\Psi$.\n    *   We know $|\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8)| = 4$.\n    *   Consider any $\\varphi \\in \\ker \\Psi$. There are 2 choices for $\\varphi(i)$ ($\\pm i$) and 2 choices for $\\varphi(j)$ ($\\pm j$). Once these are chosen, $\\varphi$ is determined. Thus $|\\ker \\Psi| \\leq 4$.\n    *   Therefore, $\\ker \\Psi = \\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8)$.\n\n4.  **Surjectivity:**\n    By the First Isomorphism Theorem, $\\operatorname{Im} \\Psi \\cong \\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8) / \\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8)$.\n    *   $|\\operatorname{Im} \\Psi| = 24 / 4 = 6$.\n    *   Since $|S_3| = 6$, the map must be surjective.\n    *   Explicitly, we can cycle the subgroups (map $i \\to j \\to k$) or swap two (map $i \\to j, j \\to i, k \\to -k$).\n\n---\n\n### Part 4: Conclusion $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8) \\cong S_4$\n\n**Claim:** $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)$ is isomorphic to the symmetric group $S_4$.\n\n**Proof:**\nWe interpret $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)$ geometrically. The group $Q_8$ can be realized as the vertices of a generalized octahedron (or the directions of the axes in $\\mathbb{R}^3$: $\\pm \\mathbf{e}_1, \\pm \\mathbf{e}_2, \\pm \\mathbf{e}_3$).\n\n1.  **Geometric Action:**\n    Identify the elements $i, j, k$ with the standard basis vectors $\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}, \\mathbf{z}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The relation $ijk = -1$ corresponds to the fact that $(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}, \\mathbf{z})$ form a right-handed coordinate system (with appropriate sign convention).\n    Any automorphism $\\varphi$ permutes the set $\\{\\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k\\}$.\n    Because $\\varphi(-1) = -1$, $\\varphi(-x) = -\\varphi(x)$. Thus, $\\varphi$ is determined by its action on the three axes (lines generated by $i, j, k$).\n\n2.  **Correspondence to Rotations:**\n    The condition $\\varphi(ij) = \\varphi(k)$ ensures that the \"orientation\" of the basis is preserved. If we view these as rigid motions of the octahedron (vertices at $\\pm 1$ on each axis), $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)$ corresponds to the group of symmetries that map axes to axes and preserve the multiplicative structure (the right-hand rule).\n    This is exactly the group of **rotational symmetries of the octahedron** (or dually, the cube).\n\n3.  **Isomorphism:**\n    It is a standard result that the rotational symmetry group of the cube/octahedron is isomorphic to $S_4$.\n    *   The group acts on the 4 main diagonals of the cube.\n    *   The order of this symmetry group is 24.\n    *   Since $|\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)| = 24$ and it acts faithfully on the geometry of the orthogonal frame $\\{\\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k\\}$ preserving orientation, $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8) \\cong S_4$.\n\n**Algebraic Confirmation:**\nFrom Part 3, we established the exact sequence:\n$$ 1 \\to V_4 \\to \\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8) \\to S_3 \\to 1 $$\nThe action of the quotient $S_3$ on the normal subgroup $V_4 \\cong \\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8)$ (by conjugation) permutes the three non-identity elements $\\{c_i, c_j, c_k\\}$ transitively (as shown by the surjective map to $S_3$ on the corresponding subgroups). This is precisely the structure of $S_4$, which is the semi-direct product $V_4 \\rtimes S_3$ where $S_3$ acts faithfully on $V_4$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n$$ \\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8) \\cong S_4 $$",

The Center $Z(G)$\n\nThe center $Z(G)$ consists of all elements $g \\in G$ such that $gh = hg$ for all $h \\in G$.\nLet $g = (v, R_\\theta)$ be an element of the center.\nLet $h = (w, R_\\phi)$ be an arbitrary element of $G$.\n\nThe group operation is given by:\n$$ (v, R_\\theta)(w, R_\\phi) = (v + R_\\theta w, R_{\\theta+\\phi}) $$\n$$ (w, R_\\phi)(v, R_\\theta) = (w + R_\\phi v, R_{\\phi+\\theta}) $$\n\nSince $S^1$ is abelian, the rotational parts $R_{\\theta+\\phi}$ and $R_{\\phi+\\theta}$ are always equal.

Closed Connected Normal Subgroups\n\nSince $G$ is a Lie group, its closed connected normal subgroups correspond to the ideals of its Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$.\n\n**The Lie Algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$**\nThe Lie algebra of $G$ is the semi-direct product $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathbb{R}^2 \\rtimes \\mathfrak{so}(2)$.\nWe can represent elements of $\\mathfrak{g}$ as pairs $(u, A)$, where $u \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ and $A \\in \\mathfrak{so}(2)$. The Lie bracket is given by:\n$$ [(u, A), (w, B)] = (Aw - Bu, [A, B]) $$\nSince $\\mathfrak{so}(2)$ is abelian (1-dimensional), $[A, B] = 0$.

Since $\\mathfrak{n}$ is an ideal, $[(u, 0), (w, B)] \\in \\mathfrak{n}$.\n    $$ [(u, 0), (w, B)] = (0w - Bu, 0) = (-Bu, 0) $$\n    Since $B = \\alpha J$ with $\\alpha \\neq 0$, $B$ is a scaled rotation and is invertible. As $u$ varies over all of $\\mathbb{R}^2$, the term $-Bu$ covers all of $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n    Thus, $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\times \\{0\\} \\subseteq \\mathfrak{n}$.\n    Since $\\mathfrak{n}$ is a subspace, it also contains $(w, B) - (w, 0) = (0, B)$.

Properties of $f$\n\nFirst, we establish that $f$ is an even function.\nThe given equation is symmetric with respect to replacing $y$ with $-y$ on the right-hand side, since $(x+(-y)) = x-y$ and $(x-(-y)) = x+y$. Thus:\n$$ f(x)f(y) = f(x+y) + f(x-y) $$\n$$ f(x)f(-y) = f(x-y) + f(x+y) $$\nComparing these implies $f(x)f(y) = f(x)f(-y)$. Since $f(0)=2 \\neq 0$, there exists at least one $x$ (namely $x=0$) for which $f(x) \\neq 0$. Therefore, $f(y) = f(-y)$ for all $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$. So, $f$ is an even function.\n\nSince $f$ is even and differentiable on $\\mathbb{R}$, its derivative at zero is zero:\n$$ f'(0) = 0. $$\n(Proof: $f(x) = f(-x) \\implies f'(x) = -f'(-x)$. At $x=0$, $f'(0) = -f'(0) \\implies 2f'(0)=0 \\implies f'(0)=0$.)\n\n### 2. Deriving the Differential Equation\n\nSince $f$ is twice differentiable, we can differentiate the functional equation.\nDifferentiating the original equation with respect to $y$:\n$$ f(x)f'(y) = f'(x+y) \\cdot 1 + f'(x-y) \\cdot (-1) = f'(x+y) - f'(x-y). $$\nDifferentiating again with respect to $y$:\n$$ f(x)f''(y) = f''(x+y) \\cdot 1 - f''(x-y) \\cdot (-1) = f''(x+y) + f''(x-y). \\quad (*)$$\n\nNow, differentiate the original equation twice with respect to $x$:\nFirst derivative with respect to $x$:\n$$ f'(x)f(y) = f'(x+y) + f'(x-y). $$\nSecond derivative with respect to $x$:\n$$ f''(x)f(y) = f''(x+y) + f''(x-y). \\quad (**) $$\n\nObserving the right-hand sides of $(*)$ and $(**)$, we see they are identical ($f''(x+y) + f''(x-y)$). Therefore, the left-hand sides must be equal:\n$$ f(x)f''(y) = f''(x)f(y). $$\nSince $f(0)=2$, we can set $y=0$ in this relation to obtain:\n$$ f(x)f''(0) = f''(x)f(0) $$\n$$ f''(x) = \\frac{f''(0)}{f(0)} f(x) $$\n$$ f''(x) = \\frac{f''(0)}{2} f(x). $$\nLet $k = \\frac{f''(0)}{2}$. Since $f''(0)$ is a constant, $k$ is a real constant. Thus, $f$ must satisfy the second-order linear ordinary differential equation:\n$$ f''(x) - k f(x) = 0 $$\nsubject to the initial conditions $f(0) = 2$ and $f'(0) = 0$.\n\n### 3. Solving the Differential Equation\n\nWe analyze the solutions based on the sign of the constant $k$.\n\n**Case 1: $k = 0$**\nThe equation becomes $f''(x) = 0$.\nIntegrating twice, $f(x) = Ax + B$.\nUsing the initial conditions:\n$f(0) = B = 2$.\n$f'(0) = A = 0$.\nThus, **$f(x) = 2$**.\n\n**Case 2: $k > 0$**\nLet $k = \\lambda^2$ for some $\\lambda > 0$.

        "raw_answer": "To find all functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that are twice differentiable and satisfy the functional equation\n$$ f(x)f(y) = f(x+y) + f(x-y), \\quad f(0) = 2, $$\nwe proceed with the following derivation.\n\n### 1. Properties of $f$\n\nFirst, we establish that $f$ is an even function.\nThe given equation is symmetric with respect to replacing $y$ with $-y$ on the right-hand side, since $(x+(-y)) = x-y$ and $(x-(-y)) = x+y$. Thus:\n$$ f(x)f(y) = f(x+y) + f(x-y) $$\n$$ f(x)f(-y) = f(x-y) + f(x+y) $$\nComparing these implies $f(x)f(y) = f(x)f(-y)$. Since $f(0)=2 \\neq 0$, there exists at least one $x$ (namely $x=0$) for which $f(x) \\neq 0$. Therefore, $f(y) = f(-y)$ for all $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$. So, $f$ is an even function.\n\nSince $f$ is even and differentiable on $\\mathbb{R}$, its derivative at zero is zero:\n$$ f'(0) = 0. $$\n(Proof: $f(x) = f(-x) \\implies f'(x) = -f'(-x)$. At $x=0$, $f'(0) = -f'(0) \\implies 2f'(0)=0 \\implies f'(0)=0$.)\n\n### 2. Deriving the Differential Equation\n\nSince $f$ is twice differentiable, we can differentiate the functional equation.\nDifferentiating the original equation with respect to $y$:\n$$ f(x)f'(y) = f'(x+y) \\cdot 1 + f'(x-y) \\cdot (-1) = f'(x+y) - f'(x-y). $$\nDifferentiating again with respect to $y$:\n$$ f(x)f''(y) = f''(x+y) \\cdot 1 - f''(x-y) \\cdot (-1) = f''(x+y) + f''(x-y). \\quad (*)$$\n\nNow, differentiate the original equation twice with respect to $x$:\nFirst derivative with respect to $x$:\n$$ f'(x)f(y) = f'(x+y) + f'(x-y). $$\nSecond derivative with respect to $x$:\n$$ f''(x)f(y) = f''(x+y) + f''(x-y). \\quad (**) $$\n\nObserving the right-hand sides of $(*)$ and $(**)$, we see they are identical ($f''(x+y) + f''(x-y)$). Therefore, the left-hand sides must be equal:\n$$ f(x)f''(y) = f''(x)f(y). $$\nSince $f(0)=2$, we can set $y=0$ in this relation to obtain:\n$$ f(x)f''(0) = f''(x)f(0) $$\n$$ f''(x) = \\frac{f''(0)}{f(0)} f(x) $$\n$$ f''(x) = \\frac{f''(0)}{2} f(x). $$\nLet $k = \\frac{f''(0)}{2}$. Since $f''(0)$ is a constant, $k$ is a real constant. Thus, $f$ must satisfy the second-order linear ordinary differential equation:\n$$ f''(x) - k f(x) = 0 $$\nsubject to the initial conditions $f(0) = 2$ and $f'(0) = 0$.\n\n### 3. Solving the Differential Equation\n\nWe analyze the solutions based on the sign of the constant $k$.\n\n**Case 1: $k = 0$**\nThe equation becomes $f''(x) = 0$.\nIntegrating twice, $f(x) = Ax + B$.\nUsing the initial conditions:\n$f(0) = B = 2$.\n$f'(0) = A = 0$.\nThus, **$f(x) = 2$**.\n\n**Case 2: $k > 0$**\nLet $k = \\lambda^2$ for some $\\lambda > 0$. The equation is $f''(x) - \\lambda^2 f(x) = 0$.\nThe general solution is $f(x) = A e^{\\lambda x} + B e^{-\\lambda x}$.\n$f'(x) = A\\lambda e^{\\lambda x} - B\\lambda e^{-\\lambda x}$.\nUsing the initial conditions:\n$f(0) = A + B = 2$.\n$f'(0) = \\lambda(A - B) = 0 \\implies A = B$.\nSo $2A = 2 \\implies A = 1, B = 1$.\n$f(x) = e^{\\lambda x} + e^{-\\lambda x} = 2 \\cosh(\\lambda x)$.\nThus, **$f(x) = 2 \\cosh(\\lambda x)$**.\n\n**Case 3: $k < 0$**\nLet $k = -\\omega^2$ for some $\\omega > 0$.

The integral $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^{s-1}}{1+x^n} \\, dx$ converges if the power of $x$ is greater than $-1$ near $0$ (requiring $s-1 > -1 \\implies s > 0$) and if the power of $x$ is less than $-1$ near $\\infty$ (requiring $s-1-n < -1 \\implies s < n$). Thus, $J_n(s)$ is well-defined for $s \\in (0, n)$. Since $n \\ge 2$, the point $s=1$ lies strictly within this interval of convergence.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate $J_n(s)$\n\nWe evaluate $J_n(s)$ using the substitution $u = x^n$. Then $x = u^{1/n}$, which implies $dx = \\frac{1}{n} u^{\\frac{1}{n}-1} \\, du$. The limits of integration remain $0$ to $\\infty$.\n\nSubstituting these into the integral:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nJ_n(s) &= \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(u^{1/n})^{s-1}}{1+u} \\cdot \\frac{1}{n} u^{\\frac{1}{n}-1} \\, du \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{n} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{u^{\\frac{s-1}{n}} \\cdot u^{\\frac{1-n}{n}}}{1+u} \\, du \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{n} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{u^{\\frac{s}{n}-1}}{1+u} \\, du.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nWe recall the standard integral representation for the Beta function combined with Euler's reflection formula:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{t^{z-1}}{1+t} \\, dt = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi z)}, \\quad \\text{for } 0 < \\text{Re}(z) < 1.\n$$\nIn our case, $z = \\frac{s}{n}$. The condition $0 < z < 1$ corresponds to $0 < s < n$, which matches our domain of convergence. Thus:\n$$\nJ_n(s) = \\frac{1}{n} \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi s}{n}\\right)}.\n$$\n\n### Step 3: Differentiate with Respect to $s$\n\nNow we compute the derivative $J_n'(s)$ with respect to $s$:\n$$\nJ_n(s) = \\frac{\\pi}{n} \\csc\\left(\\frac{\\pi s}{n}\\right).\n$$\nUsing the chain rule and the derivative of cosecant ($\\frac{d}{dx}\\csc x = -\\csc x \\cot x$):\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nJ_n'(s) &= \\frac{\\pi}{n} \\cdot \\frac{d}{ds} \\left[ \\csc\\left(\\frac{\\pi s}{n}\\right) \\right] \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\pi}{n} \\left[ -\\csc\\left(\\frac{\\pi s}{n}\\right) \\cot\\left(\\frac{\\pi s}{n}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{d}{ds}\\left(\\frac{\\pi s}{n}\\right) \\right] \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\pi}{n} \\left[ -\\csc\\left(\\frac{\\pi s}{n}\\right) \\cot\\left(\\frac{\\pi s}{n}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{n} \\right] \\\\\n&= -\\frac{\\pi^2}{n^2} \\csc\\left(\\frac{\\pi s}{n}\\right) \\cot\\left(\\frac{\\pi s}{n}\\right).\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nRewriting in terms of sine and cosine:\n$$\nJ_n'(s) = -\\frac{\\pi^2}{n^2} \\frac{\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi s}{n}\\right)}{\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi s}{n}\\right)}.\n$$\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate at $s=1$\n\nFinally, we substitute $s=1$ to find $I_n$:\n$$\nI_n = J_n'(1) = -\\frac{\\pi^2}{n^2} \\frac{\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right)}{\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right)}.\n$$\n\n### Final Result\n\nThe closed-form expression for the integral is:\n$$\nI_n = -\\frac{\\pi^2}{n^2} \\frac{\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right)}{\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right)}\n$$",

Therefore, $u = v$ everywhere. The minimizer is unique.\n\n**Harmonicity:**\nLet $u_*$ be the minimizer. Let $\\phi \\in C_c^\\infty(\\Omega)$ be an arbitrary smooth test function with compact support in $\\Omega$. For any $\\epsilon \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the function $u_* + \\epsilon \\phi$ satisfies the boundary conditions, and since $u_* \\in C^1(\\overline{\\Omega})$, $u_* + \\epsilon \\phi \\in \\mathcal{A}$ (assuming $\\phi$ doesn't violate regularity, which it doesn't).\nDefine the function $g(\\epsilon) = E[u_* + \\epsilon \\phi]$.

The Laplace equation in radial coordinates for $n \\ge 3$ is:\n$$ \\Delta u_* = v''(r) + \\frac{n-1}{r} v'(r) = 0. $$\nThis is a separable ODE:\n$$ r^{n-1} v''(r) + (n-1)r^{n-2} v'(r) = 0 \\implies \\frac{d}{dr} (r^{n-1} v'(r)) = 0. $$\nIntegrating once:\n$$ r^{n-1} v'(r) = c_1 \\implies v'(r) = c_1 r^{1-n}. $$\nIntegrating again (since $n \\ge 3$, $1-n \\ne -1$):\n$$ v(r) = c_1 \\frac{r^{2-n}}{2-n} + c_2. $$\nLet $A = \\frac{c_1}{2-n}$ and $B = c_2$.

Geometric Setup and Connectivity**\nThe domain $D$ is defined as the union of two sets:\n$$ D = D_1 \\cup D_2 $$\nwhere $D_1 = \\{(z,w) \\in \\Delta^2 : |z| > r\\}$ and $D_2 = \\{(z,w) \\in \\Delta^2 : |w| < s\\}$.\nNote that $D_1$ is connected (an annulus times a disc) and $D_2$ is connected (a disc times a disc). Their intersection $D_1 \\cap D_2 = \\{(z,w) \\in \\Delta^2 : |z| > r \\text{ and } |w| < s\\}$ is non-empty. Therefore, $D$ is a connected open set.\nThis connectivity ensures that if a holomorphic extension $F$ to $\\Delta^2$ exists, it is unique by the Identity Theorem.\n\n**2. Power Series Representation**\nLet $f \\in \\mathcal{O}(D)$. For any fixed $z \\in \\Delta$ (where $\\Delta = \\{|z| < 1\\}$), consider the function $w \\mapsto f(z,w)$.\nNote that for any $z \\in \\Delta$, the point $(z, 0)$ is in $D$ because $|0| = 0 < s$. Since $D$ is open, there exists a neighborhood of $w=0$ where $f(z, w)$ is defined and holomorphic.\nThus, we can expand $f(z, w)$ in a Taylor series with respect to $w$ around $w=0$:\n$$ f(z, w) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n(z) w^n $$\nwhere the coefficients are given by\n$$ a_n(z) = \\frac{1}{n!} \\frac{\\partial^n f}{\\partial w^n}(z, 0). $$\nSince $f$ is holomorphic on $D$, its partial derivatives are also holomorphic on $D$. The set $\\Delta \\times \\{0\\}$ is a subset of $D$. Therefore, each coefficient $a_n(z)$ is a holomorphic function of $z$ on the entire unit disc $\\Delta$.\n\n**3. Convergence Analysis using Hartogs' Lemma Technique**\nWe define a candidate extension $F(z, w) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n(z) w^n$. We must show that this series converges uniformly on compact subsets of $\\Delta^2$.\n\nLet $K$ be an arbitrary compact subset of $\\Delta^2$. Then $K$ is contained in a closed polydisc $P = \\{(z,w) : |z| \\le R, |w| \\le \\rho\\}$ for some $R < 1$ and $\\rho < 1$.\nWe need to bound $|a_n(z)|$ for $|z| \\le R$.\n\nChoose a real number $r_0$ such that $\\max(r, R) < r_0 < 1$.\nChoose a real number $\\rho_0$ such that $\\rho < \\rho_0 < 1$.\n\nConsider the set $S = \\{(z,w) : |z| = r_0, |w| = \\rho_0\\}$.\nSince $|z| = r_0 > r$, the set $S$ is completely contained in $D_1$, and thus $S \\subset D$.\nSince $S$ is a compact subset of $D$, $|f(z,w)|$ is bounded on $S$. Let $M = \\sup_{(z,w) \\in S} |f(z,w)|$.\n\nBy the Cauchy Integral Formula (or Cauchy inequalities) applied to the variable $w$, for any fixed $z$ with $|z| = r_0$, we have:\n$$ |a_n(z)| \\le \\frac{\\sup_{|w|=\\rho_0} |f(z,w)|}{\\rho_0^n} \\le \\frac{M}{\\rho_0^n}. $$\n\nNow consider the function $a_n(z)$. It is holomorphic on $\\Delta$. By the **Maximum Modulus Principle**, the maximum absolute value of $a_n(z)$ on the disc $\\{|z| \\le r_0\\}$ is attained on the boundary $\\{|z| = r_0\\}$.\nTherefore, for all $z$ such that $|z| \\le r_0$:\n$$ |a_n(z)| \\le \\max_{|\\zeta|=r_0} |a_n(\\zeta)| \\le M \\rho_0^{-n}. $$\n\n**4. Uniform Convergence**\nSince $R < r_0$, the bound $|a_n(z)| \\le M \\rho_0^{-n}$ holds for all $z$ in our compact set projection $\\{|z| \\le R\\}$.\nNow consider the term $|a_n(z) w^n|$ for $(z,w) \\in P$:\n$$ |a_n(z) w^n| \\le M \\rho_0^{-n} \\cdot \\rho^n = M \\left( \\frac{\\rho}{\\rho_0} \\right)^n. $$\nSince we chose $\\rho_0 > \\rho$, the ratio $\\frac{\\rho}{\\rho_0} < 1$.\nTherefore, the series $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n(z) w^n$ converges uniformly on $P$ (and thus on $K$) by the Weierstrass M-test.\n\n**5. Conclusion of Part 1**\nThe uniform convergence on compact subsets implies that the function\n$$ F(z, w) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n(z) w^n $$\nis holomorphic on $\\Delta^2$.\nWe must verify that $F$ extends $f$.\nOn the set $D_2 = \\{(z,w) \\in \\Delta^2 : |w| < s\\}$, the series $\\sum a_n(z) w^n$ is exactly the Taylor series expansion of $f(z,w)$ (since $f$ is holomorphic there). Thus $F(z,w) = f(z,w)$ on $D_2$.\nSince $F$ and $f$ agree on the open set $D_2$ and $D$ is connected, by the Identity Theorem, $F(z,w) = f(z,w)$ for all $(z,w) \\in D$.\nThus, $F$ is the unique holomorphic extension of $f$ to $\\Delta^2$.\n\n***\n\n### Part 2: Envelope of Holomorphy\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nConclude that the envelope of holomorphy of $D$ (as a domain in $\\mathbb C^2$) is exactly $\\Delta^2$.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Extension to $\\Delta^2$:**\n    From Part 1, we have established that every holomorphic function on $D$ extends to $\\Delta^2$.

The integral $I(\\alpha, \\nu)$ can be viewed as the Mellin transform of the product $K_\\nu(x) \\cdot K_\\nu(x)$ evaluated at $s = \\alpha$.\n\nThe Mellin transform of a function $f(x)$ is defined as $\\mathcal{M}[f](s) = \\int_0^\\infty x^{s-1} f(x) \\, dx$. The known Mellin transform of the modified Bessel function of the second kind, $K_\\nu(x)$, is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{M}[K_\\nu(x)](s) = 2^{s-2} \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{s-\\nu}{2}\\right) \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{s+\\nu}{2}\\right),\n$$\nprovided $\\Re(s) > |\\Re(\\nu)|$.\n\n### 2. Application of Parseval's Identity\n\nBy the convolution theorem for Mellin transforms (Parseval's type identity), the Mellin transform of a product of two functions is given by a complex contour integral of the product of their Mellin transforms. Specifically:\n$$\n\\int_0^\\infty x^{\\alpha-1} f(x) g(x) \\, dx = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\int_{c-i\\infty}^{c+i\\infty} \\mathcal{M}[f](s) \\mathcal{M}[g](\\alpha-s) \\, ds.\n$$\nSetting $f(x) = g(x) = K_\\nu(x)$, we have:\n$$\nI(\\alpha,\\nu) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\int_{c-i\\infty}^{c+i\\infty} \\left[ 2^{s-2} \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{s-\\nu}{2}\\right) \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{s+\\nu}{2}\\right) \\right] \\left[ 2^{(\\alpha-s)-2} \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{\\alpha-s-\\nu}{2}\\right) \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{\\alpha-s+\\nu}{2}\\right) \\right] \\, ds.\n$$\nThe constant $c$ must be chosen such that the integration path lies within the common strip of convergence of the Mellin transforms. The poles of the first factor are at $s = \\pm \\nu - 2k$ (to the left), and the poles of the second factor are at $s = \\alpha \\pm \\nu + 2k$ (to the right), for $k=0,1,2,\\dots$.\nThe condition $\\Re(\\alpha) > 2|\\Re(\\nu)|$ ensures that there exists a vertical strip in the complex $s$-plane where the integral converges, separating the \"left\" poles from the \"right\" poles.\n\nCombining the power of 2 terms: $2^{s-2} \\cdot 2^{\\alpha-s-2} = 2^{\\alpha-4}$.\nThe integral becomes:\n$$\nI(\\alpha,\\nu) = \\frac{2^{\\alpha-4}}{2\\pi i} \\int_{c-i\\infty}^{c+i\\infty} \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{s-\\nu}{2}\\right) \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{s+\\nu}{2}\\right) \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{\\alpha-s-\\nu}{2}\\right) \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{\\alpha-s+\\nu}{2}\\right) \\, ds.\n$$\n\n### 3. Evaluation via Barnes Lemma\n\nWe perform a change of variables to align this with the standard form of the First Barnes Lemma. Let $z = s/2$, so $ds = 2 \\, dz$. The contour integral transforms to:\n$$\n\\int_{c-i\\infty}^{c+i\\infty} (\\dots) \\, ds = 2 \\int_{c'-i\\infty}^{c'+i\\infty} \\Gamma\\left(z - \\frac{\\nu}{2}\\right) \\Gamma\\left(z + \\frac{\\nu}{2}\\right) \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{\\alpha-\\nu}{2} - z\\right) \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{\\alpha+\\nu}{2} - z\\right) \\, dz.\n$$\nThe First Barnes Lemma states:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\int_{-i\\infty}^{i\\infty} \\Gamma(a+z)\\Gamma(b+z)\\Gamma(c-z)\\Gamma(d-z) \\, dz = \\frac{\\Gamma(a+c)\\Gamma(a+d)\\Gamma(b+c)\\Gamma(b+d)}{\\Gamma(a+b+c+d)}.\n$$\nIdentifying the parameters:\n$$\na = -\\frac{\\nu}{2}, \\quad b = \\frac{\\nu}{2}, \\quad c = \\frac{\\alpha-\\nu}{2}, \\quad d = \\frac{\\alpha+\\nu}{2}.\n$$\nWe calculate the sums of parameters required for the result:\n1. $a+c = -\\frac{\\nu}{2} + \\frac{\\alpha-\\nu}{2} = \\frac{\\alpha}{2} - \\nu$\n2. $a+d = -\\frac{\\nu}{2} + \\frac{\\alpha+\\nu}{2} = \\frac{\\alpha}{2}$\n3. $b+c = \\frac{\\nu}{2} + \\frac{\\alpha-\\nu}{2} = \\frac{\\alpha}{2}$\n4. $b+d = \\frac{\\nu}{2} + \\frac{\\alpha+\\nu}{2} = \\frac{\\alpha}{2} + \\nu$\n5. $a+b+c+d = 0 + \\alpha = \\alpha$\n\nSubstituting these into the Barnes Lemma formula and including the prefactors ($2^{\\alpha-4} \\times 2$):\n$$\nI(\\alpha,\\nu) = 2^{\\alpha-3} \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2} - \\nu\\right) \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right) \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right) \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2} + \\nu\\right)}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)}.\n$$\n\n### 4. Simplification\n\nWe can simplify this expression using the Legendre duplication formula for the Gamma function:\n$$\n\\Gamma(\\alpha) = \\frac{2^{\\alpha-1}}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right) \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{\\alpha+1}{2}\\right).\n$$\nSubstituting this into the denominator:\n$$\nI(\\alpha,\\nu) = 2^{\\alpha-3} \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)^2 \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2} - \\nu\\right) \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2} + \\nu\\right)}{\\frac{2^{\\alpha-1}}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right) \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{\\alpha+1}{2}\\right)}.\n$$\nCanceling common terms ($2^{\\alpha-3} / 2^{\\alpha-1} = 2^{-2} = 1/4$ and one $\\Gamma(\\alpha/2)$):\n$$\nI(\\alpha,\\nu) = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{4} \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right) \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2} - \\nu\\right) \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2} + \\nu\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{\\alpha+1}{2}\\right)}.\n$$\n\nThe condition $\\Re(\\alpha) > 2|\\Re(\\nu)|$ guarantees that all arguments of the Gamma functions in the numerator have positive real parts, ensuring the result is well-defined.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe exact closed-form evaluation of the integral is:\n\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} x^{\\alpha-1}\\,K_\\nu(x)^2\\,dx = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{4} \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right) \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2} - \\nu\\right) \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2} + \\nu\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{\\alpha+1}{2}\\right)}\n$$",

        "answer": "Here is the complete step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### Part 1: Prove that $m$ is $T$-invariant\n\nTo prove that the Haar measure $m$ (which corresponds to the Lebesgue measure on the torus $\\mathbb{T}^2$) is invariant under $T$, we must show that for any measurable set $E \\subseteq \\mathbb{T}^2$, $m(T^{-1}(E)) = m(E)$, or equivalently, that for any integrable function $f$, $\\int_{\\mathbb{T}^2} f(T(x)) \\, dm(x) = \\int_{\\mathbb{T}^2} f(x) \\, dm(x)$.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n1.  **Lift to $\\mathbb{R}^2$:** The map $T$ on the torus is induced by the linear map $L(x) = Ax$ on $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Let $\\mu$ denote the standard Lebesgue measure on $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n2.  **Jacobian Determinant:** The behavior of the Lebesgue measure under a linear transformation is governed by the absolute value of the determinant of the matrix. For a set $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^2$, $\\mu(A(S)) = |\\det(A)| \\mu(S)$.\n3.  **Matrix Property:** We are given $A = \\begin{pmatrix}2&1\\\\1&1\\end{pmatrix} \\in SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$. By definition of the special linear group $SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$, $\\det(A) = 1$. Thus, the linear map $L$ is area-preserving on $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n4.  **Quotient Space Argument:**\n    Let $f \\in C(\\mathbb{T}^2)$. We can regard $f$ as a $\\mathbb{Z}^2$-periodic function on $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The integral over the torus is the integral over a fundamental domain, typically the unit square $D = [0,1)^2$.\n    $$ \\int_{\\mathbb{T}^2} f(T([x])) \\, dm([x]) = \\int_D f(Ax) \\, d\\mu(x). $$\n    Consider the change of variables $y = Ax$. Since $\\det(A) = 1$, we have $d\\mu(y) = d\\mu(x)$.\n    The domain $D$ maps to $A(D)$, which is a parallelogram generated by the columns of $A$. Since $A \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, $A(D)$ is also a fundamental domain for the lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ (it has area 1 and integer vertices).\n    Because $f$ is periodic with respect to $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ and $\\mu$ is translation invariant, the integral of a periodic function over any fundamental domain of the period lattice is the same.\n    $$ \\int_D f(Ax) \\, d\\mu(x) = \\int_{A(D)} f(y) \\, d\\mu(y) = \\int_D f(y) \\, d\\mu(y) = \\int_{\\mathbb{T}^2} f \\, dm. $$\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSince $\\int f \\circ T \\, dm = \\int f \\, dm$ for all continuous functions, the measure $m$ is $T$-invariant.\n\n---\n\n### Part 2: Prove that $T$ is mixing with respect to $m$\n\nWe must show that for all $f, g \\in L^2(\\mathbb{T}^2, m)$:\n$$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\langle f \\circ T^n, g \\rangle = \\langle f, 1 \\rangle \\langle 1, g \\rangle, $$\nwhere $\\langle u, v \\rangle = \\int u \\bar{v} \\, dm$.\n\n**Reasoning:**\nIt suffices to prove this property for a dense subset of $L^2(\\mathbb{T}^2, m)$. The set of Fourier characters $\\{e_k\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2}$ forms an orthonormal basis, where $e_k(x) = e^{2\\pi i k \\cdot x}$ ($k \\cdot x$ denotes the dot product).\nUsing linearity, if the condition holds for basis elements, it holds for all trigonometric polynomials. Since trigonometric polynomials are dense in $L^2$, a standard approximation argument ($\\epsilon$-argument) extends the result to all $L^2$ functions.\n\n**Analysis of Characters:**\nLet $f = e_k$ and $g = e_l$ for $k, l \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2$.\n1.  **Compute the time evolution of a character:**\n    $$ (e_k \\circ T^n)(x) = e^{2\\pi i k \\cdot (A^n x)} = e^{2\\pi i ( (A^n)^T k ) \\cdot x} = e_{(A^n)^T k}(x). $$\n    Note that since $A$ is symmetric ($A_{12} = A_{21} = 1$), $(A^n)^T = A^n$. However, we will retain the transpose notation for generality.\n2.  **Evaluate the inner product:**\n    $$ \\langle e_k \\circ T^n, e_l \\rangle = \\int_{\\mathbb{T}^2} e_{(A^n)^T k}(x) \\overline{e_l(x)} \\, dm(x) = \\langle e_{(A^n)^T k}, e_l \\rangle. $$\n    By the orthonormality of the Fourier basis:\n    $$ \\langle e_p, e_q \\rangle = \\delta_{p,q} = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } p = q \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } p \\neq q \\end{cases}. $$\n    Thus, the term is non-zero (and equal to 1) only if $(A^n)^T k = l$.\n\n**Case Analysis:**\n*   **Case 1: $k = 0$.**\n    $f = e_0 = 1$ (the constant function).\n    $(A^n)^T 0 = 0$. So $\\langle 1 \\circ T^n, e_l \\rangle = \\langle 1, e_l \\rangle = \\delta_{0,l}$.\n    The RHS of the mixing condition is $\\langle 1, 1 \\rangle \\langle 1, e_l \\rangle = 1 \\cdot \\delta_{0,l}$.\n    The condition holds.\n\n*   **Case 2: $k \\neq 0$.**\n    The RHS of the mixing condition is $\\langle e_k, 1 \\rangle \\langle 1, e_l \\rangle = 0 \\cdot \\delta_{0,l} = 0$.\n    We must show that $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\langle e_{(A^n)^T k}, e_l \\rangle = 0$.\n    This happens if and only if for any fixed $l$, $(A^n)^T k \\neq l$ for all sufficiently large $n$. This is guaranteed if the orbit of $k$ under the dual map goes to infinity: $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\| (A^T)^n k \\| = \\infty$.\n\n    **Eigenvalue Analysis of $A$:**\n    The characteristic polynomial is $P(\\lambda) = \\det(A - \\lambda I) = \\lambda^2 - \\text{tr}(A)\\lambda + \\det(A) = \\lambda^2 - 3\\lambda + 1$.\n    The eigenvalues are:\n    $$ \\lambda_{1,2} = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}. $$\n    Let $\\lambda_1 = \\frac{3 + \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\approx 2.618$ and $\\lambda_2 = \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\approx 0.382$.\n    Note that $\\lambda_1 > 1$ and $0 < \\lambda_2 < 1$. The matrix $A$ is hyperbolic.\n    \n    The eigenvectors $v_1$ (for $\\lambda_1$) and $v_2$ (for $\\lambda_2$) span $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Any vector $k \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ can be written as $k = c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2$.\n    Applying $(A^T)^n = A^n$ (since $A$ is symmetric):\n    $$ A^n k = c_1 \\lambda_1^n v_1 + c_2 \\lambda_2^n v_2. $$\n    \n    We claim that for any non-zero integer vector $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2 \\setminus \\{0\\}$, the coefficient $c_1$ cannot be zero.\n    *Proof:* If $c_1 = 0$, then $k = c_2 v_2$, meaning $k$ is an eigenvector corresponding to $\\lambda_2$.\n    The eigenvector $v_2$ satisfies $(A - \\lambda_2 I)v_2 = 0$. The components $(x, y)$ satisfy $(2-\\lambda_2)x + y = 0$, implies slope $y/x = \\lambda_2 - 2 = \\frac{3-\\sqrt{5}}{2} - 2 = \\frac{-1-\\sqrt{5}}{2}$, which is irrational.\n    A vector $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2 \\setminus \\{0\\}$ has a rational slope (or is vertical/horizontal).

        "raw_answer": "Here is the complete step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### Part 1: Prove that $m$ is $T$-invariant\n\nTo prove that the Haar measure $m$ (which corresponds to the Lebesgue measure on the torus $\\mathbb{T}^2$) is invariant under $T$, we must show that for any measurable set $E \\subseteq \\mathbb{T}^2$, $m(T^{-1}(E)) = m(E)$, or equivalently, that for any integrable function $f$, $\\int_{\\mathbb{T}^2} f(T(x)) \\, dm(x) = \\int_{\\mathbb{T}^2} f(x) \\, dm(x)$.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n1.  **Lift to $\\mathbb{R}^2$:** The map $T$ on the torus is induced by the linear map $L(x) = Ax$ on $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Let $\\mu$ denote the standard Lebesgue measure on $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n2.  **Jacobian Determinant:** The behavior of the Lebesgue measure under a linear transformation is governed by the absolute value of the determinant of the matrix. For a set $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^2$, $\\mu(A(S)) = |\\det(A)| \\mu(S)$.\n3.  **Matrix Property:** We are given $A = \\begin{pmatrix}2&1\\\\1&1\\end{pmatrix} \\in SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$. By definition of the special linear group $SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$, $\\det(A) = 1$. Thus, the linear map $L$ is area-preserving on $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n4.  **Quotient Space Argument:**\n    Let $f \\in C(\\mathbb{T}^2)$. We can regard $f$ as a $\\mathbb{Z}^2$-periodic function on $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The integral over the torus is the integral over a fundamental domain, typically the unit square $D = [0,1)^2$.\n    $$ \\int_{\\mathbb{T}^2} f(T([x])) \\, dm([x]) = \\int_D f(Ax) \\, d\\mu(x). $$\n    Consider the change of variables $y = Ax$. Since $\\det(A) = 1$, we have $d\\mu(y) = d\\mu(x)$.\n    The domain $D$ maps to $A(D)$, which is a parallelogram generated by the columns of $A$. Since $A \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, $A(D)$ is also a fundamental domain for the lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ (it has area 1 and integer vertices).\n    Because $f$ is periodic with respect to $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ and $\\mu$ is translation invariant, the integral of a periodic function over any fundamental domain of the period lattice is the same.\n    $$ \\int_D f(Ax) \\, d\\mu(x) = \\int_{A(D)} f(y) \\, d\\mu(y) = \\int_D f(y) \\, d\\mu(y) = \\int_{\\mathbb{T}^2} f \\, dm. $$\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSince $\\int f \\circ T \\, dm = \\int f \\, dm$ for all continuous functions, the measure $m$ is $T$-invariant.\n\n---\n\n### Part 2: Prove that $T$ is mixing with respect to $m$\n\nWe must show that for all $f, g \\in L^2(\\mathbb{T}^2, m)$:\n$$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\langle f \\circ T^n, g \\rangle = \\langle f, 1 \\rangle \\langle 1, g \\rangle, $$\nwhere $\\langle u, v \\rangle = \\int u \\bar{v} \\, dm$.\n\n**Reasoning:**\nIt suffices to prove this property for a dense subset of $L^2(\\mathbb{T}^2, m)$. The set of Fourier characters $\\{e_k\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2}$ forms an orthonormal basis, where $e_k(x) = e^{2\\pi i k \\cdot x}$ ($k \\cdot x$ denotes the dot product).\nUsing linearity, if the condition holds for basis elements, it holds for all trigonometric polynomials. Since trigonometric polynomials are dense in $L^2$, a standard approximation argument ($\\epsilon$-argument) extends the result to all $L^2$ functions.\n\n**Analysis of Characters:**\nLet $f = e_k$ and $g = e_l$ for $k, l \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2$.\n1.  **Compute the time evolution of a character:**\n    $$ (e_k \\circ T^n)(x) = e^{2\\pi i k \\cdot (A^n x)} = e^{2\\pi i ( (A^n)^T k ) \\cdot x} = e_{(A^n)^T k}(x). $$\n    Note that since $A$ is symmetric ($A_{12} = A_{21} = 1$), $(A^n)^T = A^n$. However, we will retain the transpose notation for generality.\n2.  **Evaluate the inner product:**\n    $$ \\langle e_k \\circ T^n, e_l \\rangle = \\int_{\\mathbb{T}^2} e_{(A^n)^T k}(x) \\overline{e_l(x)} \\, dm(x) = \\langle e_{(A^n)^T k}, e_l \\rangle. $$\n    By the orthonormality of the Fourier basis:\n    $$ \\langle e_p, e_q \\rangle = \\delta_{p,q} = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } p = q \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } p \\neq q \\end{cases}. $$\n    Thus, the term is non-zero (and equal to 1) only if $(A^n)^T k = l$.\n\n**Case Analysis:**\n*   **Case 1: $k = 0$.**\n    $f = e_0 = 1$ (the constant function).\n    $(A^n)^T 0 = 0$. So $\\langle 1 \\circ T^n, e_l \\rangle = \\langle 1, e_l \\rangle = \\delta_{0,l}$.\n    The RHS of the mixing condition is $\\langle 1, 1 \\rangle \\langle 1, e_l \\rangle = 1 \\cdot \\delta_{0,l}$.\n    The condition holds.\n\n*   **Case 2: $k \\neq 0$.**\n    The RHS of the mixing condition is $\\langle e_k, 1 \\rangle \\langle 1, e_l \\rangle = 0 \\cdot \\delta_{0,l} = 0$.\n    We must show that $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\langle e_{(A^n)^T k}, e_l \\rangle = 0$.\n    This happens if and only if for any fixed $l$, $(A^n)^T k \\neq l$ for all sufficiently large $n$. This is guaranteed if the orbit of $k$ under the dual map goes to infinity: $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\| (A^T)^n k \\| = \\infty$.\n\n    **Eigenvalue Analysis of $A$:**\n    The characteristic polynomial is $P(\\lambda) = \\det(A - \\lambda I) = \\lambda^2 - \\text{tr}(A)\\lambda + \\det(A) = \\lambda^2 - 3\\lambda + 1$.\n    The eigenvalues are:\n    $$ \\lambda_{1,2} = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}. $$\n    Let $\\lambda_1 = \\frac{3 + \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\approx 2.618$ and $\\lambda_2 = \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\approx 0.382$.\n    Note that $\\lambda_1 > 1$ and $0 < \\lambda_2 < 1$. The matrix $A$ is hyperbolic.\n    \n    The eigenvectors $v_1$ (for $\\lambda_1$) and $v_2$ (for $\\lambda_2$) span $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Any vector $k \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ can be written as $k = c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2$.\n    Applying $(A^T)^n = A^n$ (since $A$ is symmetric):\n    $$ A^n k = c_1 \\lambda_1^n v_1 + c_2 \\lambda_2^n v_2. $$\n    \n    We claim that for any non-zero integer vector $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2 \\setminus \\{0\\}$, the coefficient $c_1$ cannot be zero.\n    *Proof:* If $c_1 = 0$, then $k = c_2 v_2$, meaning $k$ is an eigenvector corresponding to $\\lambda_2$.\n    The eigenvector $v_2$ satisfies $(A - \\lambda_2 I)v_2 = 0$. The components $(x, y)$ satisfy $(2-\\lambda_2)x + y = 0$, implies slope $y/x = \\lambda_2 - 2 = \\frac{3-\\sqrt{5}}{2} - 2 = \\frac{-1-\\sqrt{5}}{2}$, which is irrational.\n    A vector $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2 \\setminus \\{0\\}$ has a rational slope (or is vertical/horizontal). Thus, $k$ cannot be collinear with $v_2$.\n    \n    Therefore, $c_1 \\neq 0$.

Since $r_1 r_2 = -1$, $a \\neq 0$, and $r_2 = -1/a$.\n$$ c_1 = \\frac{-1/a}{-1/a - a} = \\frac{-1/a}{-(1+a^2)/a} = \\frac{1}{1+a^2}. $$\n$$ c_2 = 1 - c_1 = 1 - \\frac{1}{1+a^2} = \\frac{a^2}{1+a^2}. $$\nThus, the function is:\n$$ f(x) = \\frac{1}{1+a^2} e^{ax} + \\frac{a^2}{1+a^2} e^{-x/a} = \\frac{e^{ax} + a^2 e^{-x/a}}{1+a^2}. $$\nHere, $a$ can be any non-zero real number. (Note: $a$ and $-1/a$ generate the same function, corresponding to swapping the roots).\n\n### Step 4: Verification\n\nWe must ensure this family of functions satisfies the original functional equation for any $a \\neq 0$.\nLet $f(x) = \\frac{e^{ax} + a^2 e^{-x/a}}{1+a^2}$. Then $f'(x) = \\frac{a e^{ax} - a e^{-x/a}}{1+a^2}$.\n\nCompute the RHS $f(x)f(y) + f'(x)f'(y)$:\n$$ \\frac{(e^{ax} + a^2 e^{-x/a})(e^{ay} + a^2 e^{-y/a}) + (a e^{ax} - a e^{-x/a})(a e^{ay} - a e^{-y/a})}{(1+a^2)^2} $$\nLet $E_a(x) = e^{ax}$ and $E_{-a}(x) = e^{-x/a}$. The numerator is:\n$$ (E_a(x) + a^2 E_{-a}(x))(E_a(y) + a^2 E_{-a}(y)) + a^2(E_a(x) - E_{-a}(x))(E_a(y) - E_{-a}(y)) $$\nExpanding the first term:\n$$ E_a(x+y) + a^2 E_a(x)E_{-a}(y) + a^2 E_{-a}(x)E_a(y) + a^4 E_{-a}(x+y) $$\nExpanding the second term (multiplied by $a^2$):\n$$ a^2 [ E_a(x+y) - E_a(x)E_{-a}(y) - E_{-a}(x)E_a(y) + E_{-a}(x+y) ] $$\nSumming these, the cross terms $E_a(x)E_{-a}(y)$ and $E_{-a}(x)E_a(y)$ cancel out:\n$$ (1 + a^2) E_a(x+y) + (a^4 + a^2) E_{-a}(x+y) $$\n$$ = (1 + a^2) E_a(x+y) + a^2(1 + a^2) E_{-a}(x+y) $$\n$$ = (1 + a^2) [ E_a(x+y) + a^2 E_{-a}(x+y) ] $$\nDividing by the denominator $(1+a^2)^2$:\n$$ \\frac{(1+a^2) [ e^{a(x+y)} + a^2 e^{-(x+y)/a} ]}{(1+a^2)^2} = \\frac{e^{a(x+y)} + a^2 e^{-(x+y)/a}}{1+a^2} = f(x+y). $$\nThe equation is satisfied.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe solutions are the constant function $f(x)=1$ and the family of exponential functions derived above. Note that $f(x)=1$ is not a member of the exponential family (it would require $a \\to 0$ in a way that doesn't converge uniformly on $\\mathbb{R}$).\n\nThe complete set of solutions is:\n1. $f(x) = 1$\n2. $f(x) = \\frac{e^{ax} + a^2 e^{-x/a}}{1+a^2}$ for any $a \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$.\n\n(Note: For $a=1$ or $a=-1$, this yields $f(x) = \\cosh x$).\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe functions satisfying the conditions are:\n$$ f(x) = 1 $$\nand\n$$ f(x) = \\frac{e^{ax} + a^2 e^{-x/a}}{1+a^2} $$\nwhere $a$ is any non-zero real constant.",

The set $\\{0\\}$ has Lebesgue measure zero, so almost everywhere on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, $|m_j(\\xi)| \\leq 1$.\nSubstituting this bound into the integral:\n$$\n\\|R_j f\\|_{L^2}^2 \\leq \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} 1^2 \\cdot |\\widehat{f}(\\xi)|^2 \\, d\\xi = \\|\\widehat{f}\\|_{L^2}^2.\n$$\nApplying Plancherel's theorem again ($ \\|\\widehat{f}\\|_{L^2} = \\|f\\|_{L^2} $), we obtain:\n$$\n\\|R_j f\\|_{L^2} \\leq \\|f\\|_{L^2}.\n$$\nThus, $R_j$ is a bounded linear operator on the subspace $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ with operator norm bounded by 1.\n\n**2. Unique Extension:**\nSince $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ is dense in $L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ and $R_j$ is a bounded linear operator on $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R}^n)$, the Bounded Linear Transformation (BLT) Theorem guarantees that $R_j$ extends uniquely to a bounded linear operator on the entire space $L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n)$. This extension preserves the operator norm.\n\n**3. Computation of the Operator Norm:**\nThe operator norm of a Fourier multiplier operator $T_m$ on $L^2$ is exactly the $L^\\infty$ norm of the multiplier $m$.\n$$\n\\|R_j\\|_{L^2 \\to L^2} = \\|m_j\\|_{L^\\infty(\\mathbb{R}^n)}.\n$$\nWe have already established that $|m_j(\\xi)| \\leq 1$, so $\\|m_j\\|_\\infty \\leq 1$.\nTo show equality, consider the point $\\xi^{(0)} = e_j$ (the standard unit vector in the $j$-th direction). Then:\n$$\nm_j(e_j) = -i \\frac{1}{|e_j|} = -i.\n$$\nThus $|m_j(e_j)| = 1$. Since $m_j$ is continuous on $\\mathbb{R}^n \\setminus \\{0\\}$, the essential supremum of $|m_j|$ is indeed 1.\n\n**Conclusion for Part 1:**\nThe operator $R_j$ extends uniquely to a bounded linear operator on $L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ with operator norm:\n$$\n\\|R_j\\|_{L^2 \\to L^2} = 1.\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Part 2: Proof of $L^2$ Identities\n\nLet $f \\in L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n)$. We utilize the isometric property of the Fourier transform established by Plancherel's theorem.\n\n**Identity 1:** $\\sum_{j=1}^n \\|R_j f\\|_{L^2}^2 = \\|f\\|_{L^2}^2$\n\nProof:\nUsing Plancherel's theorem and the definition of $R_j$:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sum_{j=1}^n \\|R_j f\\|_{L^2}^2 &= \\sum_{j=1}^n \\|m_j \\widehat{f}\\|_{L^2}^2 \\\\\n&= \\sum_{j=1}^n \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} |m_j(\\xi)|^2 |\\widehat{f}(\\xi)|^2 \\, d\\xi.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nBy linearity of the integral (and the non-negativity of the integrands allowing the exchange of sum and integral), we have:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^n \\|R_j f\\|_{L^2}^2 = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^n |m_j(\\xi)|^2 \\right) |\\widehat{f}(\\xi)|^2 \\, d\\xi.\n$$\nWe compute the sum of the squared moduli of the multipliers for $\\xi \\neq 0$:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^n |m_j(\\xi)|^2 = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\left| -i \\frac{\\xi_j}{|\\xi|} \\right|^2 = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\frac{\\xi_j^2}{|\\xi|^2} = \\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^n \\xi_j^2}{|\\xi|^2} = \\frac{|\\xi|^2}{|\\xi|^2} = 1.\n$$\nThus, the integrand simplifies to $1 \\cdot |\\widehat{f}(\\xi)|^2$ almost everywhere.\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^n \\|R_j f\\|_{L^2}^2 = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} |\\widehat{f}(\\xi)|^2 \\, d\\xi = \\|\\widehat{f}\\|_{L^2}^2.\n$$\nBy Plancherel's theorem, $\\|\\widehat{f}\\|_{L^2}^2 = \\|f\\|_{L^2}^2$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^n \\|R_j f\\|_{L^2}^2 = \\|f\\|_{L^2}^2.\n$$\n\n**Identity 2:** $\\sum_{j=1}^n R_j^2 f = -f$\n\nProof:\nThe operator $R_j^2$ is the composition $R_j \\circ R_j$. In the Fourier domain, applying a multiplier $m_j$ twice corresponds to multiplication by $m_j(\\xi)^2$.\nThus, for any $f \\in L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n)$, the Fourier transform of the sum is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{F}\\left( \\sum_{j=1}^n R_j^2 f \\right)(\\xi) = \\sum_{j=1}^n m_j(\\xi)^2 \\widehat{f}(\\xi) = \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^n m_j(\\xi)^2 \\right) \\widehat{f}(\\xi).\n$$\nWe compute the sum of the squared multipliers for $\\xi \\neq 0$:\n$$\nm_j(\\xi)^2 = \\left( -i \\frac{\\xi_j}{|\\xi|} \\right)^2 = (-i)^2 \\frac{\\xi_j^2}{|\\xi|^2} = - \\frac{\\xi_j^2}{|\\xi|^2}.\n$$\nSumming over $j=1, \\dots, n$:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^n m_j(\\xi)^2 = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\left( - \\frac{\\xi_j^2}{|\\xi|^2} \\right) = - \\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^n \\xi_j^2}{|\\xi|^2} = - \\frac{|\\xi|^2}{|\\xi|^2} = -1.\n$$\nTherefore:\n$$\n\\mathcal{F}\\left( \\sum_{j=1}^n R_j^2 f \\right)(\\xi) = -1 \\cdot \\widehat{f}(\\xi) = \\widehat{-f}(\\xi).\n$$\nSince the Fourier transform is a bijection on $L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n)$, equality of the Fourier transforms implies equality of the functions in $L^2$:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^n R_j^2 f = -f.\n$$",

        "answer": "Here is the complete solution to the problem.\n\n### Part 1: Properties of the Operator $T$\n\nWe are given the operator $T: L^2(0,1) \\to L^2(0,1)$ defined by\n$$ (Tf)(x) = \\int_0^1 \\min(x,y)f(y) \\, dy. $$\nLet $K(x,y) = \\min(x,y)$ be the kernel of this integral operator.\n\n**1. Boundedness and Compactness**\nSince the domain $(0,1)$ is finite, a sufficient condition for an integral operator to be compact (and therefore bounded) is that its kernel $K$ belongs to $L^2((0,1)\\times(0,1))$. Such an operator is called a Hilbert-Schmidt operator.\n\nWe compute the $L^2$ norm of the kernel:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\|K\\|_{L^2}^2 &= \\int_0^1 \\int_0^1 |K(x,y)|^2 \\, dy \\, dx \\\\\n&= \\int_0^1 \\int_0^1 (\\min(x,y))^2 \\, dy \\, dx.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nWe split the inner integral at $y=x$:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\int_0^1 (\\min(x,y))^2 \\, dy &= \\int_0^x y^2 \\, dy + \\int_x^1 x^2 \\, dy \\\\\n&= \\left[ \\frac{y^3}{3} \\right]_0^x + \\left[ x^2 y \\right]_x^1 \\\\\n&= \\frac{x^3}{3} + x^2(1 - x) \\\\\n&= \\frac{x^3}{3} + x^2 - x^3 = x^2 - \\frac{2}{3}x^3.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nNow, integrating with respect to $x$:\n$$\n\\|K\\|_{L^2}^2 = \\int_0^1 \\left( x^2 - \\frac{2}{3}x^3 \\right) dx = \\left[ \\frac{x^3}{3} - \\frac{2}{3}\\frac{x^4}{4} \\right]_0^1 = \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{6}.\n$$\nSince $\\|K\\|_{L^2}^2 = \\frac{1}{6} < \\infty$, the operator $T$ is Hilbert-Schmidt. Therefore, $T$ is **bounded** and **compact**.\n\n**2. Self-adjointness**\nThe inner product on $H = L^2(0,1)$ is $\\langle f, g \\rangle = \\int_0^1 f(x)\\overline{g(x)} \\, dx$.\nThe adjoint $T^*$ of an integral operator with kernel $K(x,y)$ has the kernel $K^*(x,y) = \\overline{K(y,x)}$.\nHere, the kernel $K(x,y) = \\min(x,y)$ is real-valued and symmetric (i.e., $\\min(x,y) = \\min(y,x)$).\nThus, $K(x,y) = \\overline{K(y,x)}$, which implies $T = T^*$.\nTherefore, $T$ is **self-adjoint**.\n\n**3. Positivity**\nWe must show that $\\langle Tf, f \\rangle \\ge 0$ for all $f \\in L^2(0,1)$.\n$$\n\\langle Tf, f \\rangle = \\int_0^1 \\left( \\int_0^1 \\min(x,y) f(y) \\, dy \\right) \\overline{f(x)} \\, dx.\n$$\nWe use the integral representation of the kernel: $\\min(x,y) = \\int_0^1 \\mathbb{1}_{[0,x]}(t) \\mathbb{1}_{[0,y]}(t) \\, dt$, where $\\mathbb{1}_A$ is the indicator function of set $A$. Substituting this into the inner product:\n$$\n\\langle Tf, f \\rangle = \\int_0^1 \\int_0^1 \\left( \\int_0^1 \\mathbb{1}_{[0,x]}(t) \\mathbb{1}_{[0,y]}(t) \\, dt \\right) f(y) \\overline{f(x)} \\, dy \\, dx.\n$$\nSince the integrand is absolutely integrable, we can apply Fubini's theorem to swap the order of integration, moving the $dt$ integral to the outside:\n$$\n\\langle Tf, f \\rangle = \\int_0^1 \\left( \\int_0^1 \\mathbb{1}_{[0,x]}(t) \\overline{f(x)} \\, dx \\right) \\left( \\int_0^1 \\mathbb{1}_{[0,y]}(t) f(y) \\, dy \\right) \\, dt.\n$$\nNote that $\\mathbb{1}_{[0,x]}(t) = 1$ if $t \\le x$ (i.e., $x \\ge t$) and $0$ otherwise. Thus:\n$$\n\\int_0^1 \\mathbb{1}_{[0,x]}(t) \\overline{f(x)} \\, dx = \\int_t^1 \\overline{f(x)} \\, dx = \\overline{\\int_t^1 f(x) \\, dx}.\n$$\nLet $G(t) = \\int_t^1 f(y) \\, dy$. Then the expression becomes:\n$$\n\\langle Tf, f \\rangle = \\int_0^1 \\overline{G(t)} G(t) \\, dt = \\int_0^1 |G(t)|^2 \\, dt.\n$$\nSince $|G(t)|^2 \\ge 0$, we have $\\langle Tf, f \\rangle \\ge 0$.\nTherefore, $T$ is a **positive** operator.\n\n---\n\n### Part 2: Eigenvalues and Eigenfunctions\n\nWe seek solutions to the eigenvalue equation $Tf = \\lambda f$ with $\\lambda \\neq 0$ and $f \\in L^2(0,1)$, $f \\not\\equiv 0$.\n$$\n(Tf)(x) = \\int_0^x y f(y) \\, dy + x \\int_x^1 f(y) \\, dy = \\lambda f(x). \\quad (*)\n$$\n**Regularity:**\nSince $f \\in L^2(0,1)$, the integrals on the LHS are continuous functions of $x$. Thus, $\\lambda f(x)$ is continuous. Since $\\lambda \\neq 0$, $f$ must be continuous. If $f$ is continuous, the RHS of $(*)$ is differentiable. Bootstrapping this argument, $f$ is infinitely differentiable.\n\n**Deriving the Differential Equation:**\nDifferentiating $(*)$ with respect to $x$ using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and the product rule:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\lambda f'(x) &= \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\int_0^x y f(y) \\, dy \\right) + \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( x \\int_x^1 f(y) \\, dy \\right) \\\\\n&= x f(x) + \\left( 1 \\cdot \\int_x^1 f(y) \\, dy + x \\cdot (-f(x)) \\right) \\\\\n&= x f(x) + \\int_x^1 f(y) \\, dy - x f(x) \\\\\n&= \\int_x^1 f(y) \\, dy.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nDifferentiating a second time:\n$$\n\\lambda f''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\int_x^1 f(y) \\, dy \\right) = -f(x).\n$$\nThis gives the Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE):\n$$\n\\lambda f''(x) + f(x) = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad f''(x) + \\frac{1}{\\lambda} f(x) = 0.\n$$\nSince $T$ is positive and $\\lambda \\neq 0$, we must have $\\lambda > 0$. Let $\\omega = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\lambda}}$. The ODE is:\n$$ f''(x) + \\omega^2 f(x) = 0. $$\nThe general solution is:\n$$ f(x) = A \\sin(\\omega x) + B \\cos(\\omega x). $$\n\n**Boundary Conditions:**\nWe determine boundary conditions from the integral equation $(*)$ and its first derivative.\n1. Evaluate $(*)$ at $x=0$:\n   $$ \\lambda f(0) = \\int_0^0 y f(y) \\, dy + 0 \\cdot \\int_0^1 f(y) \\, dy = 0. $$\n   Since $\\lambda \\neq 0$, we have **$f(0) = 0$**.\n2. Evaluate the first derivative $\\lambda f'(x) = \\int_x^1 f(y) \\, dy$ at $x=1$:\n   $$ \\lambda f'(1) = \\int_1^1 f(y) \\, dy = 0. $$\n   Since $\\lambda \\neq 0$, we have **$f'(1) = 0$**.\n\n**Solving for Eigenvalues and Eigenfunctions:**\nUsing $f(0) = 0$:\n$$ f(0) = A \\sin(0) + B \\cos(0) = B = 0. $$\nSo $f(x) = A \\sin(\\omega x)$.\nNow, calculate $f'(x) = A \\omega \\cos(\\omega x)$. Using $f'(1) = 0$:\n$$ A \\omega \\cos(\\omega) = 0. $$\nFor a non-trivial solution ($f \\not\\equiv 0$), we require $A \\neq 0$. Also $\\lambda$ exists implies $\\omega \\neq 0$. Thus:\n$$ \\cos(\\omega) = 0. $$\nThe roots are $\\omega_n = \\left(n + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\pi$ for integers $n \\ge 0$.\nThe eigenvalues are:\n$$ \\lambda_n = \\frac{1}{\\omega_n^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(n + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 \\pi^2} = \\frac{4}{(2n+1)^2 \\pi^2}, \\quad n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots $$\nThe corresponding eigenfunctions are $f_n(x) = \\sin(\\omega_n x)$.\n\n**Normalization:**\nWe normalize $f_n$ to obtain an orthonormal family. We compute $\\|f_n\\|^2$:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\int_0^1 \\sin^2(\\omega_n x) \\, dx &= \\int_0^1 \\frac{1 - \\cos(2\\omega_n x)}{2} \\, dx \\\\\n&= \\left[ \\frac{x}{2} - \\frac{\\sin(2\\omega_n x)}{4\\omega_n} \\right]_0^1 \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\sin((2n+1)\\pi)}{4\\omega_n}.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nSince $\\sin((2n+1)\\pi) = 0$ for integer $n$, the norm squared is $1/2$.\nThe normalization constant is $\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n**Result for Part 2:**\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda_n = \\frac{4}{(2n+1)^2 \\pi^2}$ for $n=0,1,2,\\dots$.\nThe corresponding orthonormal eigenfunctions are $e_n(x) = \\sqrt{2} \\sin\\left(\\left(n + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\pi x\\right)$.\n\n---\n\n### Part 3: Spectrum and Operator Norm\n\n**Spectrum $\\sigma(T)$:**\nThe operator $T$ is a compact self-adjoint operator on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space.

Then $y^{*''}(x) = 6Ax - 2B$. The functional is:\n$$\nJ[y^*] = \\int_0^1 (6Ax - 2B)^2 \\, dx = 4 \\int_0^1 (3Ax - B)^2 \\, dx.\n$$\nExpanding the integrand:\n$$\n(3Ax - B)^2 = 9A^2x^2 - 6ABx + B^2.\n$$\nIntegrating term by term from 0 to 1:\n$$\n\\int_0^1 (9A^2x^2 - 6ABx + B^2) \\, dx = \\left[ 3A^2x^3 - 3ABx^2 + B^2x \\right]_0^1 = 3A^2 - 3AB + B^2.\n$$\nThus, $J[y^*] = 4(3A^2 - 3AB + B^2)$.\nNow we substitute back $A = p+q$ and $B = 2p+q$:\n$$\n3A^2 &= 3(p+q)^2 = 3(p^2 + 2pq + q^2) = 3p^2 + 6pq + 3q^2 \\\\\n-3AB &= -3(p+q)(2p+q) = -3(2p^2 + 3pq + q^2) = -6p^2 - 9pq - 3q^2 \\\\\nB^2 &= (2p+q)^2 = 4p^2 + 4pq + q^2\n$$\nSumming these terms inside the parentheses:\n$$\n3A^2 - 3AB + B^2 &= (3p^2 - 6p^2 + 4p^2) + (6pq - 9pq + 4pq) + (3q^2 - 3q^2 + q^2) \\\\\n&= p^2 + pq + q^2.\n$$\nTherefore, the minimum value is:\n$$\n\\min_{y\\in\\mathcal{A}}J[y] = 4(p^2 + pq + q^2).\n$$\n\n---\n\n### 3. Proof of Unique Global Minimality\n\nWe prove that $y^*(x)$ is the unique global minimizer on $\\mathcal{A}$.\n\nLet $y \\in \\mathcal{A}$ be any admissible function. We can write $y(x) = y^*(x) + h(x)$, where $h(x) = y(x) - y^*(x)$.\nSince both $y$ and $y^*$ are in $\\mathcal{A}$, the perturbation $h$ must satisfy homogeneous boundary conditions:\n$$\nh(0) = y(0) - y^*(0) = 0, \\quad h(1) = y(1) - y^*(1) = 0,\n$$\n$$\nh'(0) = y'(0) - y^{*'}(0) = p - p = 0, \\quad h'(1) = y'(1) - y^{*'}(1) = q - q = 0.\n$$\nAlso, since $y, y^* \\in C^2([0,1])$, we have $h \\in C^2([0,1])$.\n\nNow, substitute $y = y^* + h$ into the functional $J$:\n$$\nJ[y^* + h] = \\int_0^1 (y^{*''} + h'')^2 \\, dx = \\int_0^1 (y^{*''})^2 \\, dx + 2 \\int_0^1 y^{*''} h'' \\, dx + \\int_0^1 (h'')^2 \\, dx.\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\nJ[y] = J[y^*] + 2 \\int_0^1 y^{*''} h'' \\, dx + J[h].\n$$\nWe analyze the middle term (the first variation) using integration by parts. Let $u = y^{*''}$ and $dv = h'' dx$. Then $du = y^{*'''} dx$ and $v = h'$.\n$$\n\\int_0^1 y^{*''} h'' \\, dx = \\left[ y^{*''} h' \\right]_0^1 - \\int_0^1 y^{*'''} h' \\, dx.\n$$\nSince $h'(0) = 0$ and $h'(1) = 0$, the boundary term $\\left[ y^{*''} h' \\right]_0^1$ vanishes.\nThe remaining integral is $-\\int_0^1 y^{*'''} h' \\, dx$.

        "raw_answer": "Here is the complete solution to the minimization problem.\n\n### 1. The Unique Minimizer $y^*(x)$\n\nWe seek to minimize the functional\n$$\nJ[y] = \\int_0^1 (y''(x))^2 \\, dx\n$$\nover the admissible set\n$$\n\\mathcal{A} = \\left\\{ y \\in C^2([0,1]) : y(0)=0, y(1)=0, y'(0)=p, y'(1)=q \\right\\}.\n$$\n\nA necessary condition for a function $y \\in \\mathcal{A}$ to be an extremum is that it satisfies the Euler-Lagrange equation associated with the Lagrangian $L(x, y, y', y'') = (y'')^2$. For functionals depending on second derivatives, the Euler-Lagrange equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y} - \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y'}\\right) + \\frac{d^2}{dx^2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y''}\\right) = 0.\n$$\nSubstituting the derivatives of $L$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y} = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y'} = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y''} = 2y''.\n$$\nThe equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2}{dx^2}(2y'') = 0 \\implies 2y^{(4)}(x) = 0 \\implies y^{(4)}(x) = 0.\n$$\nThus, the minimizer must be a polynomial of degree at most 3:\n$$\ny(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d.\n$$\nWe determine the coefficients $a, b, c, d$ using the four boundary conditions defining $\\mathcal{A}$.\n\n1.  **Condition $y(0) = 0$:**\n    $$ y(0) = a(0)^3 + b(0)^2 + c(0) + d = d \\implies d = 0. $$\n    So, $y(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx$.\n\n2.  **Condition $y'(0) = p$:**\n    Compute $y'(x) = 3ax^2 + 2bx + c$.\n    $$ y'(0) = c = p. $$\n    So, $y(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + px$.\n\n3.  **Condition $y(1) = 0$:**\n    $$ y(1) = a + b + p = 0 \\implies a + b = -p. \\quad (*)$$\n\n4.  **Condition $y'(1) = q$:**\n    $$ y'(1) = 3a + 2b + p = q \\implies 3a + 2b = q - p. \\quad (**)$$\n\nWe solve the linear system formed by $(*)$ and $(**)$ for $a$ and $b$. From $(*)$, we have $b = -a - p$. Substituting into $(**)$:\n$$\n3a + 2(-a - p) = q - p\n$$\n$$\n3a - 2a - 2p = q - p\n$$\n$$\na = q + p.\n$$\nThen, substituting $a$ back into the expression for $b$:\n$$\nb = -(q + p) - p = -q - 2p.\n$$\nSubstituting these coefficients into the polynomial form yields the unique minimizer:\n$$\ny^*(x) = (p+q)x^3 - (2p+q)x^2 + px.\n$$\n\n---\n\n### 2. The Minimum Value\n\nWe calculate $J[y^*]$ by substituting $y^*(x)$ into the functional.\nFirst, compute the second derivative $y^{*''}(x)$:\n$$\ny^{*'}(x) = 3(p+q)x^2 - 2(2p+q)x + p\n$$\n$$\ny^{*''}(x) = 6(p+q)x - 2(2p+q).\n$$\nFor notation, let $A = p+q$ and $B = 2p+q$. Then $y^{*''}(x) = 6Ax - 2B$. The functional is:\n$$\nJ[y^*] = \\int_0^1 (6Ax - 2B)^2 \\, dx = 4 \\int_0^1 (3Ax - B)^2 \\, dx.\n$$\nExpanding the integrand:\n$$\n(3Ax - B)^2 = 9A^2x^2 - 6ABx + B^2.\n$$\nIntegrating term by term from 0 to 1:\n$$\n\\int_0^1 (9A^2x^2 - 6ABx + B^2) \\, dx = \\left[ 3A^2x^3 - 3ABx^2 + B^2x \\right]_0^1 = 3A^2 - 3AB + B^2.\n$$\nThus, $J[y^*] = 4(3A^2 - 3AB + B^2)$.\nNow we substitute back $A = p+q$ and $B = 2p+q$:\n\\begin{align*}\n3A^2 &= 3(p+q)^2 = 3(p^2 + 2pq + q^2) = 3p^2 + 6pq + 3q^2 \\\\\n-3AB &= -3(p+q)(2p+q) = -3(2p^2 + 3pq + q^2) = -6p^2 - 9pq - 3q^2 \\\\\nB^2 &= (2p+q)^2 = 4p^2 + 4pq + q^2\n\\end{align*}\nSumming these terms inside the parentheses:\n\\begin{align*}\n3A^2 - 3AB + B^2 &= (3p^2 - 6p^2 + 4p^2) + (6pq - 9pq + 4pq) + (3q^2 - 3q^2 + q^2) \\\\\n&= p^2 + pq + q^2.\n\\end{align*}\nTherefore, the minimum value is:\n$$\n\\min_{y\\in\\mathcal{A}}J[y] = 4(p^2 + pq + q^2).\n$$\n\n---\n\n### 3.

We can write $y(x) = y^*(x) + h(x)$, where $h(x) = y(x) - y^*(x)$.\nSince both $y$ and $y^*$ are in $\\mathcal{A}$, the perturbation $h$ must satisfy homogeneous boundary conditions:\n$$\nh(0) = y(0) - y^*(0) = 0, \\quad h(1) = y(1) - y^*(1) = 0,\n$$\n$$\nh'(0) = y'(0) - y^{*'}(0) = p - p = 0, \\quad h'(1) = y'(1) - y^{*'}(1) = q - q = 0.\n$$\nAlso, since $y, y^* \\in C^2([0,1])$, we have $h \\in C^2([0,1])$.\n\nNow, substitute $y = y^* + h$ into the functional $J$:\n$$\nJ[y^* + h] = \\int_0^1 (y^{*''} + h'')^2 \\, dx = \\int_0^1 (y^{*''})^2 \\, dx + 2 \\int_0^1 y^{*''} h'' \\, dx + \\int_0^1 (h'')^2 \\, dx.\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\nJ[y] = J[y^*] + 2 \\int_0^1 y^{*''} h'' \\, dx + J[h].\n$$\nWe analyze the middle term (the first variation) using integration by parts. Let $u = y^{*''}$ and $dv = h'' dx$. Then $du = y^{*'''} dx$ and $v = h'$.\n$$\n\\int_0^1 y^{*''} h'' \\, dx = \\left[ y^{*''} h' \\right]_0^1 - \\int_0^1 y^{*'''} h' \\, dx.\n$$\nSince $h'(0) = 0$ and $h'(1) = 0$, the boundary term $\\left[ y^{*''} h' \\right]_0^1$ vanishes.\nThe remaining integral is $-\\int_0^1 y^{*'''} h' \\, dx$.

Let $Q = [0, 1)^n$ be the fundamental domain of the lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^n$. Every $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ can be uniquely written as $x = z + u$, where $z \\in Q$ and $u \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n$. Using this decomposition:\n$$\n\\operatorname{vol}(S) = \\sum_{u \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n} \\int_{Q + u} \\chi_S(x) \\, dx.\n$$\nApplying the change of variables $x = z + u$ (where $dx = dz$) to each integral:\n$$\n\\operatorname{vol}(S) = \\sum_{u \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n} \\int_{Q} \\chi_S(z + u) \\, dz = \\int_{Q} \\left( \\sum_{u \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n} \\chi_S(z + u) \\right) dz.\n$$\nLet $h(z) = \\sum_{u \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n} \\chi_S(z + u)$.

Thus, there exists a point $z_0 \\in Q$ such that $h(z_0) > 1$.\n\nSince $h(z_0)$ counts the number of lattice translates $u$ such that $z_0 + u \\in S$, and $h(z_0)$ is an integer, we must have $h(z_0) \\ge 2$.

We are given that $X$ is a locally compact, non-compact Hausdorff space.\n\n**1. Hausdorff Property**\n\nWe must show that for any distinct points $p, q \\in \\alpha X$, there exist disjoint open sets $U, V \\in \\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$ such that $p \\in U$ and $q \\in V$.\n\n**Case 1: $p, q \\in X$.**\nSince $X$ is Hausdorff, there exist disjoint open sets $U, V \\in \\mathcal{T}_X$ such that $p \\in U$ and $q \\in V$. By the definition of $\\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$, any open set in $X$ is open in $\\alpha X$. Thus, $U$ and $V$ separate $p$ and $q$ in $\\alpha X$.\n\n**Case 2: One point is $\\infty$.**\nWithout loss of generality, let $q = \\infty$ and $p \\in X$.\nSince $X$ is locally compact and Hausdorff, there exists an open neighborhood $U \\subseteq X$ of $p$ such that its closure $\\overline{U}$ (taken in $X$) is compact.\nLet $K = \\overline{U}$. Since $X$ is Hausdorff, the compact set $K$ is closed in $X$.\nDefine $V = \\alpha X \\setminus K$.\n- **$p \\in U$:** By construction.\n- **$\\infty \\in V$:** Since $K \\subseteq X$, $\\infty \\notin K$, so $\\infty \\in V$.\n- **$U$ is open:** $U \\in \\mathcal{T}_X \\implies U \\in \\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$.\n- **$V$ is open:** $V$ is the complement of the compact set $K \\subseteq X$, satisfying the definition of open neighborhoods of $\\infty$.\n- **Disjointness:** $U \\subseteq K$, so $U \\cap (\\alpha X \\setminus K) = \\emptyset$. Thus $U \\cap V = \\emptyset$.\n\nTherefore, $\\alpha X$ is Hausdorff.\n\n**2. Compactness**\n\nWe must show that every open cover of $\\alpha X$ has a finite subcover.\nLet $\\mathcal{U} = \\{U_i\\}_{i \\in I}$ be an open cover of $\\alpha X$.\n\n1. Since $\\infty \\in \\alpha X$, there exists some index $i_0 \\in I$ such that $\\infty \\in U_{i_0}$.\n2. By the definition of the topology on $\\alpha X$, since $\\infty \\in U_{i_0}$, there exists a compact set $K \\subseteq X$ such that $U_{i_0} = \\alpha X \\setminus K$.\n3. The collection $\\mathcal{U}$ covers $\\alpha X$, so it specifically covers $K$. For each $i \\in I$, let $V_i = U_i \\cap X$. Since $X$ is open in $\\alpha X$, each $V_i$ is open in $X$.\n4. The family $\\{V_i\\}_{i \\in I}$ is an open cover of the compact set $K$ in $X$.\n5. By the compactness of $K$, there exists a finite subset $J \\subseteq I$ such that $K \\subseteq \\bigcup_{j \\in J} V_j$.\n6. Since $V_j \\subseteq U_j$, we have $K \\subseteq \\bigcup_{j \\in J} U_j$.\n7.

As $X$ is a subspace of $\\alpha X$, $X$ is metrizable.\n\n2.  **$X$ is $\\sigma$-compact:**\n    Since $\\alpha X$ is metrizable, it is first-countable. Therefore, there exists a countable local base at $\\infty$, denoted by $\\{B_n\\}_{n=1}^\\infty$.\n    By the definition of the topology, for each $n$, there exists a compact set $K_n \\subseteq X$ such that $B_n = \\alpha X \\setminus K_n$.\n    \n    We claim that $X = \\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty K_n$.\n    Suppose for contradiction that there exists $x \\in X$ such that $x \\notin \\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty K_n$.\n    Then $x \\notin K_n$ implies $x \\in \\alpha X \\setminus K_n = B_n$ for all $n$. Thus, $x \\in \\bigcap_{n=1}^\\infty B_n$.\n    Consider the set $W = \\alpha X \\setminus \\{x\\}$. Since $\\alpha X$ is Hausdorff, $\\{x\\}$ is closed, so $W$ is an open neighborhood of $\\infty$.\n    By the definition of a local base, there must exist some $m$ such that $B_m \\subseteq W$.\n    However, $x \\in B_m$ (from above) but $x \\notin W$ (by definition of $W$). This is a contradiction ($x \\in B_m \\implies x \\in W$).\n    \n    Thus, $X = \\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty K_n$. Since each $K_n$ is compact, $X$ is $\\sigma$-compact.\n\n#### Direction $(\\Leftarrow)$: Assume $X$ is metrizable and $\\sigma$-compact.\n\nWe know from Part 1 that $\\alpha X$ is a compact Hausdorff space. To prove it is metrizable, it suffices to show that $\\alpha X$ is second-countable.\n\n1.  **$X$ is second-countable:**\n    Since $X$ is $\\sigma$-compact, we can write $X = \\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty K_n$ where each $K_n$ is compact.\n    Since $X$ is metrizable, each subspace $K_n$ is a compact metric space. A compact metric space is separable (has a countable dense subset).\n    The countable union of separable spaces is separable. Thus, $X$ is a separable metric space.\n    For metric spaces, separability implies second-countability. Let $\\mathcal{B}_X$ be a countable basis for the topology of $X$.\n\n2.  **Constructing a countable basis for $\\alpha X$:**\n    Since $X$ is a locally compact, $\\sigma$-compact Hausdorff space, it admits an **exhaustion by compact sets**. That is, there exists a sequence of compact sets $\\{C_n\\}_{n=1}^\\infty$ such that $C_n \\subseteq \\text{int}(C_{n+1})$ and $X = \\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty C_n$.\n    *(Construction sketch: Let $X = \\bigcup K_n$. Let $C_1 = K_1$. Inductively, since $C_n$ is compact and $X$ locally compact, there is an open set $V$ with $\\overline{V}$ compact such that $C_n \\subseteq V$. Let $C_{n+1} = K_{n+1} \\cup \\overline{V}$.)*\n\n    Define the collection $\\mathcal{V} = \\{ V_n \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\}$ where $V_n = \\alpha X \\setminus C_n$. Each $V_n$ is an open neighborhood of $\\infty$.\n    \n    Consider the collection $\\mathcal{B} = \\mathcal{B}_X \\cup \\mathcal{V}$. Since $\\mathcal{B}_X$ and $\\mathcal{V}$ are countable, $\\mathcal{B}$ is countable.

        "raw_answer": "Here is the complete and rigorous solution to the problem.\n\n### Part 1: Prove that $\\alpha X$ is compact and Hausdorff\n\nLet $\\mathcal{T}_X$ denote the topology of $X$ and $\\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$ denote the topology of $\\alpha X$. We are given that $X$ is a locally compact, non-compact Hausdorff space.\n\n**1. Hausdorff Property**\n\nWe must show that for any distinct points $p, q \\in \\alpha X$, there exist disjoint open sets $U, V \\in \\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$ such that $p \\in U$ and $q \\in V$.\n\n**Case 1: $p, q \\in X$.**\nSince $X$ is Hausdorff, there exist disjoint open sets $U, V \\in \\mathcal{T}_X$ such that $p \\in U$ and $q \\in V$. By the definition of $\\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$, any open set in $X$ is open in $\\alpha X$. Thus, $U$ and $V$ separate $p$ and $q$ in $\\alpha X$.\n\n**Case 2: One point is $\\infty$.**\nWithout loss of generality, let $q = \\infty$ and $p \\in X$.\nSince $X$ is locally compact and Hausdorff, there exists an open neighborhood $U \\subseteq X$ of $p$ such that its closure $\\overline{U}$ (taken in $X$) is compact.\nLet $K = \\overline{U}$. Since $X$ is Hausdorff, the compact set $K$ is closed in $X$.\nDefine $V = \\alpha X \\setminus K$.\n- **$p \\in U$:** By construction.\n- **$\\infty \\in V$:** Since $K \\subseteq X$, $\\infty \\notin K$, so $\\infty \\in V$.\n- **$U$ is open:** $U \\in \\mathcal{T}_X \\implies U \\in \\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$.\n- **$V$ is open:** $V$ is the complement of the compact set $K \\subseteq X$, satisfying the definition of open neighborhoods of $\\infty$.\n- **Disjointness:** $U \\subseteq K$, so $U \\cap (\\alpha X \\setminus K) = \\emptyset$. Thus $U \\cap V = \\emptyset$.\n\nTherefore, $\\alpha X$ is Hausdorff.\n\n**2. Compactness**\n\nWe must show that every open cover of $\\alpha X$ has a finite subcover.\nLet $\\mathcal{U} = \\{U_i\\}_{i \\in I}$ be an open cover of $\\alpha X$.\n\n1. Since $\\infty \\in \\alpha X$, there exists some index $i_0 \\in I$ such that $\\infty \\in U_{i_0}$.\n2. By the definition of the topology on $\\alpha X$, since $\\infty \\in U_{i_0}$, there exists a compact set $K \\subseteq X$ such that $U_{i_0} = \\alpha X \\setminus K$.\n3. The collection $\\mathcal{U}$ covers $\\alpha X$, so it specifically covers $K$. For each $i \\in I$, let $V_i = U_i \\cap X$. Since $X$ is open in $\\alpha X$, each $V_i$ is open in $X$.\n4. The family $\\{V_i\\}_{i \\in I}$ is an open cover of the compact set $K$ in $X$.\n5. By the compactness of $K$, there exists a finite subset $J \\subseteq I$ such that $K \\subseteq \\bigcup_{j \\in J} V_j$.\n6. Since $V_j \\subseteq U_j$, we have $K \\subseteq \\bigcup_{j \\in J} U_j$.\n7. Combining this with $U_{i_0}$, we see that $\\alpha X = (\\alpha X \\setminus K) \\cup K \\subseteq U_{i_0} \\cup \\bigcup_{j \\in J} U_j$.\n\nThus, $\\{U_{i_0}\\} \\cup \\{U_j\\}_{j \\in J}$ is a finite subcover of $\\alpha X$. Therefore, $\\alpha X$ is compact.\n\n---\n\n### Part 2: Prove $\\alpha X$ is metrizable $\\iff$ $X$ is metrizable and $\\sigma$-compact\n\nWe use the standard theorem that a compact Hausdorff space is metrizable if and only if it is second-countable (i.e., has a countable basis).\n\n#### Direction $(\\Rightarrow)$: Assume $\\alpha X$ is metrizable.\n\n1.  **$X$ is metrizable:**\n    Since $\\alpha X$ is a metrizable space, any subspace must also be metrizable. As $X$ is a subspace of $\\alpha X$, $X$ is metrizable.\n\n2.  **$X$ is $\\sigma$-compact:**\n    Since $\\alpha X$ is metrizable, it is first-countable. Therefore, there exists a countable local base at $\\infty$, denoted by $\\{B_n\\}_{n=1}^\\infty$.\n    By the definition of the topology, for each $n$, there exists a compact set $K_n \\subseteq X$ such that $B_n = \\alpha X \\setminus K_n$.\n    \n    We claim that $X = \\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty K_n$.\n    Suppose for contradiction that there exists $x \\in X$ such that $x \\notin \\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty K_n$.\n    Then $x \\notin K_n$ implies $x \\in \\alpha X \\setminus K_n = B_n$ for all $n$. Thus, $x \\in \\bigcap_{n=1}^\\infty B_n$.\n    Consider the set $W = \\alpha X \\setminus \\{x\\}$. Since $\\alpha X$ is Hausdorff, $\\{x\\}$ is closed, so $W$ is an open neighborhood of $\\infty$.\n    By the definition of a local base, there must exist some $m$ such that $B_m \\subseteq W$.\n    However, $x \\in B_m$ (from above) but $x \\notin W$ (by definition of $W$). This is a contradiction ($x \\in B_m \\implies x \\in W$).\n    \n    Thus, $X = \\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty K_n$. Since each $K_n$ is compact, $X$ is $\\sigma$-compact.\n\n#### Direction $(\\Leftarrow)$: Assume $X$ is metrizable and $\\sigma$-compact.\n\nWe know from Part 1 that $\\alpha X$ is a compact Hausdorff space. To prove it is metrizable, it suffices to show that $\\alpha X$ is second-countable.\n\n1.  **$X$ is second-countable:**\n    Since $X$ is $\\sigma$-compact, we can write $X = \\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty K_n$ where each $K_n$ is compact.\n    Since $X$ is metrizable, each subspace $K_n$ is a compact metric space. A compact metric space is separable (has a countable dense subset).\n    The countable union of separable spaces is separable. Thus, $X$ is a separable metric space.\n    For metric spaces, separability implies second-countability. Let $\\mathcal{B}_X$ be a countable basis for the topology of $X$.\n\n2.  **Constructing a countable basis for $\\alpha X$:**\n    Since $X$ is a locally compact, $\\sigma$-compact Hausdorff space, it admits an **exhaustion by compact sets**. That is, there exists a sequence of compact sets $\\{C_n\\}_{n=1}^\\infty$ such that $C_n \\subseteq \\text{int}(C_{n+1})$ and $X = \\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty C_n$.\n    *(Construction sketch: Let $X = \\bigcup K_n$. Let $C_1 = K_1$. Inductively, since $C_n$ is compact and $X$ locally compact, there is an open set $V$ with $\\overline{V}$ compact such that $C_n \\subseteq V$. Let $C_{n+1} = K_{n+1} \\cup \\overline{V}$.)*\n\n    Define the collection $\\mathcal{V} = \\{ V_n \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\}$ where $V_n = \\alpha X \\setminus C_n$. Each $V_n$ is an open neighborhood of $\\infty$.\n    \n    Consider the collection $\\mathcal{B} = \\mathcal{B}_X \\cup \\mathcal{V}$. Since $\\mathcal{B}_X$ and $\\mathcal{V}$ are countable, $\\mathcal{B}$ is countable. We claim $\\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for $\\alpha X$.\n    \n    Let $W$ be any open set in $\\alpha X$.\n    *   **Case 1: $\\infty \\notin W$.**\n        Then $W \\subseteq X$ is open in $X$. Since $\\mathcal{B}_X$ is a basis for $X$, $W$ can be written as a union of sets from $\\mathcal{B}_X$.\n    *   **Case 2: $\\infty \\in W$.**\n        Then $W = \\alpha X \\setminus K$ for some compact set $K \\subseteq X$.\n        Since $X = \\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty \\text{int}(C_n)$, the collection $\\{\\text{int}(C_n)\\}_{n=1}^\\infty$ is an open cover of $K$. Since $K$ is compact and the sequence is nested, there exists some $N$ such that $K \\subseteq \\text{int}(C_N) \\subseteq C_N$.\n        This implies $\\alpha X \\setminus C_N \\subseteq \\alpha X \\setminus K$, i.e., $V_N \\subseteq W$.\n        Since $\\infty \\in V_N \\subseteq W$, we can express $W$ as the union of $V_N$ and the open set $W \\setminus \\{\\infty\\}$ (which is open in $X$ and thus covered by $\\mathcal{B}_X$).\n        Specifically, for any $p \\in W$:\n        - If $p = \\infty$, $p \\in V_N \\subseteq W$.\n        - If $p \\in X$, there exists $B \\in \\mathcal{B}_X$ such that $p \\in B \\subseteq (W \\cap X) \\subseteq W$.\n        \n    Thus, $\\mathcal{B}$ is a countable basis for $\\alpha X$.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    $\\alpha X$ is a compact Hausdorff space with a countable basis.

Thus, $\\alpha_1|_C = \\xi$ and $\\beta_1|_C = \\xi$.\n*   $C$ is constant in the $y$-direction. Thus, $\\alpha_2|_C = 0$ and $\\beta_2|_C = 0$.\n\n**Additive Structure:**\n\n**Degree 0:**\nSince $X$ is connected, $H^0(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n**Degree 1:**\nThe Mayer-Vietoris sequence segment is:\n$$ 0 \\to H^1(X) \\xrightarrow{\\Phi} H^1(A) \\oplus H^1(B) \\xrightarrow{\\Psi} H^1(C) \\to \\dots $$\n$\\Psi(\\omega_A, \\omega_B) = \\omega_A|_C - \\omega_B|_C$.\nLet a general element in $H^1(A) \\oplus H^1(B)$ be $(c_1 \\alpha_1 + c_2 \\alpha_2, \\, d_1 \\beta_1 + d_2 \\beta_2)$.\n$$ \\Psi(\\dots) = (c_1 \\xi + 0) - (d_1 \\xi + 0) = (c_1 - d_1)\\xi. $$\nThe kernel of $\\Psi$ (which is isomorphic to $H^1(X)$) consists of elements where $c_1 = d_1$. This is a free abelian group of rank 3.\nWe define three generators for $H^1(X)$ by specifying their restrictions to $A$ and $B$:\n1.  $u$: restricts to $\\alpha_1$ on $A$ and $\\beta_1$ on $B$.\n2.  $v_1$: restricts to $\\alpha_2$ on $A$ and $0$ on $B$.\n3.  $v_2$: restricts to $0$ on $A$ and $\\beta_2$ on $B$.\nThus, $H^1(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^3$.\n\n**Degree 2:**\nThe sequence continues:\n$$ \\dots \\xrightarrow{\\Psi} H^1(C) \\xrightarrow{\\delta} H^2(X) \\xrightarrow{\\Phi} H^2(A) \\oplus H^2(B) \\to H^2(C) = 0 $$\nThe map $\\Psi$ is surjective (we can choose $c_1=1, d_1=0$ to get $\\xi$). Therefore, $\\text{Im}(\\Psi) = H^1(C)$, so $\\ker(\\delta) = H^1(C)$, which implies $\\delta$ is the zero map.\nWe get the short exact sequence:\n$$ 0 \\to H^2(X) \\xrightarrow{\\Phi} H^2(A) \\oplus H^2(B) \\to 0 $$\nThus, $H^2(X) \\cong H^2(A) \\oplus H^2(B) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe generators are the unique classes that restrict to the orientation classes (volume forms) of the tori:\n1.  $w_A$: restricts to $\\alpha_1 \\alpha_2$ on $A$ and $0$ on $B$.\n2.  $w_B$: restricts to $0$ on $A$ and $\\beta_1 \\beta_2$ on $B$.\n\n**Degree > 2:**\nSince $A$ and $B$ are 2-dimensional, higher cohomology groups are zero.\n\n**Multiplicative Structure (Ring Structure):**\nWe compute cup products in $H^*(X)$ by restricting to $A$ and $B$. For any $x, y \\in H^*(X)$, $(x \\smile y)|_A = x|_A \\smile y|_A$.\n\nLet the generators of degree 1 be $u, v_1, v_2$ as defined above.\nProducts of degree 1 elements:\n1.  $u^2$: Restricts to $\\alpha_1^2=0$ on $A$ and $\\beta_1^2=0$ on $B$. Result: **0**.\n2.  $v_1^2$: Restricts to $\\alpha_2^2=0$ on $A$ and $0$ on $B$. Result: **0**.\n3.  $v_2^2$: Restricts to $0$ on $A$ and $\\beta_2^2=0$ on $B$. Result: **0**.\n4.  $u v_1$: Restricts to $\\alpha_1 \\alpha_2$ on $A$ and $0$ on $B$. This is exactly $w_A$.\n5.  $u v_2$: Restricts to $0$ on $A$ and $\\beta_1 \\beta_2$ on $B$. This is exactly $w_B$.\n6.  $v_1 v_2$: Restricts to $\\alpha_2 \\smile 0 = 0$ on $A$ and $0 \\smile \\beta_2 = 0$ on $B$. Result: **0**.\n\nSince $u v_1$ and $u v_2$ generate $H^2(X)$, the entire ring is generated by $u, v_1, v_2$.\nThe standard graded-commutative relations hold ($xy = -yx$). The only non-trivial relation derived from the geometry is $v_1 v_2 = 0$.\n\n**Final Answer for 2):**\nThe cohomology ring $H^*(X; \\mathbb{Z})$ is the quotient of the exterior algebra on three generators of degree 1 by the ideal generated by the product of the two \"non-common\" generators.\n\n**Generators:**\n*   $u, v_1, v_2 \\in H^1(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^3$.\n\n**Relations:**\n*   $u^2 = v_1^2 = v_2^2 = 0$ (from exterior algebra structure)\n*   $u v_1 = - v_1 u$\n*   $u v_2 = - v_2 u$\n*   $v_1 v_2 = - v_2 v_1 = 0$\n\nIn concise algebraic notation:\n$$ H^*(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\Lambda_{\\mathbb{Z}}[u, v_1, v_2] \\big/ (v_1 v_2) $$",

Integral Homology $H_i(L(p,q); \\mathbb{Z})$\n\nTo compute the homology of $L(p,q)$, we compute the homology of the cellular chain complex of $L(p,q)$.\n\n**Step 1: Construct the chain complex of the quotient.**\nWe are given the chain complex of the universal cover $S^3$ as a complex of free $\\Lambda$-modules, where $\\Lambda = \\mathbb{Z}[\\mathbb{Z}/p]$:\n$$ C_*(\\tilde{L}): \\quad 0 \\to \\Lambda \\xrightarrow{d_3} \\Lambda \\xrightarrow{d_2} \\Lambda \\xrightarrow{d_1} \\Lambda \\to 0 $$\nwith differentials:\n*   $d_1 = t-1$\n*   $d_2 = \\Sigma = 1+t+\\dots+t^{p-1}$\n*   $d_3 = t^q - 1$\n\nThe cellular chain complex of the quotient space $L(p,q)$ is obtained by tensoring with the trivial module $\\mathbb{Z}$ over $\\Lambda$:\n$$ C_*(L(p,q)) = C_*(\\tilde{L}) \\otimes_{\\Lambda} \\mathbb{Z} $$\nSince $C_i(\\tilde{L}) \\cong \\Lambda$, we have $C_i(L(p,q)) \\cong \\Lambda \\otimes_{\\Lambda} \\mathbb{Z} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. The basis elements are $e_i = \\tilde{e}_i \\otimes 1$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the induced boundary maps.**\nThe boundary maps $\\partial_i: C_i(L) \\to C_{i-1}(L)$ are determined by applying the augmentation map $\\varepsilon: \\Lambda \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ (defined by $t \\mapsto 1$) to the operators $d_i$.\n\n*   $\\partial_1 = \\varepsilon(d_1) = \\varepsilon(t-1) = 1-1 = 0$.\n*   $\\partial_2 = \\varepsilon(d_2) = \\varepsilon(\\sum_{k=0}^{p-1} t^k) = \\sum_{k=0}^{p-1} 1 = p$.\n*   $\\partial_3 = \\varepsilon(d_3) = \\varepsilon(t^q-1) = 1^q - 1 = 0$.\n\nThus, the chain complex $C_*(L(p,q))$ is:\n$$ 0 \\xrightarrow{} \\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{0} \\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{p} \\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{0} \\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{} 0 $$\n(degrees 3, 2, 1, 0 respectively).\n\n**Step 3: Compute Homology Groups.**\nWe calculate $H_i = \\ker(\\partial_i) / \\text{im}(\\partial_{i+1})$.\n\n*   **$i=0$**:\n    $H_0(L) = \\ker(\\epsilon) / \\text{im}(\\partial_1) = \\mathbb{Z} / 0 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n*   **$i=1$**:\n    $\\ker(\\partial_1) = \\mathbb{Z}$ (since $\\partial_1=0$).\n    $\\text{im}(\\partial_2) = p\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    $H_1(L) = \\mathbb{Z} / p\\mathbb{Z} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/p$.\n\n*   **$i=2$**:\n    $\\ker(\\partial_2) = 0$ (since multiplication by $p$ is injective on $\\mathbb{Z}$).\n    $\\text{im}(\\partial_3) = 0$.\n    $H_2(L) = 0 / 0 = 0$.\n\n*   **$i=3$**:\n    $\\ker(\\partial_3) = \\mathbb{Z}$ (since $\\partial_3=0$).\n    $\\text{im}(\\partial_4) = 0$.\n    $H_3(L) = \\mathbb{Z} / 0 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n**Summary of Integral Homology:**\n$$\nH_i(L(p,q); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\begin{cases} \n\\mathbb{Z} & i=0, 3 \\\\\n\\mathbb{Z}/p & i=1 \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### 3.

Since $H^0$ is generated by the unit, we examine products of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.\n\nThe structure depends on $p$.\n\n**Case A: $p$ is odd.**\nFor odd primes, the cup product is graded-commutative. For an element $\\alpha$ of odd degree, $\\alpha \\smile \\alpha = - (\\alpha \\smile \\alpha)$, which implies $2\\alpha^2 = 0$. Since $p$ is odd, 2 is invertible, so $\\alpha^2 = 0$.\nThus:\n1.  $\\alpha \\smile \\alpha = 0$.\n2.  We need to determine $\\alpha \\smile \\beta$.\n    By Poincar\u00e9 Duality for the closed orientable 3-manifold $L(p,q)$ (orientable since $p \\ge 2$), the pairing $H^1 \\times H^2 \\to H^3$ is perfect. Therefore, $\\alpha \\smile \\beta$ is a generator of $H^3 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/p$. We can identify $\\alpha \\beta = \\mu$.\n3.  Also, the Bockstein homomorphism $\\beta_p: H^1(L;\\mathbb{Z}/p) \\to H^2(L;\\mathbb{Z}/p)$ associated with $0 \\to \\mathbb{Z}/p \\to \\mathbb{Z}/p^2 \\to \\mathbb{Z}/p \\to 0$ is an isomorphism because $H^2(L;\\mathbb{Z})=0$ implies $H^2(L;\\mathbb{Z}/p)$ comes entirely from the reduction of the torsion in $H_1$. We can identify $\\beta$ with $\\beta_p(\\alpha)$.\n\n**Result for $p$ odd**: The ring is the tensor product of an exterior algebra on a generator of degree 1 and a truncated polynomial algebra on a generator of degree 2.\n$$ H^*(L(p,q); \\mathbb{Z}/p) \\cong \\Lambda_{\\mathbb{Z}/p}(\\alpha) \\otimes \\mathbb{Z}/p[\\beta] / (\\beta^2) $$\nwhere $\\deg(\\alpha)=1, \\deg(\\beta)=2$. Explicitly: generators $\\alpha, \\beta$ with relations $\\alpha^2=0, \\beta^2=0, \\alpha\\beta \\neq 0$.\n\n**Case B: $p = 2$.**\nFor $p=2$, graded commutativity does not force $\\alpha^2=0$.\nThe space $L(2,q)$ requires $\\gcd(2,q)=1$, so $q$ is odd. $L(2,q) \\cong L(2,1) \\cong \\mathbb{R}P^3$.\nWe know $H^*(\\mathbb{R}P^3; \\mathbb{Z}/2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2[\\alpha] / (\\alpha^4)$.\nJustification for the general lens space structure using the provided complex:\nThe operation $x \\mapsto x \\smile x$ for $x \\in H^1$ corresponds to the Steenrod square $Sq^1(x)$ (or the mod 2 Bockstein). As with the odd case, the Bockstein $\\beta_2: H^1 \\to H^2$ is an isomorphism. Thus $\\alpha^2 = \\alpha \\smile \\alpha \\neq 0$ represents the generator of $H^2$.\nBy Poincar\u00e9 Duality, $\\alpha \\smile \\alpha^2 = \\alpha^3 \\neq 0$ generates $H^3$.\nThen $\\alpha^4$ is in $H^4 = 0$.\n\n**Result for $p=2$**:\n$$ H^*(L(2,q); \\mathbb{Z}/2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2[\\alpha] / (\\alpha^4) $$\nwhere $\\deg(\\alpha)=1$.\n\n---\n\n### 4.

The basis elements are $e_i = \\tilde{e}_i \\otimes 1$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the induced boundary maps.**\nThe boundary maps $\\partial_i: C_i(L) \\to C_{i-1}(L)$ are determined by applying the augmentation map $\\varepsilon: \\Lambda \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ (defined by $t \\mapsto 1$) to the operators $d_i$.\n\n*   $\\partial_1 = \\varepsilon(d_1) = \\varepsilon(t-1) = 1-1 = 0$.\n*   $\\partial_2 = \\varepsilon(d_2) = \\varepsilon(\\sum_{k=0}^{p-1} t^k) = \\sum_{k=0}^{p-1} 1 = p$.\n*   $\\partial_3 = \\varepsilon(d_3) = \\varepsilon(t^q-1) = 1^q - 1 = 0$.\n\nThus, the chain complex $C_*(L(p,q))$ is:\n$$ 0 \\xrightarrow{} \\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{0} \\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{p} \\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{0} \\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{} 0 $$\n(degrees 3, 2, 1, 0 respectively).\n\n**Step 3: Compute Homology Groups.**\nWe calculate $H_i = \\ker(\\partial_i) / \\text{im}(\\partial_{i+1})$.\n\n*   **$i=0$**:\n    $H_0(L) = \\ker(\\epsilon) / \\text{im}(\\partial_1) = \\mathbb{Z} / 0 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n*   **$i=1$**:\n    $\\ker(\\partial_1) = \\mathbb{Z}$ (since $\\partial_1=0$).\n    $\\text{im}(\\partial_2) = p\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    $H_1(L) = \\mathbb{Z} / p\\mathbb{Z} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/p$.\n\n*   **$i=2$**:\n    $\\ker(\\partial_2) = 0$ (since multiplication by $p$ is injective on $\\mathbb{Z}$).\n    $\\text{im}(\\partial_3) = 0$.\n    $H_2(L) = 0 / 0 = 0$.\n\n*   **$i=3$**:\n    $\\ker(\\partial_3) = \\mathbb{Z}$ (since $\\partial_3=0$).\n    $\\text{im}(\\partial_4) = 0$.\n    $H_3(L) = \\mathbb{Z} / 0 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n**Summary of Integral Homology:**\n$$\nH_i(L(p,q); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\begin{cases} \n\\mathbb{Z} & i=0, 3 \\\\\n\\mathbb{Z}/p & i=1 \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### 3. Cohomology Ring $H^*(L(p,q); \\mathbb{Z}/p)$\n\nWe construct the cochain complex with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Z}/p$.\n\n**Step 1: Compute Cohomology Groups.**\nApplying $\\text{Hom}(-,\\mathbb{Z}/p)$ to the complex $C_*(L(p,q))$ (which consists of free $\\mathbb{Z}$-modules):\n$$ C^*(L; \\mathbb{Z}/p) \\cong \\text{Hom}(C_*(L), \\mathbb{Z}/p) $$\nThe coboundary maps $\\delta^i$ are the duals of $\\partial_{i+1}$ modulo $p$.\nSince $\\partial_1=0$, $\\partial_2=p$, and $\\partial_3=0$, and $p \\equiv 0 \\pmod p$, all coboundary maps in the mod-$p$ complex are zero:\n$$ \\mathbb{Z}/p \\xleftarrow{0} \\mathbb{Z}/p \\xleftarrow{0} \\mathbb{Z}/p \\xleftarrow{0} \\mathbb{Z}/p $$\nThus, as additive groups:\n$$ H^i(L(p,q); \\mathbb{Z}/p) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/p \\quad \\text{for } i=0,1,2,3 $$\n\n**Step 2: Determine Ring Structure.**\nLet $1 \\in H^0$, $\\alpha \\in H^1$, $\\beta \\in H^2$, and $\\mu \\in H^3$ be generators of the respective cohomology groups. Since $H^0$ is generated by the unit, we examine products of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.\n\nThe structure depends on $p$.\n\n**Case A: $p$ is odd.**\nFor odd primes, the cup product is graded-commutative. For an element $\\alpha$ of odd degree, $\\alpha \\smile \\alpha = - (\\alpha \\smile \\alpha)$, which implies $2\\alpha^2 = 0$. Since $p$ is odd, 2 is invertible, so $\\alpha^2 = 0$.\nThus:\n1.  $\\alpha \\smile \\alpha = 0$.\n2.  We need to determine $\\alpha \\smile \\beta$.\n    By Poincar\u00e9 Duality for the closed orientable 3-manifold $L(p,q)$ (orientable since $p \\ge 2$), the pairing $H^1 \\times H^2 \\to H^3$ is perfect. Therefore, $\\alpha \\smile \\beta$ is a generator of $H^3 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/p$. We can identify $\\alpha \\beta = \\mu$.\n3.  Also, the Bockstein homomorphism $\\beta_p: H^1(L;\\mathbb{Z}/p) \\to H^2(L;\\mathbb{Z}/p)$ associated with $0 \\to \\mathbb{Z}/p \\to \\mathbb{Z}/p^2 \\to \\mathbb{Z}/p \\to 0$ is an isomorphism because $H^2(L;\\mathbb{Z})=0$ implies $H^2(L;\\mathbb{Z}/p)$ comes entirely from the reduction of the torsion in $H_1$. We can identify $\\beta$ with $\\beta_p(\\alpha)$.\n\n**Result for $p$ odd**: The ring is the tensor product of an exterior algebra on a generator of degree 1 and a truncated polynomial algebra on a generator of degree 2.\n$$ H^*(L(p,q); \\mathbb{Z}/p) \\cong \\Lambda_{\\mathbb{Z}/p}(\\alpha) \\otimes \\mathbb{Z}/p[\\beta] / (\\beta^2) $$\nwhere $\\deg(\\alpha)=1, \\deg(\\beta)=2$. Explicitly: generators $\\alpha, \\beta$ with relations $\\alpha^2=0, \\beta^2=0, \\alpha\\beta \\neq 0$.\n\n**Case B: $p = 2$.**\nFor $p=2$, graded commutativity does not force $\\alpha^2=0$.\nThe space $L(2,q)$ requires $\\gcd(2,q)=1$, so $q$ is odd. $L(2,q) \\cong L(2,1) \\cong \\mathbb{R}P^3$.\nWe know $H^*(\\mathbb{R}P^3; \\mathbb{Z}/2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2[\\alpha] / (\\alpha^4)$.\nJustification for the general lens space structure using the provided complex:\nThe operation $x \\mapsto x \\smile x$ for $x \\in H^1$ corresponds to the Steenrod square $Sq^1(x)$ (or the mod 2 Bockstein). As with the odd case, the Bockstein $\\beta_2: H^1 \\to H^2$ is an isomorphism. Thus $\\alpha^2 = \\alpha \\smile \\alpha \\neq 0$ represents the generator of $H^2$.\nBy Poincar\u00e9 Duality, $\\alpha \\smile \\alpha^2 = \\alpha^3 \\neq 0$ generates $H^3$.\nThen $\\alpha^4$ is in $H^4 = 0$.\n\n**Result for $p=2$**:\n$$ H^*(L(2,q); \\mathbb{Z}/2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2[\\alpha] / (\\alpha^4) $$\nwhere $\\deg(\\alpha)=1$.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Integral Homology Sphere Condition\n\nAn integral homology 3-sphere is a space $X$ such that $H_*(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_*(S^3; \\mathbb{Z})$.\nSpecifically, we require:\n$$ H_0 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}, \\quad H_1 = 0, \\quad H_2 = 0, \\quad H_3 \\cong \\mathbb{Z} $$\nFrom Part 2, we computed:\n$$ H_1(L(p,q); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/p $$\nFor $L(p,q)$ to be an integral homology sphere, we require $H_1 = 0$, which implies $\\mathbb{Z}/p = 0$. This is only possible if $p=1$.\n\nHowever, the problem statement explicitly assumes **$p \\ge 2$**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThere are **no** values of $p, q$ (satisfying the given constraints $p \\ge 2, \\gcd(p,q)=1$) for which $L(p,q)$ is an integral homology 3-sphere.",

Let $P$ be the diagonal matrix defined by $P = \\text{diag}(1, \\alpha, \\alpha^2, \\dots, \\alpha^{n-1})$ with $\\alpha = \\lambda^{-1/2}$.\n\nThe entries of $L$ are $1$ on the subdiagonal ($L_{i, i-1} = 1$), and the entries of $U$ are $1$ on the superdiagonal ($U_{i-1, i} = 1$). The similarity transform $P(U + \\lambda L)P^{-1}$ yields:\n- Subdiagonal entries: $(P \\lambda L P^{-1})_{i, i-1} = \\alpha^{i-1} \\cdot \\lambda \\cdot \\alpha^{-(i-2)} = \\lambda \\alpha = \\lambda^{1/2}$.\n- Superdiagonal entries: $(P U P^{-1})_{i-1, i} = \\alpha^{i-2} \\cdot 1 \\cdot \\alpha^{-(i-1)} = \\alpha^{-1} = \\lambda^{1/2}$.\n\nThus, $P(U + \\lambda L)P^{-1} = \\sqrt{\\lambda}(L+U)$.\nThe determinant equation becomes:\n$$\n\\det\\Bigl(2(\\lambda+\\omega-1)I - \\omega\\sqrt{\\lambda}(L+U)\\Bigr) = 0.\n$$\nLet $J = \\frac{1}{2}(L+U)$.

Here, $\\mu_{\\max} = \\max_k |c_k| = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n+1}\\right)$.\n\nAccording to the standard theory of SOR convergence for consistently ordered matrices (Young's Theorem), the optimal relaxation parameter $\\omega_{\\mathrm{opt}}$ occurs when the discriminant of the quadratic equation vanishes for $\\mu = \\mu_{\\max}$. This implies the two roots for $\\mu_{\\max}$ coincide.\n\nThe condition for $\\omega_{\\mathrm{opt}}$ is:\n$$\n\\omega_{\\mathrm{opt}} = \\frac{2}{1 + \\sqrt{1 - \\mu_{\\max}^2}}.\n$$\nSubstituting $\\mu_{\\max} = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n+1}\\right)$:\n$$\n\\sqrt{1 - \\mu_{\\max}^2} = \\sqrt{1 - \\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n+1}\\right)} = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n+1}\\right).\n$$\nThus,\n$$\n\\omega_{\\mathrm{opt}} = \\frac{2}{1 + \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n+1}\\right)}.\n$$\nAt this optimal $\\omega$, the spectral radius is given by $\\rho_{\\min} = \\omega_{\\mathrm{opt}} - 1$:\n$$\n\\rho_{\\min} = \\frac{2}{1 + \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n+1}\\right)} - 1 = \\frac{1 - \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n+1}\\right)}{1 + \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n+1}\\right)}.\n$$\n\n**Final Answer for Part 2:**\n$$\n\\omega_{\\mathrm{opt}} = \\frac{2}{1 + \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n+1}\\right)}, \\qquad \\rho_{\\min} = \\frac{1 - \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n+1}\\right)}{1 + \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n+1}\\right)}.\n$$\n\n***\n\n### Part 3: Asymptotic Behavior\n\nWe analyze the behavior of $\\rho_{\\min}$ as $n \\to \\infty$.

        "answer": "Here is the complete solution to the problem concerning the algebra $A$ of $2\\times 2$ upper triangular matrices over a field $k$.\n\n### 1. The Jacobson Radical $J(A)$\n\nThe Jacobson radical $J(A)$ of an Artinian ring $A$ is the largest nilpotent ideal of $A$. Since $A$ is a finite-dimensional algebra over a field $k$, it is Artinian.\n\nLet $x = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 0 & c \\end{pmatrix} \\in A$. The eigenvalues of $x$ are the diagonal entries $a$ and $c$. For $x$ to be in a nilpotent ideal, $x$ must be nilpotent, implying $a = c = 0$.\n\nConsider the subset of strictly upper triangular matrices:\n$$\nN = \\left\\{ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & b \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} : b \\in k \\right\\}\n$$\n1.  **Nilpotency**: For any $n \\in N$, $n^2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & b \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & b \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. Thus $N$ is a nilpotent ideal (specifically $N^2 = 0$).\n2.  **Maximality**: Consider the quotient map $\\phi: A \\to k \\times k$ defined by $\\phi\\left(\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 0 & c \\end{pmatrix}\\right) = (a, c)$. This is a surjective algebra homomorphism. The kernel of $\\phi$ is exactly $N$.\n    The quotient algebra $A/N \\cong k \\times k$ is a product of fields, which is semisimple. Therefore, its Jacobson radical is zero: $J(A/N) = 0$.\n    Since $J(A/N) = J(A)/N$ (because $N \\subseteq J(A)$), we must have $J(A)/N = 0$, which implies $J(A) \\subseteq N$.\n\nSince $N$ is a nilpotent ideal, $N \\subseteq J(A)$. Therefore, $J(A) = N$.\n\n**Answer:**\n$$\nJ(A) = \\left\\{ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & b \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} : b \\in k \\right\\}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### 2. Classification of Two-Sided Ideals\n\nLet $I$ be a two-sided ideal of $A$. We can classify the ideals by considering their relationship with the Jacobson radical $J(A)$.\n\n**Step 1: Ideals not contained in $J(A)$ must contain $J(A)$.**\nLet $I$ be a non-zero ideal. Suppose $I \\not\\subseteq J(A)$.

        "raw_answer": "Here is the complete solution to the problem concerning the algebra $A$ of $2\\times 2$ upper triangular matrices over a field $k$.\n\n### 1. The Jacobson Radical $J(A)$\n\nThe Jacobson radical $J(A)$ of an Artinian ring $A$ is the largest nilpotent ideal of $A$. Since $A$ is a finite-dimensional algebra over a field $k$, it is Artinian.\n\nLet $x = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 0 & c \\end{pmatrix} \\in A$. The eigenvalues of $x$ are the diagonal entries $a$ and $c$. For $x$ to be in a nilpotent ideal, $x$ must be nilpotent, implying $a = c = 0$.\n\nConsider the subset of strictly upper triangular matrices:\n$$\nN = \\left\\{ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & b \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} : b \\in k \\right\\}\n$$\n1.  **Nilpotency**: For any $n \\in N$, $n^2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & b \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & b \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. Thus $N$ is a nilpotent ideal (specifically $N^2 = 0$).\n2.  **Maximality**: Consider the quotient map $\\phi: A \\to k \\times k$ defined by $\\phi\\left(\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 0 & c \\end{pmatrix}\\right) = (a, c)$. This is a surjective algebra homomorphism. The kernel of $\\phi$ is exactly $N$.\n    The quotient algebra $A/N \\cong k \\times k$ is a product of fields, which is semisimple. Therefore, its Jacobson radical is zero: $J(A/N) = 0$.\n    Since $J(A/N) = J(A)/N$ (because $N \\subseteq J(A)$), we must have $J(A)/N = 0$, which implies $J(A) \\subseteq N$.\n\nSince $N$ is a nilpotent ideal, $N \\subseteq J(A)$. Therefore, $J(A) = N$.\n\n**Answer:**\n$$\nJ(A) = \\left\\{ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & b \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} : b \\in k \\right\\}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### 2. Classification of Two-Sided Ideals\n\nLet $I$ be a two-sided ideal of $A$. We can classify the ideals by considering their relationship with the Jacobson radical $J(A)$.\n\n**Step 1: Ideals not contained in $J(A)$ must contain $J(A)$.**\nLet $I$ be a non-zero ideal. Suppose $I \\not\\subseteq J(A)$. Then there exists $x = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 0 & c \\end{pmatrix} \\in I$ such that at least one of $a, c$ is non-zero.\n-   If $a \\neq 0$, then $x \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & a \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\in I$. Multiplying by $a^{-1}$ gives $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\in I$, so $J(A) \\subseteq I$.\n-   If $c \\neq 0$, then $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot x = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & c \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\in I$. Multiplying by $c^{-1}$ gives $J(A) \\subseteq I$.\n\nThus, any ideal $I \\neq \\{0\\}$ either is equal to $J(A)$ or contains $J(A)$.\n\n**Step 2: Ideals containing $J(A)$.**\nBy the Correspondence Theorem, ideals of $A$ containing $J(A)$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the ideals of the quotient ring $A/J(A) \\cong k \\times k$.\nThe ideals of $k \\times k$ are:\n1.  $\\{(0,0)\\}$\n2.  $k \\times \\{0\\}$\n3.  $\\{0\\} \\times k$\n4.  $k \\times k$\n\nWe lift these back to $A$ via the homomorphism $\\phi(x) = (a,c)$:\n1.  $\\phi^{-1}(\\{(0,0)\\}) = \\text{Ker}(\\phi) = J(A)$.\n2.  $\\phi^{-1}(k \\times \\{0\\}) = \\{ x \\in A : c = 0 \\} = \\left\\{ \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} : a, b \\in k \\right\\}$.\n3.  $\\phi^{-1}(\\{0\\} \\times k) = \\{ x \\in A : a = 0 \\} = \\left\\{ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & b \\\\ 0 & c \\end{pmatrix} : b, c \\in k \\right\\}$.\n4.  $\\phi^{-1}(k \\times k) = A$.\n\nAdding the zero ideal $\\{0\\}$ (which is contained in $J(A)$), we have exactly 5 two-sided ideals.\n\n**Answer:**\nThere are exactly 5 two-sided ideals in $A$:\n1.  $I_0 = \\{0\\} = \\left\\{ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right\\}$\n2.  $I_1 = J(A) = \\left\\{ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & b \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} : b \\in k \\right\\}$\n3.  $I_2 = \\left\\{ \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} : a, b \\in k \\right\\}$ (Matrices with zero second row)\n4.  $I_3 = \\left\\{ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & b \\\\ 0 & c \\end{pmatrix} : b, c \\in k \\right\\}$ (Matrices with zero first column)\n5.  $I_4 = A = \\left\\{ \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 0 & c \\end{pmatrix} : a, b, c \\in k \\right\\}$\n\n---\n\n### 3.
