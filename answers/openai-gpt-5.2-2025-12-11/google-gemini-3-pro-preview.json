The theory $T$ is a set of first-order sentences in $L$.\n    The Downward L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem Theorem states that if a first-order theory in a countable language has an infinite model, then it has a model of cardinality $\\aleph_0$ (a countable model).\n\nSince we proved in Part 1 that $T$ has a model (which must be infinite), it follows that $T$ has a countable model.\n\n***\n\n### Part 3: $\\aleph_0$-Categoricity of $T$\n\nWe prove that any two countable models of $T$ are isomorphic.

        "answer": "To find the number of distinct admissible colorings up to dihedral symmetry, we will use **Burnside's Lemma** (also known as the Cauchy-Frobenius Lemma). The number of distinct colorings (orbits) is the average number of colorings fixed by each symmetry in the group $D_{10}$.\n\n### 1. Setup and Total Admissible Colorings\n\nLet $X$ be the set of all admissible colorings of the necklace. The necklace has $n=10$ beads, with $k=4$ black beads (B) and $10-4=6$ white beads (W). The condition is that no two black beads are adjacent.\n\nThe number of such linear arrangements of $n$ beads is not immediately applicable due to the circular symmetry. The number of ways to choose $k$ non-adjacent items from $n$ arranged in a circle is given by the formula:\n$$ |X| = \\frac{n}{n-k} \\binom{n-k}{k} $$\nSubstituting $n=10$ and $k=4$:\n$$ |X| = \\frac{10}{10-4} \\binom{10-4}{4} = \\frac{10}{6} \\binom{6}{4} = \\frac{5}{3} \\times 15 = 25 $$\nSo, there are **25** admissible colorings in fixed positions.\n\nThe group acting on the necklace is the dihedral group $D_{10}$, which has order $|D_{10}| = 20$. The elements are:\n- 1 Identity ($e$)\n- 9 Rotations ($r, r^2, \\dots, r^9$)\n- 10 Reflections (5 axes through vertices, 5 axes through edge midpoints)\n\nWe calculate the number of colorings fixed by each type of symmetry, $|X^g|$.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Fixed Points\n\n**Identity ($e$):**\nThe identity fixes all elements in $X$.\n$$ |X^e| = 25 $$\n\n**Rotations ($r^k$):**\nA rotation $r^k$ partitions the 10 beads into $d = \\gcd(k, 10)$ cycles of length $10/d$. For a coloring to be fixed, all beads in a cycle must be the same color.\n- **$k=5$ (Rotation by $180^\\circ$):**\n  Here $\\gcd(5,10)=5$. There are 5 cycles of length 2. Each cycle consists of diametrically opposite beads $\\{i, i+5\\}$.\n  We must choose pairs of cycles to be black to get a total of 4 black beads. Since each cycle has size 2, we must choose exactly 2 cycles to be black.\n  The condition \"no two black beads adjacent\" implies we cannot choose adjacent cycles (since choosing cycle $\\{i, i+5\\}$ makes beads $i$ and $i+5$ black; if we also chose $\\{i+1, i+6\\}$, beads $i$ and $i+1$ would be adjacent blacks).\n  We need to choose 2 non-adjacent cycles from the 5 cycles arranged in a circle. Using the same circular combination formula for $n'=5, k'=2$:\n  $$ \\frac{5}{5-2} \\binom{5-2}{2} = \\frac{5}{3} \\binom{3}{2} = 5 $$\n  So, $|X^{r^5}| = 5$.\n\n- **Other Rotations ($k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9\\}$):**\n  - If $\\gcd(k,10)=1$ (Generators): 1 cycle of length 10. We must color all 10 beads the same. Impossible since we have 4 B and 6 W.\n  - If $\\gcd(k,10)=2$ (Rotations by multiples of $72^\\circ$): 2 cycles of length 5. We must choose whole cycles. Choosing 0 yields 0 B; choosing 1 yields 5 B. We need exactly 4 B. Impossible.\n  Thus, for all these rotations, $|X^{r^k}| = 0$.\n\n**Reflections:**\nThere are two types of reflection axes for a regular decagon.\n\n- **Type 1: Axis through opposite vertices (5 reflections):**\n  The axis passes through 2 beads (fixing them) and swaps the other 8 beads in 4 pairs.\n  Let the fixed beads be $u, v$ and pairs be $p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4$.\n  Let $x_u, x_v \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ be colors of fixed beads, and $y_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ be colors of pairs ($1=$ black).\n  Total black beads: $x_u + x_v + 2\\sum y_i = 4$.\n  This requires $x_u + x_v$ to be even.\n  \n  *Case A: $x_u=1, x_v=1$.*\n  Then $2 + 2\\sum y_i = 4 \\implies \\sum y_i = 1$. We choose 1 pair to be black.\n  Adjacency constraints: Fixed beads are black, so their neighbors cannot be black. The \"chain\" of pairs sits between the fixed beads. The pairs adjacent to $u$ or $v$ must be white. The two middle pairs are not adjacent to $u$ or $v$.\n  Checking the graph: There are 2 such valid pairs (those not containing neighbors of $u$ or $v$).\n  Number of ways = 2.\n  \n  *Case B: $x_u=0, x_v=0$.*\n  Then $0 + 2\\sum y_i = 4 \\implies \\sum y_i = 2$. We choose 2 pairs to be black.\n  Constraints: No two chosen pairs can be adjacent (corresponding beads would be adjacent).\n  We are selecting 2 non-adjacent pairs from a line of 4 pairs.\n  Number of ways = $\\binom{4-2+1}{2} = \\binom{3}{2} = 3$.\n  \n  Total fixed points per reflection = $2 + 3 = 5$.\n  Total for 5 reflections = $5 \\times 5 = 25$.\n\n- **Type 2: Axis through midpoints of opposite edges (5 reflections):**\n  The axis passes between beads. All 10 beads are swapped in 5 pairs.\n  We must choose 2 pairs to be black ($2 \\times 2 = 4$ beads).\n  Adjacency constraints:\n  1. The beads within a pair must not be adjacent. Two of the 5 pairs consist of adjacent beads (the edges the axis cuts). These pairs cannot be black.\n  2. The remaining 3 pairs form a line in the quotient graph.

        "raw_answer": "To find the number of distinct admissible colorings up to dihedral symmetry, we will use **Burnside's Lemma** (also known as the Cauchy-Frobenius Lemma). The number of distinct colorings (orbits) is the average number of colorings fixed by each symmetry in the group $D_{10}$.\n\n### 1. Setup and Total Admissible Colorings\n\nLet $X$ be the set of all admissible colorings of the necklace. The necklace has $n=10$ beads, with $k=4$ black beads (B) and $10-4=6$ white beads (W). The condition is that no two black beads are adjacent.\n\nThe number of such linear arrangements of $n$ beads is not immediately applicable due to the circular symmetry. The number of ways to choose $k$ non-adjacent items from $n$ arranged in a circle is given by the formula:\n$$ |X| = \\frac{n}{n-k} \\binom{n-k}{k} $$\nSubstituting $n=10$ and $k=4$:\n$$ |X| = \\frac{10}{10-4} \\binom{10-4}{4} = \\frac{10}{6} \\binom{6}{4} = \\frac{5}{3} \\times 15 = 25 $$\nSo, there are **25** admissible colorings in fixed positions.\n\nThe group acting on the necklace is the dihedral group $D_{10}$, which has order $|D_{10}| = 20$. The elements are:\n- 1 Identity ($e$)\n- 9 Rotations ($r, r^2, \\dots, r^9$)\n- 10 Reflections (5 axes through vertices, 5 axes through edge midpoints)\n\nWe calculate the number of colorings fixed by each type of symmetry, $|X^g|$.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Fixed Points\n\n**Identity ($e$):**\nThe identity fixes all elements in $X$.\n$$ |X^e| = 25 $$\n\n**Rotations ($r^k$):**\nA rotation $r^k$ partitions the 10 beads into $d = \\gcd(k, 10)$ cycles of length $10/d$. For a coloring to be fixed, all beads in a cycle must be the same color.\n- **$k=5$ (Rotation by $180^\\circ$):**\n  Here $\\gcd(5,10)=5$. There are 5 cycles of length 2. Each cycle consists of diametrically opposite beads $\\{i, i+5\\}$.\n  We must choose pairs of cycles to be black to get a total of 4 black beads. Since each cycle has size 2, we must choose exactly 2 cycles to be black.\n  The condition \"no two black beads adjacent\" implies we cannot choose adjacent cycles (since choosing cycle $\\{i, i+5\\}$ makes beads $i$ and $i+5$ black; if we also chose $\\{i+1, i+6\\}$, beads $i$ and $i+1$ would be adjacent blacks).\n  We need to choose 2 non-adjacent cycles from the 5 cycles arranged in a circle. Using the same circular combination formula for $n'=5, k'=2$:\n  $$ \\frac{5}{5-2} \\binom{5-2}{2} = \\frac{5}{3} \\binom{3}{2} = 5 $$\n  So, $|X^{r^5}| = 5$.\n\n- **Other Rotations ($k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9\\}$):**\n  - If $\\gcd(k,10)=1$ (Generators): 1 cycle of length 10. We must color all 10 beads the same. Impossible since we have 4 B and 6 W.\n  - If $\\gcd(k,10)=2$ (Rotations by multiples of $72^\\circ$): 2 cycles of length 5. We must choose whole cycles. Choosing 0 yields 0 B; choosing 1 yields 5 B. We need exactly 4 B. Impossible.\n  Thus, for all these rotations, $|X^{r^k}| = 0$.\n\n**Reflections:**\nThere are two types of reflection axes for a regular decagon.\n\n- **Type 1: Axis through opposite vertices (5 reflections):**\n  The axis passes through 2 beads (fixing them) and swaps the other 8 beads in 4 pairs.\n  Let the fixed beads be $u, v$ and pairs be $p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4$.\n  Let $x_u, x_v \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ be colors of fixed beads, and $y_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ be colors of pairs ($1=$ black).\n  Total black beads: $x_u + x_v + 2\\sum y_i = 4$.\n  This requires $x_u + x_v$ to be even.\n  \n  *Case A: $x_u=1, x_v=1$.*\n  Then $2 + 2\\sum y_i = 4 \\implies \\sum y_i = 1$. We choose 1 pair to be black.\n  Adjacency constraints: Fixed beads are black, so their neighbors cannot be black. The \"chain\" of pairs sits between the fixed beads. The pairs adjacent to $u$ or $v$ must be white. The two middle pairs are not adjacent to $u$ or $v$.\n  Checking the graph: There are 2 such valid pairs (those not containing neighbors of $u$ or $v$).\n  Number of ways = 2.\n  \n  *Case B: $x_u=0, x_v=0$.*\n  Then $0 + 2\\sum y_i = 4 \\implies \\sum y_i = 2$. We choose 2 pairs to be black.\n  Constraints: No two chosen pairs can be adjacent (corresponding beads would be adjacent).\n  We are selecting 2 non-adjacent pairs from a line of 4 pairs.\n  Number of ways = $\\binom{4-2+1}{2} = \\binom{3}{2} = 3$.\n  \n  Total fixed points per reflection = $2 + 3 = 5$.\n  Total for 5 reflections = $5 \\times 5 = 25$.\n\n- **Type 2: Axis through midpoints of opposite edges (5 reflections):**\n  The axis passes between beads. All 10 beads are swapped in 5 pairs.\n  We must choose 2 pairs to be black ($2 \\times 2 = 4$ beads).\n  Adjacency constraints:\n  1. The beads within a pair must not be adjacent. Two of the 5 pairs consist of adjacent beads (the edges the axis cuts). These pairs cannot be black.\n  2. The remaining 3 pairs form a line in the quotient graph. We must choose 2 non-adjacent pairs from these 3.\n  There is only 1 way to choose 2 non-adjacent items from 3 (the two ends).\n  Total fixed points per reflection = 1.\n  Total for 5 reflections = $5 \\times 1 = 5$.\n\n### 3.

Elements and Hasse Diagram of $\\operatorname{DM}(P)$\n\nThe Dedekind\u2013MacNeille completion $\\operatorname{DM}(P)$ consists of all subsets $X \\subseteq P$ such that $X = X^{ul}$. Such sets are often called **cuts** or **closed sets**. Note that for any $X$, $X^{ul}$ is the smallest closed set containing $X$. Furthermore, the principal ideals $\\downarrow p = \\{x \\in P \\mid x \\leq p\\}$ are always closed sets in any poset, so $\\iota(p) = \\downarrow p \\in \\operatorname{DM}(P)$ for all $p \\in P$.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Principal Closed Sets**\nWe compute $\\downarrow p$ for each $p \\in P$:\n1.  $\\iota(0) = \\downarrow 0 = \\{0\\}$\n2.  $\\iota(a) = \\downarrow a = \\{0, a\\}$\n3.  $\\iota(b) = \\downarrow b = \\{0, b\\}$\n4.  $\\iota(c) = \\downarrow c = \\{0, a, b, c\\}$ (Note: $a<c$ and $b<c$)\n5.  $\\iota(d) = \\downarrow d = \\{0, a, b, d\\}$ (Note: $a<d$ and $b<d$)\n6.  $\\iota(1) = \\downarrow 1 = \\{0, a, b, c, d, 1\\} = P$\n\n**Step 2: Identify Non-Principal Closed Sets**\nThe closed sets form a closure system, meaning the intersection of any family of closed sets is closed. We examine intersections of the principal sets found above to see if new sets arise.\nThe intersection of $\\iota(c)$ and $\\iota(d)$ is:\n$$ M = \\iota(c) \\cap \\iota(d) = \\{0, a, b, c\\} \\cap \\{0, a, b, d\\} = \\{0, a, b\\} $$\nLet us verify if $M$ is closed by computing $M^{ul}$.\n1.  **Upper bounds** $M^u = \\{0, a, b\\}^u$. We look for elements $p$ such that $0 \\le p, a \\le p, b \\le p$.\n    The common upper bounds of $a$ and $b$ are $\\{c, d, 1\\}$. Thus, $M^u = \\{c, d, 1\\}$.\n2.  **Lower bounds of $M^u$**: $M^{ul} = \\{c, d, 1\\}^l$.

Since 9 is odd and $\\langle 4, 6 \\rangle$ generates only even numbers, $z$ cannot be expressed in terms of $x$ and $y$.\n    Consider $z^2$, with weight 18.\n    $$ z^2 \\mapsto (t^9)^2 = t^{18} $$\n    We can express 18 using $x$ and $y$:\n    $$ y^3 \\mapsto (t^6)^3 = t^{18} $$\n    Thus, $f_2 = z^2 - y^3$ is in $\\ker(\\varphi)$.\n    (Note: $x^3y$ also has weight $12+6=18$, but $z^2 - x^3y$ is in the ideal generated by $f_1$ and $f_2$ because $z^2 - x^3y = (z^2 - y^3) + y(y^2 - x^3)$).\n\n**Minimality and Completeness:**\nThe numerical semigroup $S = \\langle 4, 6, 9 \\rangle$ allows us to check if the ring $A$ is a complete intersection. We calculate the \"gaps\" of $S$ (positive integers not in $S$):\n-   Using $4$ and $6$, we can form $\\{0, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, \\dots\\}$.\n-   Adding $9$, we fill in odd numbers: $9, 13 (9+4), 15 (9+6), 17 (9+8), \\dots$.\n-   The set of elements in $S$ is $\\{0, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, \\dots\\}$.\n-   The set of gaps is $G = \\{1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11\\}$.\n\nThe Frobenius number (largest gap) is $F = 11$. The number of gaps is $|G| = 6$.\nA numerical semigroup is **symmetric** if for every integer $n$, $n \\in S \\iff F-n \\notin S$.\nLet's verify symmetry for $S$:\n-   $11 - 1 = 10 \\in S$\n-   $11 - 2 = 9 \\in S$\n-   $11 - 3 = 8 \\in S$\n-   $11 - 5 = 6 \\in S$\n-   $11 - 7 = 4 \\in S$\n-   $11 - 11 = 0 \\in S$\nSince $S$ is symmetric, the ring $A$ is a Gorenstein ring. For monomial curves in affine 3-space, $A$ is a complete intersection if and only if $S$ is symmetric.\nBeing a complete intersection of embedding dimension 3 implies that the defining ideal $\\ker(\\varphi)$ is generated by exactly $3-1 = 2$ elements.\n\nWe have found two independent generators $y^2 - x^3$ and $z^2 - y^3$. Therefore, they constitute a minimal generating set.\n\n**Result:**\n$$ \\ker(\\varphi) = \\langle y^2 - x^3, \\ z^2 - y^3 \\rangle $$\n\n---\n\n### 2. Computation of $\\overline{A}$\n\nThe integral closure $\\overline{A}$ is the closure of $A$ in its field of fractions.\n\n1.  **Field of Fractions:**\n    Let $K = \\mathrm{Frac}(A)$. Since $x, y, z \\in A$, we have $t^4, t^6, t^9 \\in K$.\n    Notice that $y/x = t^6/t^4 = t^2$.\n    Then $z / (t^2)^4 = t^9 / t^8 = t$.\n    Since $t \\in K$, we have $k(t) \\subseteq K$. Conversely, $A \\subset k[t] \\subset k(t)$, so $K \\subseteq k(t)$.\n    Thus, $\\mathrm{Frac}(A) = k(t)$.\n\n2.  **Integral Closure:**\n    We seek the integral closure of $A$ in $k(t)$.\n    The ring $k[t]$ is a Principal Ideal Domain (PID), so it is integrally closed in its field of fractions $k(t)$.\n    Clearly $A \\subset k[t]$. Furthermore, the element $t$ is integral over $A$ because it satisfies the monic polynomial $X^4 - t^4 = 0$ (where $t^4 \\in A$).\n    Since $k[t]$ is generated by $t$ over $k$, and $t$ is integral over $A$, the entire ring $k[t]$ is integral over $A$.\n    Since $k[t]$ is the integral closure of $k[t]$ and is integral over $A$, it must be the integral closure of $A$.\n\n**Result:**\n$$ \\overline{A} = k[t] $$\n\n---\n\n### 3. Computation of the Conductor $\\mathfrak{f}$\n\nThe conductor of $A$ in $\\overline{A}$ is defined as $\\mathfrak{f} = \\{ a \\in A : a \\overline{A} \\subseteq A \\}$. Since $\\overline{A} = k[t]$, this corresponds to determining which monomials $t^s \\in A$ satisfy $t^s \\cdot t^n \\in A$ for all $n \\geq 0$. This holds if and only if $s + n \\in S$ for all $n \\geq 0$.\n\nThis condition is equivalent to $s \\geq C$, where $C$ is the **conductor of the numerical semigroup** $S$. The conductor of $S$ is related to the Frobenius number $F$ by $C = F + 1$.\n\n1.  **Finding the Conductor of $S$:**\n    From Part 1, we determined the Frobenius number $F = 11$.\n    Therefore, the conductor is $C = 11 + 1 = 12$.\n    This means that for all integers $s \\geq 12$, $t^s \\in A$.\n    The ideal $\\mathfrak{f}$ consists of all polynomials in $A$ with terms of degree $\\geq 12$ in $t$. As a $k$-vector space, $\\mathfrak{f}$ is spanned by $\\{t^{12}, t^{13}, t^{14}, \\dots\\}$.\n\n2.  **Minimal Monomial Generators in $A$:**\n    We need to find a minimal set of generators for $\\mathfrak{f}$ as an ideal of $A$. We look for elements $t^s$ with $s \\geq 12$ that cannot be written as $a \\cdot f$ where $a \\in A$ has positive degree (i.e., $a \\in \\mathfrak{m}_A = \\langle t^4, t^6, t^9 \\rangle$).\n    This means we need $s \\geq 12$ such that $s - e \\notin \\{12, 13, \\dots\\}$ for any $e \\in \\{4, 6, 9, \\dots\\}$. Equivalently, we need $s \\geq 12$ such that $s - 4 < 12$.\n    \n    The condition $s - 4 < 12$ implies $12 \\leq s < 16$.\n    The candidate degrees are $12, 13, 14, 15$.\n    Since $1, 2, 3$ are gaps in $S$ (elements not in $S$), we cannot shift $t^{12}, t^{13}, t^{14}, t^{15}$ downwards by multiplication by elements in $A$ to obtain other generators. Conversely, any $t^k$ with $k \\geq 16$ can be written as $t^4 \\cdot t^{k-4}$ where $k-4 \\geq 12$, so $t^k \\in \\langle t^4 \\rangle \\mathfrak{f}$.\n     Thus, the minimal generators correspond to $t^{12}, t^{13}, t^{14}, t^{15}$.\n\n3.  **Expressing Generators in terms of $x, y, z$:**\n    We find monomials in $k[x,y,z]$ that map to these powers of $t$:\n    -   $s=12$: $x^3 \\mapsto t^{12}$ (also $y^2 \\mapsto t^{12}$).\n    -   $s=13$: We need $4a + 6b + 9c = 13$.\n        -   Parity check: $4a+6b$ is even, 13 is odd, so $c$ must be odd.\n        -   If $c=1$, $4a+6b = 4 \\implies a=1, b=0$. Monomial: $xz$.\n    -   $s=14$: We need $4a + 6b + 9c = 14$.\n        -   $c$ must be even. If $c=0$, $4a+6b=14 \\implies 2a+3b=7$.\n        -   Solution: $b=1 \\implies 2a=4 \\implies a=2$. Monomial: $x^2 y$.\n    -   $s=15$: We need $4a + 6b + 9c = 15$.\n        -   $c$ must be odd. If $c=1$, $4a+6b=6$.\n        -   Solution: $b=1 \\implies 4a=0 \\implies a=0$. Monomial: $yz$.\n\n    The set of generators in $A$ is the images of $\\{x^3, xz, x^2y, yz\\}$. Note that $y^2$ is also a generator for degree 12, but since $y^2 = x^3$ in $A$, including both would not be minimal.\n\n**Result:**\nThe conductor is $\\mathfrak{f} = \\langle t^{12}, t^{13}, t^{14}, t^{15} \\rangle_A$.\nA minimal set of monomial generators for $\\mathfrak{f}$ as an ideal of $A$ is:\n$$ \\{ x^3, xz, x^2 y, yz \\} $$",

        "answer": "To solve the problem, we will proceed in three parts corresponding to the requirements: analyzing the geometric properties of $A$ and $X$, computing the class group $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$, and determining the order of the divisor class $[D]$.\n\n### 1. Normality and Singular Locus\n\n**The Ring $A$ is a Domain**\nLet $A = k[x,y,z]/(xy - z^n)$. The polynomial $f = xy - z^n$ is irreducible in the polynomial ring $k[x,y,z]$. This can be seen by viewing $f$ as a polynomial in $k[x,y][z]$. It is monic of degree $n$ in $z$. By Eisenstein's Criterion with the prime ideal $(x) \\subset k[x,y]$, we note that:\n- The coefficient of $z^n$ is $1 \\notin (x)$.\n- The constant term is $-xy \\in (x)$.\n- The constant term $-xy \\notin (x)^2$ because $y \\notin (x)$.\nThus, $f$ is irreducible, and $A$ is an integral domain.\n\n**Singular Locus of $X$**\nLet $X = \\operatorname{Spec}(A)$. The singular locus of $X$ is defined by the vanishing of the partial derivatives of the defining polynomial $f = xy - z^n$ along with the polynomial itself. The Jacobian ideal $J$ in $k[x,y,z]$ is generated by:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = y, \\quad \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = x, \\quad \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} = -nz^{n-1}.\n$$\nSince $\\operatorname{char}(k) \\nmid n$, the condition $-nz^{n-1} = 0$ implies $z^{n-1} = 0$, and thus $z=0$ (as the nilradical is zero in the reduced ring of the ambient affine space).\nSetting the derivatives to zero, we obtain the system:\n$$ x = 0, \\quad y = 0, \\quad z = 0. $$\nThis corresponds to the origin $P = (0,0,0)$. This point lies on the surface $X$ since $0\\cdot 0 - 0^n = 0$.\nThus, the singular locus of $X$, denoted $\\operatorname{Sing}(X)$, consists of exactly one point: the origin.\n\n**Normality of $A$**\nTo show $A$ is normal, we use Serre's Criterion for normality, which requires that $A$ satisfies properties $R_1$ and $S_2$.\n1.  **$R_1$ (Regular in codimension 1):** Since $\\operatorname{Sing}(X) = \\{P\\}$ has codimension 2 in the 2-dimensional variety $X$ (dim $X = 3 - 1 = 2$), the singular locus does not contain any divisors. Thus, $X$ is regular in codimension 1.\n2.  **$S_2$ (Serre's condition $S_2$):** Since $A$ is a hypersurface in $\\mathbb{A}^3$, it is a complete intersection and therefore Cohen-Macaulay. Cohen-Macaulay rings satisfy condition $S_k$ for all $k \\le \\dim A$. Since $\\dim A = 2$, $A$ satisfies $S_2$.\n\nSince $A$ satisfies $R_1$ and $S_2$, $A$ is a normal domain.\n\n### 2. Computing $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$\n\nWe compute the Weil divisor class group $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$ using the exact sequence relating the class group of $A$ to an open subset. Let $U = X \\setminus V(x) \\subset X$. This corresponds to the localization $A_x = A[1/x]$.\n\n**Analyzing the Localization $A_x$**\nIn the ring $A_x$, $x$ is a unit. From the relation $xy = z^n$, we can write $y = x^{-1}z^n$.\nThus, we have an isomorphism:\n$$ A_x = k[x, y, z, x^{-1}] / (y - x^{-1}z^n) \\cong k[x, x^{-1}, z]. $$\nThe ring $k[x, x^{-1}, z]$ is the localization of the polynomial ring $k[x, z]$ at the multiplicative set generated by $x$. Since $k[x, z]$ is a Unique Factorization Domain (UFD), its localization $A_x$ is also a UFD.\nTherefore, $\\mathrm{Cl}(A_x) = 0$.\n\n**Nagata's Sequence**\nWe have the exact sequence:\n$$ \\bigoplus_{\\mathfrak{p} \\in Z} \\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{\\text{div}} \\mathrm{Cl}(A) \\to \\mathrm{Cl}(A_x) \\to 0, $$\nwhere $Z$ is the set of height-1 prime ideals of $A$ containing $x$.\nThe ideal $(x) \\subset A$ is defined by $x=0$. In $A$, $x=0 \\implies z^n = 0 \\implies z=0$.\nSo $V(x)$ is supported on the set $x=z=0$.\nConsider the ideal $\\mathfrak{p} = (x, z)$.\n- $\\mathfrak{p}$ is prime because $A/\\mathfrak{p} \\cong k[x,y,z]/(x, z, xy-z^n) \\cong k[y]$, which is a domain.\n- $\\mathfrak{p}$ has height 1 in $A$ (as it corresponds to a line in a surface).\n- Any prime ideal containing $x$ must contain $z$ (since $z^n \\in (x)$). Thus $\\mathfrak{p} = (x,z)$ is the unique height-1 prime containing $x$.\n\nThe sequence becomes:\n$$ \\mathbb{Z} \\cdot [D] \\xrightarrow{\\phi} \\mathrm{Cl}(A) \\to 0 $$\nwhere $D$ is the divisor corresponding to $\\mathfrak{p}$.\nThis implies $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$ is generated by the class $[D]$.

        "raw_answer": "To solve the problem, we will proceed in three parts corresponding to the requirements: analyzing the geometric properties of $A$ and $X$, computing the class group $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$, and determining the order of the divisor class $[D]$.\n\n### 1. Normality and Singular Locus\n\n**The Ring $A$ is a Domain**\nLet $A = k[x,y,z]/(xy - z^n)$. The polynomial $f = xy - z^n$ is irreducible in the polynomial ring $k[x,y,z]$. This can be seen by viewing $f$ as a polynomial in $k[x,y][z]$. It is monic of degree $n$ in $z$. By Eisenstein's Criterion with the prime ideal $(x) \\subset k[x,y]$, we note that:\n- The coefficient of $z^n$ is $1 \\notin (x)$.\n- The constant term is $-xy \\in (x)$.\n- The constant term $-xy \\notin (x)^2$ because $y \\notin (x)$.\nThus, $f$ is irreducible, and $A$ is an integral domain.\n\n**Singular Locus of $X$**\nLet $X = \\operatorname{Spec}(A)$. The singular locus of $X$ is defined by the vanishing of the partial derivatives of the defining polynomial $f = xy - z^n$ along with the polynomial itself. The Jacobian ideal $J$ in $k[x,y,z]$ is generated by:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = y, \\quad \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = x, \\quad \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} = -nz^{n-1}.\n$$\nSince $\\operatorname{char}(k) \\nmid n$, the condition $-nz^{n-1} = 0$ implies $z^{n-1} = 0$, and thus $z=0$ (as the nilradical is zero in the reduced ring of the ambient affine space).\nSetting the derivatives to zero, we obtain the system:\n$$ x = 0, \\quad y = 0, \\quad z = 0. $$\nThis corresponds to the origin $P = (0,0,0)$. This point lies on the surface $X$ since $0\\cdot 0 - 0^n = 0$.\nThus, the singular locus of $X$, denoted $\\operatorname{Sing}(X)$, consists of exactly one point: the origin.\n\n**Normality of $A$**\nTo show $A$ is normal, we use Serre's Criterion for normality, which requires that $A$ satisfies properties $R_1$ and $S_2$.\n1.  **$R_1$ (Regular in codimension 1):** Since $\\operatorname{Sing}(X) = \\{P\\}$ has codimension 2 in the 2-dimensional variety $X$ (dim $X = 3 - 1 = 2$), the singular locus does not contain any divisors. Thus, $X$ is regular in codimension 1.\n2.  **$S_2$ (Serre's condition $S_2$):** Since $A$ is a hypersurface in $\\mathbb{A}^3$, it is a complete intersection and therefore Cohen-Macaulay. Cohen-Macaulay rings satisfy condition $S_k$ for all $k \\le \\dim A$. Since $\\dim A = 2$, $A$ satisfies $S_2$.\n\nSince $A$ satisfies $R_1$ and $S_2$, $A$ is a normal domain.\n\n### 2. Computing $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$\n\nWe compute the Weil divisor class group $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$ using the exact sequence relating the class group of $A$ to an open subset. Let $U = X \\setminus V(x) \\subset X$. This corresponds to the localization $A_x = A[1/x]$.\n\n**Analyzing the Localization $A_x$**\nIn the ring $A_x$, $x$ is a unit. From the relation $xy = z^n$, we can write $y = x^{-1}z^n$.\nThus, we have an isomorphism:\n$$ A_x = k[x, y, z, x^{-1}] / (y - x^{-1}z^n) \\cong k[x, x^{-1}, z]. $$\nThe ring $k[x, x^{-1}, z]$ is the localization of the polynomial ring $k[x, z]$ at the multiplicative set generated by $x$. Since $k[x, z]$ is a Unique Factorization Domain (UFD), its localization $A_x$ is also a UFD.\nTherefore, $\\mathrm{Cl}(A_x) = 0$.\n\n**Nagata's Sequence**\nWe have the exact sequence:\n$$ \\bigoplus_{\\mathfrak{p} \\in Z} \\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{\\text{div}} \\mathrm{Cl}(A) \\to \\mathrm{Cl}(A_x) \\to 0, $$\nwhere $Z$ is the set of height-1 prime ideals of $A$ containing $x$.\nThe ideal $(x) \\subset A$ is defined by $x=0$. In $A$, $x=0 \\implies z^n = 0 \\implies z=0$.\nSo $V(x)$ is supported on the set $x=z=0$.\nConsider the ideal $\\mathfrak{p} = (x, z)$.\n- $\\mathfrak{p}$ is prime because $A/\\mathfrak{p} \\cong k[x,y,z]/(x, z, xy-z^n) \\cong k[y]$, which is a domain.\n- $\\mathfrak{p}$ has height 1 in $A$ (as it corresponds to a line in a surface).\n- Any prime ideal containing $x$ must contain $z$ (since $z^n \\in (x)$). Thus $\\mathfrak{p} = (x,z)$ is the unique height-1 prime containing $x$.\n\nThe sequence becomes:\n$$ \\mathbb{Z} \\cdot [D] \\xrightarrow{\\phi} \\mathrm{Cl}(A) \\to 0 $$\nwhere $D$ is the divisor corresponding to $\\mathfrak{p}$.\nThis implies $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$ is generated by the class $[D]$. The map $\\phi$ sends $1$ to $[div(x)]$. Since $div(x)$ is a principal divisor, it is zero in $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$. Thus, we need to find the relation imposed by $div(x)$ on the generator $[D]$.\n\n### 3. Order of $[D]$\n\nWe analyze the divisor of the function $x$ in $A$.\nSince $V(x)$ is supported solely on $D$, we have $div(x) = m D$ for some integer $m$.\nTo find $m$, we compute the valuation of $x$ in the discrete valuation ring $A_{\\mathfrak{p}}$.\nIn $A_{\\mathfrak{p}}$, $\\mathfrak{p}A_{\\mathfrak{p}} = (x, z)$.\nNotice that $y \\notin \\mathfrak{p}$ implies $y$ is a unit in $A_{\\mathfrak{p}}$.\nThe relation $x = y^{-1} z^n$ holds in $A_{\\mathfrak{p}}$.\nSince $y^{-1}$ is a unit, $x$ and $z^n$ are associates.\nThe maximal ideal is $\\mathfrak{m} = (x, z) = (z^n, z) = (z)$.\nThus, $z$ is a uniformizing parameter for $A_{\\mathfrak{p}}$, so $v_{\\mathfrak{p}}(z) = 1$.\nIt follows that $v_{\\mathfrak{p}}(x) = v_{\\mathfrak{p}}(y^{-1} z^n) = 0 + n \\cdot v_{\\mathfrak{p}}(z) = n$.\nTherefore, $div(x) = n D$.\nIn the class group $\\mathrm{Cl}(A) = \\mathrm{Div}(A) / \\mathrm{P}(A)$, we have $[div(x)] = 0$, so $n[D] = 0$.\nThis shows that $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$ is a quotient of $\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n**Proving the Order is Exactly $n$**\nWe must show that $k[D] \\neq 0$ for any $1 \\le k < n$.\nSuppose $k[D] = 0$. This implies that $k D$ is a principal divisor.\nLet $k D = div(f)$ for some $f \\in \\operatorname{Frac}(A)$.\nSince $div(f)$ is effective and supported only on $D$ (which is in the complement of $U$), $f$ must be regular on $U = \\operatorname{Spec}(A_x)$ and a unit there.\nThe units of $A_x \\cong k[x, x^{-1}, z]$ are of the form $c x^j$ for $c \\in k^\\times$ and $j \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nSo, $f = c x^j$ for some integer $j$.\nThen $div(f) = div(c x^j) = j \\cdot div(x) = j n D$.\nWe assumed $div(f) = k D$.\nComparing coefficients (since $D$ is a basis for the free group of divisors supported on $D$), we have $k = j n$.\nThus, $n$ must divide $k$.\nThe smallest positive integer $k$ for which this holds is $k=n$.\nTherefore, the order of $[D]$ is exactly $n$.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe class group $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$ is a cyclic group of order $n$, generated by $[D]$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n1.  **Normal Domain and Singular Locus:** $A$ is a normal domain because $xy-z^n$ is irreducible (Eisenstein) and $X$ satisfies Serre's criterion ($R_1$ due to codimension 2 singularity, $S_2$ due to being a hypersurface).

Basis and Multiplication Table\n\n**Dimension and Basis:**\nThe algebra $A$ is defined as the quotient of the free algebra $k\\langle x, y \\rangle$ by the two-sided ideal $I$ generated by $x^2, y^2,$ and $xy+yx$.\nConsider the set of monomials in the generators $x$ and $y$.

Then $yx = -w$.\n\nLet us examine products of length $\\geq 3$:\n- $xyx = x(yx) = x(-xy) = -x^2y = 0$.\n- $xyy = x(y^2) = 0$.\n- $yxy = y(-yx) = -y^2x = 0$.\n- $yyx = y^2x = 0$.\n\nSince any monomial of degree $\\geq 3$ must contain a square of a generator or can be rearranged (up to sign) to contain one, all terms of degree $\\geq 3$ are zero in $A$. The surviving monomials span the vector space:\n- Degree 0: $1$\n- Degree 1: $x, y$\n- Degree 2: $xy = w$\n\nThus, the set $\\mathcal{B} = \\{1, x, y, w\\}$ spans $A$. To show linear independence, we observe that $A$ is isomorphic to the exterior algebra $\\Lambda(k^2)$, which has dimension $2^2=4$. Alternatively, we can verify independence by mapping $A$ to the algebra of $2 \\times 2$ matrices over $k$ (though $A$ is not isomorphic to $M_2(k)$ as it is not simple) or simply noting that no relation equates a term of degree $k$ to terms of different degrees. Thus, $\\dim_k(A) = 4$.\n\n**Multiplication Table:**\nUsing the relations $x^2=0, y^2=0, yx=-xy=-w$, and the fact that degree $\\geq 3$ terms are zero (implying $xw=yw=wx=wy=w^2=0$), the multiplication table for the basis $\\{1, x, y, w\\}$ is:\n\n| $\\cdot$ | $1$ | $x$ | $y$ | $w$ |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| **$1$** | $1$ | $x$ | $y$ | $w$ |\n| **$x$** | $x$ | $0$ | $w$ | $0$ |\n| **$y$** | $y$ | $-w$ | $0$ | $0$ |\n| **$w$** | $w$ | $0$ | $0$ | $0$ |\n\n---\n\n### 2. Jacobson Radical and Ideals\n\n**Jacobson Radical $J(A)$:**\nLet $I = (x, y)$ be the two-sided ideal generated by $x$ and $y$. As a vector space, $I = \\operatorname{span}_k(x, y, w)$.\nComputing powers of $I$:\n- $I^2$ is spanned by products of generators $\\{x, y\\}$: $x^2=0, xy=w, yx=-w, y^2=0$. Thus $I^2 = (w) = \\operatorname{span}_k(w)$.\n- $I^3 = I \\cdot I^2 = \\operatorname{span}_k(x, y) \\cdot \\operatorname{span}_k(w)$. Since $xw=yw=0$, $I^3 = 0$.\n\nSince $I$ is a nilpotent ideal, $I \\subseteq J(A)$.\nThe quotient $A/I$ is isomorphic to $k$ (via the map sending $c_0 + c_1x + c_2y + c_3w \\mapsto c_0$). Since $k$ is a field, $A/I$ is a simple semisimple algebra. Therefore, $J(A) = I = \\operatorname{span}_k(x, y, w)$.\n\n**Powers of $J(A)$:**\n- $J(A) = \\operatorname{span}_k(x, y, w)$\n- $J(A)^2 = \\operatorname{span}_k(w)$\n- $J(A)^3 = \\{0\\}$\n\n**Local Algebra:**\nAn algebra $A$ is local if $A/J(A)$ is a division ring. Here $A/J(A) \\cong k$, which is a field. Thus, $A$ is a local algebra.\n\n**Classification of Two-Sided Ideals:**\nLet $K$ be a two-sided ideal of $A$.\n1. If $K \\not\\subseteq J(A)$, then $K$ contains an element with a non-zero scalar part (a unit), so $K = A$.\n2. Assume $K \\subseteq J(A)$.\n   - If $K \\subseteq J(A)^2 = (w)$, then $K$ is a subspace of a 1-dimensional space. The possibilities are $K = \\{0\\}$ or $K = (w)$.\n   - If $K \\not\\subseteq (w)$, let $z \\in K \\setminus (w)$. We can write $z = ax + by + cw$ with $a,b,c \\in k$ and $(a,b) \\neq (0,0)$.\n     Compute products with generators:\n     $x z = x(ax + by + cw) = b(xy) = bw$.\n     $y z = y(ax + by + cw) = a(yx) = -aw$.\n     Since $\\operatorname{char}(k) \\neq 2$ and $(a,b) \\neq (0,0)$, at least one of $bw$ or $-aw$ is non-zero. Since $K$ is an ideal, $w \\in K$.\n     Consequently, if $K$ is a non-zero ideal not contained in $(w)$, then $(w) \\subset K \\subseteq J(A)$.\n\n   By the Correspondence Theorem, ideals $K$ such that $(w) \\subset K \\subseteq J(A)$ correspond to subspaces of $J(A)/(w) \\cong \\operatorname{span}_k(\\bar{x}, \\bar{y})$. The subspaces of this 2-dimensional vector space are:\n   - The zero subspace (corresponds to $K=(w)$).\n   - The whole space (corresponds to $K=J(A)$).\n   - 1-dimensional lines. A line is spanned by $\\bar{u} = a\\bar{x} + b\\bar{y}$ for $[a:b] \\in \\mathbb{P}^1(k)$. The corresponding ideal is generated by $ax+by$ and $w$. Note that the ideal generated by just $ax+by$ contains $(ax+by)y = aw$ (or $-bw$ via $x$), so it automatically contains $w$ as long as $a,b$ are not both 0. Thus, these are the principal ideals $(ax+by)$.\n\n**List of all two-sided ideals:**\n1. The zero ideal: $\\{0\\}$.\n2. The ideal generated by $w$: $J(A)^2 = (w)$.\n3. The principal ideals $I_{a,b} = (ax + by)$ for each point $[a:b] \\in \\mathbb{P}^1(k)$.\n4. The maximal ideal: $J(A) = (x, y)$.\n5. The whole algebra: $A$.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Computation of the Center $Z(A)$\n\nLet $z = c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 y + c_3 w$ be an arbitrary element of $A$. For $z$ to be in the center, it must commute with the generators $x$ and $y$.\n1. Commutation with $x$:\n   $$[x, z] = c_1[x, x] + c_2[x, y] + c_3[x, w] = 0 + c_2(2w) + 0 = 2c_2 w.$$\n   Since $\\operatorname{char}(k) \\neq 2$, $[x, z] = 0 \\implies c_2 = 0$.\n2. Commutation with $y$:\n   With $c_2 = 0$, let $z = c_0 + c_1 x + c_3 w$.\n   $$[y, z] = c_1[y, x] + c_3[y, w] = c_1(-2w) + 0 = -2c_1 w.$$\n   Since $\\operatorname{char}(k) \\neq 2$, $[y, z] = 0 \\implies c_1 = 0$.\n\nThus, $z = c_0 + c_3 w$. These elements commute with $x$ and $y$ (and clearly $w$ since $w \\in Z(A)$ is trivial as $wJ(A) = J(A)w = 0$).\n**Conclusion:**\n$$Z(A) = \\operatorname{span}_k(1, w).$$\n\n---\n\n### 4. Automorphisms\n\nLet $\\varphi \\in \\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A)$.\n1. **Invariance:** $\\varphi$ must map the radical $J(A)$ to itself and $J(A)^2=(w)$ to itself.\n   Since $\\varphi(1)=1$, $\\varphi$ is determined by its action on $x$ and $y$.\n   Let:\n   $$ \\varphi(x) = ax + by + \\alpha w $$\n   $$ \\varphi(y) = cx + dy + \\beta w $$\n   for scalars $a,b,c,d,\\alpha,\\beta \\in k$.\n\n2. **Homomorphism Conditions:** We check if these definitions preserve the relations $x^2=0, y^2=0, xy+yx=0$.\n   Recall that $u^2=0$ for any $u \\in J(A)$.\n   - $\\varphi(x)^2 = (ax + by + \\alpha w)^2 = (ax+by)^2 = a^2x^2 + ab(xy+yx) + b^2y^2 = 0$. (Satisfied)\n   - $\\varphi(y)^2 = 0$. (Satisfied by symmetry)\n   - $\\varphi(x)\\varphi(y) + \\varphi(y)\\varphi(x) = 0$:\n     $$ \\varphi(x)\\varphi(y) = (ax+by)(cx+dy) = acx^2 + adxy + bcyx + bdy^2 = (ad-bc)w $$\n     $$ \\varphi(y)\\varphi(x) = (cx+dy)(ax+by) = cax^2 + cbxy + dayx + dby^2 = (cb-da)w $$\n     Sum: $((ad-bc) + (cb-da))w = 0$. (Satisfied)\n\n   Additionally, $\\varphi(w) = \\varphi(xy) = \\varphi(x)\\varphi(y) = (ad-bc)w$.\n\n3. **Bijectivity Condition:**\n   For $\\varphi$ to be an automorphism, the induced map on the vector space $J(A)/J(A)^2$ (with basis $\\bar{x}, \\bar{y}$) must be invertible. The matrix of this map is $M = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$ (acting on the basis $x,y$).\n   Thus, we require $\\det(M) = ad-bc \\neq 0$.\n   If this holds, $\\varphi$ maps $w \\to \\det(M)w \\neq 0$, so the restriction to $(w)$ is an isomorphism. By the 5-lemma or dimension counting, $\\varphi$ is an isomorphism on $A$.\n   The scalars are uniquely determined by the image of the basis elements.\n\n4. **Exact Sequence:**\n   Let $G = \\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A)$. We established a map $\\pi: G \\to \\mathrm{GL}_2(k)$ sending $\\varphi$ to $\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$.\n   - **Surjectivity:** For any $M \\in \\mathrm{GL}_2(k)$, setting $\\alpha=\\beta=0$ defines a valid automorphism.\n   - **Kernel:** The kernel $K = \\ker(\\pi)$ consists of automorphisms where $a=1, d=1, b=0, c=0$.\n     $$ \\varphi(x) = x + \\alpha w, \\quad \\varphi(y) = y + \\beta w $$\n     Composing two such maps:\n     $$ \\varphi_2(\\varphi_1(x)) = \\varphi_2(x + \\alpha_1 w) = (x + \\alpha_2 w) + \\alpha_1 \\varphi_2(w) $$\n     Since $\\varphi(w) = (1\\cdot1 - 0\\cdot0)w = w$ for maps in the kernel,\n     $$ \\varphi_2(\\varphi_1(x)) = x + (\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2)w $$\n     Similarly for $y$. This shows $K \\cong (k^2, +)$.\n\n   Thus, we have the short exact sequence:\n   $$ 1 \\longrightarrow k^2 \\longrightarrow \\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A) \\xrightarrow{\\;\\pi\\;} \\mathrm{GL}_2(k) \\longrightarrow 1 $$\n\n   **Splitting:**\n   The map $s: \\mathrm{GL}_2(k) \\to \\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A)$ defined by $s(M) = \\varphi$ with $\\varphi(x) = ax+by, \\varphi(y) = cx+dy$ (i.e., $\\alpha=\\beta=0$) is a group homomorphism:\n   The linear part of the composition is simply matrix multiplication, and with zero $w$-components, no \"cross-terms\" generating $w$ shifts arise.\n   Since $\\pi \\circ s = \\operatorname{id}_{\\mathrm{GL}_2(k)}$, the sequence splits.\n\n**Final Result:**\nThe group of automorphisms is the semidirect product $k^2 \\rtimes \\mathrm{GL}_2(k)$, where $\\mathrm{GL}_2(k)$ acts on $k^2$ via the determinant scaled action (specifically, if $\\varphi_v \\in k^2$ and $\\varphi_M \\in \\mathrm{GL}_2$, $\\varphi_M \\circ \\varphi_v \\circ \\varphi_M^{-1}$ corresponds to the action of $M$ on $v$ scaled by $\\det(M)^{-1}$). However, the question asks only to deduce the split exact sequence, which is:\n$$\n1\\to k^2 \\to \\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A)\\to \\mathrm{GL}_2(k)\\to 1.\n$$",

By the 5-lemma or dimension counting, $\\varphi$ is an isomorphism on $A$.\n   The scalars are uniquely determined by the image of the basis elements.\n\n4. **Exact Sequence:**\n   Let $G = \\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A)$. We established a map $\\pi: G \\to \\mathrm{GL}_2(k)$ sending $\\varphi$ to $\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$.\n   - **Surjectivity:** For any $M \\in \\mathrm{GL}_2(k)$, setting $\\alpha=\\beta=0$ defines a valid automorphism.\n   - **Kernel:** The kernel $K = \\ker(\\pi)$ consists of automorphisms where $a=1, d=1, b=0, c=0$.\n     $$ \\varphi(x) = x + \\alpha w, \\quad \\varphi(y) = y + \\beta w $$\n     Composing two such maps:\n     $$ \\varphi_2(\\varphi_1(x)) = \\varphi_2(x + \\alpha_1 w) = (x + \\alpha_2 w) + \\alpha_1 \\varphi_2(w) $$\n     Since $\\varphi(w) = (1\\cdot1 - 0\\cdot0)w = w$ for maps in the kernel,\n     $$ \\varphi_2(\\varphi_1(x)) = x + (\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2)w $$\n     Similarly for $y$. This shows $K \\cong (k^2, +)$.\n\n   Thus, we have the short exact sequence:\n   $$ 1 \\longrightarrow k^2 \\longrightarrow \\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A) \\xrightarrow{\\;\\pi\\;} \\mathrm{GL}_2(k) \\longrightarrow 1 $$\n\n   **Splitting:**\n   The map $s: \\mathrm{GL}_2(k) \\to \\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A)$ defined by $s(M) = \\varphi$ with $\\varphi(x) = ax+by, \\varphi(y) = cx+dy$ (i.e., $\\alpha=\\beta=0$) is a group homomorphism:\n   The linear part of the composition is simply matrix multiplication, and with zero $w$-components, no \"cross-terms\" generating $w$ shifts arise.\n   Since $\\pi \\circ s = \\operatorname{id}_{\\mathrm{GL}_2(k)}$, the sequence splits.\n\n**Final Result:**\nThe group of automorphisms is the semidirect product $k^2 \\rtimes \\mathrm{GL}_2(k)$, where $\\mathrm{GL}_2(k)$ acts on $k^2$ via the determinant scaled action (specifically, if $\\varphi_v \\in k^2$ and $\\varphi_M \\in \\mathrm{GL}_2$, $\\varphi_M \\circ \\varphi_v \\circ \\varphi_M^{-1}$ corresponds to the action of $M$ on $v$ scaled by $\\det(M)^{-1}$). However, the question asks only to deduce the split exact sequence, which is:\n$$\n1\\to k^2 \\to \\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A)\\to \\mathrm{GL}_2(k)\\to 1.\n$$",

Since $\\operatorname{char}(F) \\neq 2$, $1/4 \\neq 0$. Thus, the expressions are unequal, and $(J, \\circ)$ is not associative.\n\n***\n\n### 3. Determination of all $F$-linear Derivations\n\nWe define a derivation $D: J \\to J$ as an $F$-linear map satisfying:\n$$\nD(X \\circ Y) = D(X) \\circ Y + X \\circ D(Y).\n$$\n\n**Step 1: Verify that $D_C(X) = CX - XC$ is a derivation.**\nLet $C \\in M_2(F)$. We compute the action of $D_C$ on the product $X \\circ Y$:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nD_C(X \\circ Y) &= [C, \\frac{1}{2}(XY + YX)] \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2} ([C, XY] + [C, YX]) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2} ( (CXY - XYC) + (CYX - YXC) ).\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nNow compute the RHS of the derivation property:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nD_C(X) \\circ Y + X \\circ D_C(Y) &= [C, X] \\circ Y + X \\circ [C, Y] \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2} ( (CX-XC)Y + Y(CX-XC) ) + \\frac{1}{2} ( X(CY-YC) + (CY-YC)X ) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2} ( CXY - XCY + YCX - YXC + XCY - XYC + CYX - YCX ) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2} ( CXY - XYC + CYX - YXC ).\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nThe expressions match. Thus, $D_C$ is a derivation for any matrix $C$.\n\n**Step 2: Uniqueness of the traceless matrix $C$.**\nSuppose $D_C(X) = [C, X]$. We restrict $C$ to be traceless ($\\operatorname{tr}(C)=0$).\nIf $D_C(X) = 0$ for all $X$, then $C$ commutes with all matrices in $M_2(F)$. By Schur's Lemma (or direct calculation), $C$ must be a scalar matrix, $C = \\lambda I$.\nThe condition $\\operatorname{tr}(C) = 0$ implies $\\operatorname{tr}(\\lambda I) = 2\\lambda = 0$. Since $\\operatorname{char}(F) \\neq 2$, $\\lambda = 0$, so $C=0$.\nThus, the map from traceless matrices to derivations is injective.\n\n**Step 3: Show every derivation is of the form $D_C$.**\nLet $D$ be an arbitrary derivation on $J$.\nSince $I$ is the identity for $\\circ$ (and $I^2=I$), $D(I) = D(I \\circ I) = D(I) \\circ I + I \\circ D(I) = 2D(I)$. This implies $D(I) = 0$.\n\nLet $D(E_{11}) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha & \\beta \\\\ \\gamma & \\delta \\end{pmatrix}$.\nUsing $E_{11} \\circ E_{11} = E_{11}$, we have $D(E_{11}) = 2 E_{11} \\circ D(E_{11})$.\nCalculating $2 E_{11} \\circ D(E_{11})$ yields $\\begin{pmatrix} 2\\alpha & \\beta \\\\ \\gamma & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nEquating this to $D(E_{11})$, we get $\\alpha = 2\\alpha \\implies \\alpha = 0$ and $\\delta = 0$.\nSo, $D(E_{11}) = \\beta E_{12} + \\gamma E_{21}$.\nSince $D(I) = 0$ and $I = E_{11} + E_{22}$, we have $D(E_{22}) = -D(E_{11}) = -\\beta E_{12} - \\gamma E_{21}$.\n\nNext, let $D(E_{12}) = \\begin{pmatrix} x & y \\\\ z & w \\end{pmatrix}$.\nUsing $E_{12} \\circ E_{12} = 0$, we have $0 = 2 E_{12} \\circ D(E_{12})$.\nComputation shows $E_{12} \\circ M = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} m_{21} & m_{11} + m_{22} \\\\ 0 & m_{21} \\end{pmatrix}$.\nFor this to be 0, $z = 0$ and $x + w = 0 \\implies w = -x$.\nSo, $D(E_{12}) = x(E_{11} - E_{22}) + y E_{12}$.\n\nSimilarly, using $E_{21} \\circ E_{21} = 0$, we find $D(E_{21}) = a(E_{11} - E_{22}) + c E_{21}$ for scalars $a, c$.\n\nWe use the mixed product relations to relate these coefficients:\n1. $E_{11} \\circ E_{12} = \\frac{1}{2} E_{12}$. Apply $D$:\n   $$ D(E_{11}) \\circ E_{12} + E_{11} \\circ D(E_{12}) = \\frac{1}{2} D(E_{12}). $$\n   LHS: $(\\beta E_{12} + \\gamma E_{21}) \\circ E_{12} + E_{11} \\circ (x(E_{11}-E_{22}) + y E_{12})$.\n   Note $E_{21} \\circ E_{12} = \\frac{1}{2}I$ and $E_{12} \\circ E_{12} = 0$.\n   LHS reduces to $\\frac{\\gamma}{2} I + x E_{11} + \\frac{y}{2} E_{12}$.\n   RHS is $\\frac{1}{2} (x E_{11} - x E_{22} + y E_{12})$.\n   Comparing coefficients of $E_{11}$: $\\frac{\\gamma}{2} + x = \\frac{x}{2} \\implies \\frac{\\gamma}{2} = -\\frac{x}{2} \\implies \\gamma = -x$.\n\n2. $E_{11} \\circ E_{21} = \\frac{1}{2} E_{21}$. Apply $D$:\n   Similar calculation yields $\\beta = -a$.\n\n3. $E_{12} \\circ E_{21} = \\frac{1}{2} I$. Apply $D$:\n   $$ D(E_{12}) \\circ E_{21} + E_{12} \\circ D(E_{21}) = 0. $$\n   Substituting the forms derived:\n   $(x(E_{11}-E_{22}) + y E_{12}) \\circ E_{21} + E_{12} \\circ (a(E_{11}-E_{22}) + c E_{21}) = 0$.\n   $(x(E_{11} \\circ E_{21} - E_{22} \\circ E_{21}) + \\frac{y}{2} I) + (a(E_{12} \\circ E_{11} - E_{12} \\circ E_{22}) + \\frac{c}{2} I) = 0$.\n   Note $E_{11} \\circ E_{21} = \\frac{1}{2} E_{21}$ and $E_{22} \\circ E_{21} = \\frac{1}{2} E_{21}$, so the terms with $x$ cancel. Similarly, terms with $a$ cancel.\n   We are left with $\\frac{y}{2} I + \\frac{c}{2} I = 0 \\implies c = -y$.\n\nThus, any derivation $D$ is completely determined by the three parameters $x, a, y$:\n- $D(E_{11}) = -a E_{12} - x E_{21}$\n- $D(E_{12}) = x(E_{11} - E_{22}) + y E_{12}$\n- $D(E_{21}) = a(E_{11} - E_{22}) - y E_{21}$\n- $D(E_{22}) = a E_{12} + x E_{21}$\n\nWe construct the matrix $C$:\n$$ C = \\begin{pmatrix} y/2 & a \\\\ -x & -y/2 \\end{pmatrix}. $$\nCheck $D_C(E_{12}) = [C, E_{12}] = C E_{12} - E_{12} C = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & y/2 \\\\ 0 & -x \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} -x & -y/2 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} x & y \\\\ 0 & -x \\end{pmatrix} = x(E_{11}-E_{22}) + y E_{12}$.\nThis matches the general form of $D$. Similar checks hold for other basis elements.\nSince $C$ is constructed from arbitrary parameters of $D$, every derivation is of the form $D_C$. The matrix $C$ constructed is traceless.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nEvery derivation $D$ is of the form $D_C(X) = CX - XC$ for a unique $C \\in \\mathfrak{sl}_2(F)$ (the Lie algebra of traceless $2 \\times 2$ matrices).\nThe map $\\psi: \\mathfrak{sl}_2(F) \\to \\operatorname{Der}(J)$ defined by $C \\mapsto D_C$ is:\n1. Linear.\n2. Injective (kernel is trivial).\n3. Surjective (as shown above).\n4. A Lie algebra homomorphism:\n   $$ [D_A, D_B](X) = D_A(D_B(X)) - D_B(D_A(X)) = [A, [B, X]] - [B, [A, X]] = [[A, B], X] = D_{[A, B]}(X). $$\nTherefore,\n$$ \\operatorname{Der}(J) \\cong \\mathfrak{sl}_2(F). $$",

This implies $D(I) = 0$.\n\nLet $D(E_{11}) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha & \\beta \\\\ \\gamma & \\delta \\end{pmatrix}$.\nUsing $E_{11} \\circ E_{11} = E_{11}$, we have $D(E_{11}) = 2 E_{11} \\circ D(E_{11})$.\nCalculating $2 E_{11} \\circ D(E_{11})$ yields $\\begin{pmatrix} 2\\alpha & \\beta \\\\ \\gamma & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nEquating this to $D(E_{11})$, we get $\\alpha = 2\\alpha \\implies \\alpha = 0$ and $\\delta = 0$.\nSo, $D(E_{11}) = \\beta E_{12} + \\gamma E_{21}$.\nSince $D(I) = 0$ and $I = E_{11} + E_{22}$, we have $D(E_{22}) = -D(E_{11}) = -\\beta E_{12} - \\gamma E_{21}$.\n\nNext, let $D(E_{12}) = \\begin{pmatrix} x & y \\\\ z & w \\end{pmatrix}$.\nUsing $E_{12} \\circ E_{12} = 0$, we have $0 = 2 E_{12} \\circ D(E_{12})$.\nComputation shows $E_{12} \\circ M = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} m_{21} & m_{11} + m_{22} \\\\ 0 & m_{21} \\end{pmatrix}$.\nFor this to be 0, $z = 0$ and $x + w = 0 \\implies w = -x$.\nSo, $D(E_{12}) = x(E_{11} - E_{22}) + y E_{12}$.\n\nSimilarly, using $E_{21} \\circ E_{21} = 0$, we find $D(E_{21}) = a(E_{11} - E_{22}) + c E_{21}$ for scalars $a, c$.\n\nWe use the mixed product relations to relate these coefficients:\n1. $E_{11} \\circ E_{12} = \\frac{1}{2} E_{12}$. Apply $D$:\n   $$ D(E_{11}) \\circ E_{12} + E_{11} \\circ D(E_{12}) = \\frac{1}{2} D(E_{12}). $$\n   LHS: $(\\beta E_{12} + \\gamma E_{21}) \\circ E_{12} + E_{11} \\circ (x(E_{11}-E_{22}) + y E_{12})$.\n   Note $E_{21} \\circ E_{12} = \\frac{1}{2}I$ and $E_{12} \\circ E_{12} = 0$.\n   LHS reduces to $\\frac{\\gamma}{2} I + x E_{11} + \\frac{y}{2} E_{12}$.\n   RHS is $\\frac{1}{2} (x E_{11} - x E_{22} + y E_{12})$.\n   Comparing coefficients of $E_{11}$: $\\frac{\\gamma}{2} + x = \\frac{x}{2} \\implies \\frac{\\gamma}{2} = -\\frac{x}{2} \\implies \\gamma = -x$.\n\n2. $E_{11} \\circ E_{21} = \\frac{1}{2} E_{21}$. Apply $D$:\n   Similar calculation yields $\\beta = -a$.\n\n3. $E_{12} \\circ E_{21} = \\frac{1}{2} I$. Apply $D$:\n   $$ D(E_{12}) \\circ E_{21} + E_{12} \\circ D(E_{21}) = 0. $$\n   Substituting the forms derived:\n   $(x(E_{11}-E_{22}) + y E_{12}) \\circ E_{21} + E_{12} \\circ (a(E_{11}-E_{22}) + c E_{21}) = 0$.\n   $(x(E_{11} \\circ E_{21} - E_{22} \\circ E_{21}) + \\frac{y}{2} I) + (a(E_{12} \\circ E_{11} - E_{12} \\circ E_{22}) + \\frac{c}{2} I) = 0$.\n   Note $E_{11} \\circ E_{21} = \\frac{1}{2} E_{21}$ and $E_{22} \\circ E_{21} = \\frac{1}{2} E_{21}$, so the terms with $x$ cancel. Similarly, terms with $a$ cancel.\n   We are left with $\\frac{y}{2} I + \\frac{c}{2} I = 0 \\implies c = -y$.\n\nThus, any derivation $D$ is completely determined by the three parameters $x, a, y$:\n- $D(E_{11}) = -a E_{12} - x E_{21}$\n- $D(E_{12}) = x(E_{11} - E_{22}) + y E_{12}$\n- $D(E_{21}) = a(E_{11} - E_{22}) - y E_{21}$\n- $D(E_{22}) = a E_{12} + x E_{21}$\n\nWe construct the matrix $C$:\n$$ C = \\begin{pmatrix} y/2 & a \\\\ -x & -y/2 \\end{pmatrix}. $$\nCheck $D_C(E_{12}) = [C, E_{12}] = C E_{12} - E_{12} C = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & y/2 \\\\ 0 & -x \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} -x & -y/2 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} x & y \\\\ 0 & -x \\end{pmatrix} = x(E_{11}-E_{22}) + y E_{12}$.\nThis matches the general form of $D$. Similar checks hold for other basis elements.\nSince $C$ is constructed from arbitrary parameters of $D$, every derivation is of the form $D_C$. The matrix $C$ constructed is traceless.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nEvery derivation $D$ is of the form $D_C(X) = CX - XC$ for a unique $C \\in \\mathfrak{sl}_2(F)$ (the Lie algebra of traceless $2 \\times 2$ matrices).\nThe map $\\psi: \\mathfrak{sl}_2(F) \\to \\operatorname{Der}(J)$ defined by $C \\mapsto D_C$ is:\n1. Linear.\n2. Injective (kernel is trivial).\n3. Surjective (as shown above).\n4. A Lie algebra homomorphism:\n   $$ [D_A, D_B](X) = D_A(D_B(X)) - D_B(D_A(X)) = [A, [B, X]] - [B, [A, X]] = [[A, B], X] = D_{[A, B]}(X). $$\nTherefore,\n$$ \\operatorname{Der}(J) \\cong \\mathfrak{sl}_2(F). $$",

Structure of Automorphisms and Action on Elements\n\n**Claim 1:** Any automorphism $\\varphi \\in \\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)$ fixes the elements $\\pm 1$ and permutes the set of elements of order 4, $S = \\{\\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k\\}$.\n\n**Proof:**\nLet $\\varphi$ be an automorphism of $Q_8$. Group automorphisms preserve the order of elements. We examine the orders of elements in $Q_8$:\n- The identity $1$ is the unique element of order 1. Thus, $\\varphi(1) = 1$.\n- $(-1)^2 = 1$ and $-1 \\neq 1$, so $-1$ has order 2. In $Q_8$, for any $x \\in \\{\\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k\\}$, $x^2 = -1 \\neq 1$, so these elements have order 4. Thus, $-1$ is the **unique** element of order 2 in $Q_8$.\n- Therefore, $\\varphi(-1) = -1$.\n\nConsequently, $\\varphi$ fixes the set $\\{\\pm 1\\}$ pointwise.\n\nThe remaining six elements $\\{\\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k\\}$ all have order 4. Since automorphisms map elements of order 4 to elements of order 4, $\\varphi$ must map the set $S = \\{\\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k\\}$ to itself. Thus, $\\varphi$ permutes these six elements.\n\n***\n\n### 2. Determination of $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)$ and its Order\n\n**Claim 2:** An automorphism is uniquely determined by the images of $i$ and $j$. The order of the automorphism group is $|\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)| = 24$.\n\n**Proof:**\nSince $Q_8$ is generated by $i$ and $j$ (as $k = ij$ and $-1 = i^2$), any homomorphism from $Q_8$ is uniquely determined by the images of these generators.\n\nLet $\\varphi \\in \\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)$. Let $u = \\varphi(i)$ and $v = \\varphi(j)$.\nFor $\\varphi$ to be a valid automorphism, $u$ and $v$ must satisfy the defining relations of $Q_8$:\n1.  $u^4 = 1, v^4 = 1$ (orders must divide 4, and since $\\varphi$ is an automorphism, orders must be exactly 4).\n2.  $u^2 = v^2 = -1$ (images of $-1$ must be $-1$).\n3.  $vu = -uv$ (anti-commutativity).\n\nAdditionally, since $\\varphi$ must be surjective, $u$ and $v$ must generate $Q_8$.\n\n**Analysis of Choices:**\n1.  **Choice for $u$:** $\\varphi(i)$ can be any element of order 4.\n    There are 6 elements of order 4 in $Q_8$. Thus, there are **6 choices** for $u$.\n    \n2.  **Choice for $v$:** $\\varphi(j)$ must be an element of order 4 such that $v \\notin \\langle u \\rangle$.\n    *   If $v \\in \\langle u \\rangle$, then $v$ commutes with $u$ (since $\\langle u \\rangle$ is cyclic).

Automorphisms preserve the order of elements.\n1.  **Order 1:** The identity $1$ is the unique element of order 1. Thus $\\varphi(1) = 1$.\n2.  **Order 2:** In $Q_8$, $(-1)^2 = 1$. For any $x \\in \\{\\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k\\}$, $x^2 = -1 \\neq 1$. Thus, $-1$ is the unique element of order 2. Therefore, $\\varphi(-1) = -1$.\n3.  **Order 4:** The remaining six elements $S = \\{\\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k\\}$ all have order 4 (since $(\\pm x)^2 = -1$). As $\\varphi$ is a bijection preserving orders, it must map $S$ to itself.\n\nThus, $\\varphi$ fixes $\\{\\pm 1\\}$ pointwise and permutes $S$.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Determination of $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)$ and its Order\n\n**Claim:** An automorphism is determined by the images of $i$ and $j$, and $|\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)| = 24$.\n\n**Proof:**\nSince $k = ij$ and $-1 = i^2$, the group $Q_8$ is generated by $\\{i, j\\}$. Any homomorphism is uniquely determined by the images of the generators.\nLet $\\varphi \\in \\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)$. Let $u = \\varphi(i)$ and $v = \\varphi(j)$.\nSince $\\varphi$ is an automorphism:\n1.  $u$ and $v$ must have order 4.\n2.  $\\varphi$ must be surjective, so $\\langle u, v \\rangle = Q_8$.\n\n**Counting valid pairs $(u, v)$:**\n*   **Choice for $u$:** $u$ can be any element of order 4. The set $S$ has 6 elements, so there are **6 choices**.\n*   **Choice for $v$:** $v$ must be an element of order 4 such that $v \\notin \\langle u \\rangle$.\n    *   The subgroup $\\langle u \\rangle = \\{1, u, -1, -u\\}$ contains exactly 2 elements of order 4 ($u$ and $-u$).\n    *   If $v \\in \\langle u \\rangle$, then $\\langle u, v \\rangle = \\langle u \\rangle \\cong C_4 \\neq Q_8$.\n    *   If $v \\in S \\setminus \\langle u \\rangle$, then $v$ and $u$ do not commute (as they generate different cyclic subgroups of order 4 in a non-abelian group), satisfying the relations $u^2=v^2=-1$ and $vu = -uv$. Thus they generate $Q_8$.\n    *   There are $6 - 2 = 4$ elements in $S \\setminus \\langle u \\rangle$. Thus, there are **4 choices** for $v$.\n\n**Total Count:**\nThe number of valid generating pairs is $6 \\times 4 = 24$. Thus, $|\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)| = 24$.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Inner Automorphisms and Action on Cyclic Subgroups\n\n**Claim:** $\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8) \\cong V_4$, and the action on cyclic subgroups yields a surjective homomorphism $\\Psi: \\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8) \\to S_3$ with kernel $\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8)$.\n\n**Proof:**\nThe inner automorphism group is $\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8) \\cong Q_8 / Z(Q_8)$.\nThe center is $Z(Q_8) = \\{1, -1\\}$. The quotient $Q_8/\\{\\pm 1\\}$ has order 4 and elements $\\{[\\pm 1], [\\pm i], [\\pm j], [\\pm k]\\}$. Since $x^2 = -1 \\in Z(Q_8)$ for all $x \\in Q_8$, every element in the quotient has order dividing 2. The unique group of order 4 with exponent 2 is the Klein four-group $V_4$.\nThe elements of $\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8)$ are explicitly:\n*   $\\operatorname{id}$ (conjugation by $\\pm 1$)\n*   $c_i$ (conjugation by $\\pm i$): $i \\mapsto i, j \\mapsto -j, k \\mapsto -k$.\n*   $c_j$ (conjugation by $\\pm j$): $i \\mapsto -i, j \\mapsto j, k \\mapsto -k$.\n*   $c_k$ (conjugation by $\\pm k$): $i \\mapsto -i, j \\mapsto -j, k \\mapsto k$.\n\n**Action on Cyclic Subgroups:**\nLet $X = \\{\\langle i \\rangle, \\langle j \\rangle, \\langle k \\rangle\\}$ be the set of subgroups of order 4. An automorphism $\\varphi$ maps subgroups to subgroups of the same order, defining a homomorphism $\\Psi: \\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8) \\to S_X \\cong S_3$.\n\n**Surjectivity:**\n*   Consider $\\tau$ defined by $\\tau(i)=j, \\tau(j)=i$. Then $\\tau(k)=-k$. This maps $\\langle i \\rangle \\leftrightarrow \\langle j \\rangle$ and fixes $\\langle k \\rangle$. This is a transposition in $S_3$.\n*   Consider $\\rho$ defined by $\\rho(i)=j, \\rho(j)=k$. Then $\\rho(k)=i$. This maps $\\langle i \\rangle \\to \\langle j \\rangle \\to \\langle k \\rangle \\to \\langle i \\rangle$. This is a 3-cycle.\nGenerating a transposition and 3-cycle implies $\\operatorname{Im}(\\Psi) = S_3$.\n\n**Kernel:**\nThe kernel consists of $\\varphi$ such that $\\varphi(\\langle x \\rangle) = \\langle x \\rangle$ for all $x \\in \\{i, j, k\\}$.\n$\\varphi(\\langle i \\rangle) = \\langle i \\rangle \\implies \\varphi(i) \\in \\{\\pm i\\}$. Similarly $\\varphi(j) \\in \\{\\pm j\\}$.\nChecking the 4 combinations of signs:\n1.  $i \\mapsto i, j \\mapsto j \\implies \\operatorname{id}$\n2.  $i \\mapsto i, j \\mapsto -j \\implies k \\mapsto -k \\implies c_i$\n3.  $i \\mapsto -i, j \\mapsto j \\implies k \\mapsto -k \\implies c_j$\n4.  $i \\mapsto -i, j \\mapsto -j \\implies k \\mapsto k \\implies c_k$\nThese are exactly the elements of $\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8)$. Thus $\\ker(\\Psi) = \\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8)$.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Conclusion: Isomorphism to $S_4$\n\n**Claim:** $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8) \\cong S_4$.\n\n**Proof:**\nLet $G = \\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)$ and $N = \\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8) \\cong V_4$. Since $N \\unlhd G$, $G$ acts on $N$ by conjugation. This defines a homomorphism:\n$$ \\theta: G \\to \\operatorname{Aut}(N). $$\nSince $N \\cong V_4$, $\\operatorname{Aut}(N) \\cong \\operatorname{Aut}(V_4) \\cong S_3$.\n\n**Kernel of the Action:**\nThe kernel is the centralizer $C_G(N) = \\{ \\varphi \\in G \\mid \\varphi \\sigma \\varphi^{-1} = \\sigma, \\forall \\sigma \\in N \\}$.\nRecall that elements of $N$ are conjugations $c_g$ for $g \\in Q_8$. The conjugation action satisfies $\\varphi c_g \\varphi^{-1} = c_{\\varphi(g)}$.\nThus, $\\varphi \\in C_G(N) \\iff c_{\\varphi(g)} = c_g$ for all $g \\in Q_8$.\nThe equality $c_x = c_y$ holds if and only if $xy^{-1} \\in Z(Q_8) = \\{\\pm 1\\}$.\nTherefore, $\\varphi \\in C_G(N)$ implies $\\varphi(g) = \\pm g$ for all $g$.\nAs shown in Part 3 (Analysis of Kernel), the set of automorphisms satisfying $\\varphi(g) \\in \\{\\pm g\\}$ is exactly $N = \\{ \\operatorname{id}, c_i, c_j, c_k \\}$.\nThus, $C_G(N) = N$.\n\n**Isomorphism to Holomorph:**\nWe have a group $G$ with a normal abelian subgroup $N \\cong V_4$ such that $C_G(N) = N$.\nUnder these conditions ($N$ is abelian and self-centralizing in $G$), $G$ acts faithfully on $N$ via conjugation (identifying $N$ with its translation action on itself) and embeds into the **holomorph** of $N$:\n$$ G \\hookrightarrow \\operatorname{Hol}(N) \\cong N \\rtimes \\operatorname{Aut}(N). $$\nSubstituting $N \\cong V_4$:\n$$ \\operatorname{Hol}(V_4) \\cong V_4 \\rtimes S_3. $$\nThis semidirect product is isomorphic to the symmetric group $S_4$ (specifically, the affine group $\\operatorname{AGL}(2, 2)$).\nWe know from Part 2 that $|G| = 24$. The order of the holomorph is $|V_4| \\cdot |S_3| = 4 \\times 6 = 24$.\nSince $G$ embeds into a group of the same finite order, the embedding must be an isomorphism.\n\nTherefore, $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8) \\cong S_4$.",

The connected subgroups of $S^1$ are the trivial subgroup $\\{1\\}$ and $S^1$ itself.\n\n**Case 1: $\\pi(N) = \\{1\\}$.**\nThen $N \\subseteq \\ker(\\pi) = T$. Thus, $N$ is a closed connected subgroup of the vector space $\\mathbb{R}^2$, i.e., a linear subspace. Since $N$ is normal in $G$, it must be invariant under conjugation by elements of $G$.

Assuming the interchange of differentiation and integration is valid, we have:\n$$\nI_n = J'(1).\n$$\n\n### 2. Convergence Analysis\n\nFirst, we determine the domain of $s$ for which $J(s)$ converges.\n- As $x \\to 0^+$, the integrand behaves like $x^{s-1}$. Convergence requires $s-1 > -1$, or $s > 0$.\n- As $x \\to \\infty$, the integrand behaves like $\\frac{x^{s-1}}{x^n} = x^{s-n-1}$. Convergence requires $s-n-1 < -1$, or $s < n$.\n\nThus, $J(s)$ converges for $0 < s < n$. Since $n \\ge 2$, the value $s=1$ lies strictly within this interval.

Recall the definition of the domain:\n$$D = \\{(z,w) \\in \\Delta^2 : |z| > r \\text{ or } |w| < s\\}.$$\nConsider the intersection of $D$ with vertical lines $\\{z\\} \\times \\mathbb{C}$. For any fixed $z \\in \\Delta_1$ (where $\\Delta_1 = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z|<1\\}$), the set of $w$ such that $(z,w) \\in D$ always includes the disk $\\Delta_s = \\{w : |w| < s\\}$.\nSince $f$ is holomorphic on $D$, for every fixed $z \\in \\Delta_1$, the function $w \\mapsto f(z,w)$ is holomorphic on $\\Delta_s$. We can expand this function in a Taylor series centered at $w=0$:\n$$ f(z,w) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty c_n(z) w^n \\quad \\text{for } |w| < s. $$\nThe coefficients $c_n(z)$ are given by the Cauchy integral formula:\n$$ c_n(z) = \\frac{1}{n!} \\frac{\\partial^n f}{\\partial w^n}(z,0) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\int_{|\\zeta| = \\rho_0} \\frac{f(z,\\zeta)}{\\zeta^{n+1}} d\\zeta, $$\nwhere $0 < \\rho_0 < s$ is a fixed radius. Since the integration path $\\{z\\} \\times \\{|\\zeta|=\\rho_0\\}$ lies completely inside $D$ for all $z \\in \\Delta_1$, and the integrand is holomorphic with respect to $z$, the coefficients $c_n(z)$ are holomorphic functions on the entire unit disk $\\Delta_1$.\n\n**Step 2: Extension of Convergence via Maximum Modulus Principle**\nWe now show that the series $\\sum c_n(z) w^n$ actually converges for all $(z,w) \\in \\Delta^2$. It suffices to show that the radius of convergence of the series in $w$ is at least $1$ for every $z$.\n\nLet $\\rho$ be an arbitrary radius such that $s < \\rho < 1$.\nConsider the annulus in the $z$-plane defined by $A = \\{z : r < |z| < 1\\}$.\nFor any $z \\in A$, the condition $|z| > r$ is satisfied, implying that the entire vertical disk $\\{w : |w| < 1\\}$ is contained in $D$. Consequently, the circle $\\{w : |w| = \\rho\\}$ is contained in $D$.\nThus, for $z \\in A$, we can represent the coefficients using the larger contour $|\\zeta| = \\rho$:\n$$ c_n(z) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\int_{|\\zeta| = \\rho} \\frac{f(z,\\zeta)}{\\zeta^{n+1}} d\\zeta. $$\nLet $\\delta > 0$ be small enough such that $r < 1-\\delta$.

Let $M_{\\rho, \\delta}$ be the maximum modulus of $f$ on this set:\n$$ M_{\\rho, \\delta} = \\sup \\{ |f(z,w)| : |z| = 1-\\delta, |w| = \\rho \\}. $$\nUsing the integral estimate for $z$ on the circle $|z| = 1-\\delta$:\n$$ |c_n(z)| \\le \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\frac{M_{\\rho, \\delta}}{\\rho^{n+1}} \\cdot 2\\pi \\rho = \\frac{M_{\\rho, \\delta}}{\\rho^n}. $$\nSince $c_n(z)$ is holomorphic on the disk $\\{z : |z| \\le 1-\\delta\\}$, the Maximum Modulus Principle implies that the maximum of $|c_n(z)|$ occurs on the boundary. Therefore, the inequality holds for the interior as well:\n$$ |c_n(z)| \\le \\frac{M_{\\rho, \\delta}}{\\rho^n} \\quad \\text{for all } |z| \\le 1-\\delta. $$\n\n**Step 3: Convergence and Definition of F**\nFix an arbitrary $z_0 \\in \\Delta_1$. We can choose $\\delta$ small enough such that $|z_0| < 1-\\delta$. The estimate above shows that for any $\\rho < 1$:\n$$ \\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} |c_n(z_0)|^{1/n} \\le \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left( \\frac{M_{\\rho, \\delta}}{\\rho^n} \\right)^{1/n} = \\frac{1}{\\rho}. $$\nSince $\\rho$ can be chosen arbitrarily close to $1$, we have:\n$$ \\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} |c_n(z_0)|^{1/n} \\le 1. $$\nBy the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem, the radius of convergence of the series $\\sum c_n(z_0) w^n$ is at least $1$.\nWe define the function $F$ on $\\Delta^2$ by:\n$$ F(z,w) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty c_n(z) w^n. $$\nTo prove $F$ is holomorphic on $\\Delta^2$, we verify uniform convergence on compact subsets.

Choosing $\\rho$ such that $\\rho' < \\rho < 1$, the estimate $|c_n(z)| \\le M \\rho^{-n}$ holds. Then for $(z,w) \\in K$:\n$$ |c_n(z) w^n| \\le M \\rho^{-n} (\\rho')^n = M \\left(\\frac{\\rho'}{\\rho}\\right)^n. $$\nSince $\\rho'/\\rho < 1$, the series $\\sum M (\\rho'/\\rho)^n$ converges. By the Weierstrass M-test, the series for $F$ converges uniformly on $K$. Thus $F$ is holomorphic on $\\Delta^2$.\n\n**Step 4: Uniqueness**\nBy construction, $F(z,w) = f(z,w)$ for all $(z,w) \\in \\Delta_1 \\times \\Delta_s$. This set is a non-empty open subset of the connected domain $D$. By the identity theorem for holomorphic functions, $F$ coincides with $f$ on all of $D$.\nSince $D$ is open in $\\Delta^2$ and $\\Delta^2$ is connected, any holomorphic extension to $\\Delta^2$ is uniquely determined by its values on $D$. Thus, $F$ is the unique extension.\n\n### Part 2: Envelope of Holomorphy\n\n**Conclusion:** The envelope of holomorphy of $D$ is exactly $\\Delta^2$.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n1.  **Extension:** We proved in Part 1 that every function $f \\in \\mathcal{O}(D)$ extends to a function $F \\in \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta^2)$.

Since $\\det(A) \\neq 0$, the linear map $L: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$ defined by $L(x) = Ax$ is a bijection.

Setting $y=0$:\n$$ f(x) = f(x)f(0) + f'(x)f'(0) = f(x)(1) + f'(x)(0) = f(x). $$\nThis provides no contradiction.\n\nSince $f$ is $C^3$, we can differentiate $(*)$ with respect to $y$:\n$$ f'(x+y) = f(x)f'(y) + f'(x)f''(y). \\quad (1) $$\nSetting $y=0$ in $(1)$:\n$$ f'(x) = f(x)f'(0) + f'(x)f''(0) = f'(x)f''(0). $$\nRearranging this yields:\n$$ f'(x) [ 1 - f''(0) ] = 0. $$\nThis equation must hold for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This leads to two possible cases:\n1.  $f'(x) = 0$ for all $x$.\n2.  $f''(0) = 1$.\n\n### Step 2: Analysis of Case 1 ($f'(x) = 0$)\n\nIf $f'(x) = 0$ for all $x$, then $f(x)$ is a constant function.\nUsing $f(0)=1$, we have $f(x) = 1$ for all $x$.\nWe verify this solution in $(*)$:\n$$ \\text{LHS} = f(x+y) = 1. $$\n$$ \\text{RHS} = f(x)f(y) + f'(x)f'(y) = 1 \\cdot 1 + 0 \\cdot 0 = 1. $$\nThe equation holds. Thus, **$f(x) = 1$ is a solution**.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of Case 2 ($f''(0) = 1$)\n\nAssume $f''(0) = 1$. Differentiate equation $(1)$ with respect to $y$:\n$$ f''(x+y) = f(x)f''(y) + f'(x)f'''(y). \\quad (2) $$\nSetting $y=0$ in $(2)$:\n$$ f''(x) = f(x)f''(0) + f'(x)f'''(0). $$\nUsing $f''(0)=1$, and letting $\\lambda = f'''(0)$ (a real constant), we obtain a second-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$ f''(x) - \\lambda f'(x) - f(x) = 0. $$\nThe initial conditions are $f(0)=1$ and $f'(0)=0$.\n\nThe characteristic equation of this ODE is $r^2 - \\lambda r - 1 = 0$.\nThe discriminant is $\\Delta = \\lambda^2 + 4$, which is strictly positive for all real $\\lambda$. Thus, there are two distinct real roots $r_1$ and $r_2$:\n$$ r_1 = \\frac{\\lambda + \\sqrt{\\lambda^2+4}}{2}, \\quad r_2 = \\frac{\\lambda - \\sqrt{\\lambda^2+4}}{2}. $$\nNote that $r_1 r_2 = -1$ and $r_1 + r_2 = \\lambda$. Since $r_1 r_2 = -1$, neither root is zero.\n\nThe general solution is $f(x) = c_1 e^{r_1 x} + c_2 e^{r_2 x}$.\nUsing the initial conditions:\n1. $f(0) = c_1 + c_2 = 1$.\n2. $f'(0) = c_1 r_1 + c_2 r_2 = 0 \\implies c_2 = -c_1 \\frac{r_1}{r_2}$.\n\nSubstituting $c_2$ into the first equation:\n$$ c_1 \\left( 1 - \\frac{r_1}{r_2} \\right) = 1 \\implies c_1 \\frac{r_2 - r_1}{r_2} = 1 \\implies c_1 = \\frac{r_2}{r_2 - r_1}. $$\nThen $c_2 = 1 - c_1 = 1 - \\frac{r_2}{r_2 - r_1} = \\frac{-r_1}{r_2 - r_1} = \\frac{r_1}{r_1 - r_2}$.\nSubstituting these back into $f(x)$:\n$$ f(x) = \\frac{r_2 e^{r_1 x} - r_1 e^{r_2 x}}{r_2 - r_1} = \\frac{r_1 e^{r_2 x} - r_2 e^{r_1 x}}{r_1 - r_2}. $$\nLet $a = r_1$. Then $r_2 = -1/a$. Since roots are real and their product is $-1$, we can parametrize the roots by a non-zero real number $a$. Substituting $r_1=a$ and $r_2=-1/a$:\n$$ f(x) = \\frac{a e^{-x/a} - (-1/a) e^{ax}}{a - (-1/a)} = \\frac{a e^{-x/a} + \\frac{1}{a} e^{ax}}{a + \\frac{1}{a}} = \\frac{a^2 e^{-x/a} + e^{ax}}{a^2 + 1}. $$\nThis form is valid for any $a \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$.

Setting $y=0$:\n$$ f(x) = f(x)f(0) + f'(x)f'(0) = f(x)(1) + f'(x)(0) = f(x). $$\nThis provides no contradiction.\n\nSince $f$ is $C^3$, we can differentiate $(*)$ with respect to $y$:\n$$ f'(x+y) = f(x)f'(y) + f'(x)f''(y). \\quad (1) $$\nSetting $y=0$ in $(1)$:\n$$ f'(x) = f(x)f'(0) + f'(x)f''(0) = f'(x)f''(0). $$\nRearranging this yields:\n$$ f'(x) [ 1 - f''(0) ] = 0. $$\nThis equation must hold for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This leads to two possible cases:\n1.  $f'(x) = 0$ for all $x$.\n2.  $f''(0) = 1$.\n\n### Step 2: Analysis of Case 1 ($f'(x) = 0$)\n\nIf $f'(x) = 0$ for all $x$, then $f(x)$ is a constant function.\nUsing $f(0)=1$, we have $f(x) = 1$ for all $x$.\nWe verify this solution in $(*)$:\n$$ \\text{LHS} = f(x+y) = 1. $$\n$$ \\text{RHS} = f(x)f(y) + f'(x)f'(y) = 1 \\cdot 1 + 0 \\cdot 0 = 1. $$\nThe equation holds. Thus, **$f(x) = 1$ is a solution**.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of Case 2 ($f''(0) = 1$)\n\nAssume $f''(0) = 1$. Differentiate equation $(1)$ with respect to $y$:\n$$ f''(x+y) = f(x)f''(y) + f'(x)f'''(y). \\quad (2) $$\nSetting $y=0$ in $(2)$:\n$$ f''(x) = f(x)f''(0) + f'(x)f'''(0). $$\nUsing $f''(0)=1$, and letting $\\lambda = f'''(0)$ (a real constant), we obtain a second-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$ f''(x) - \\lambda f'(x) - f(x) = 0. $$\nThe initial conditions are $f(0)=1$ and $f'(0)=0$.\n\nThe characteristic equation of this ODE is $r^2 - \\lambda r - 1 = 0$.\nThe discriminant is $\\Delta = \\lambda^2 + 4$, which is strictly positive for all real $\\lambda$. Thus, there are two distinct real roots $r_1$ and $r_2$:\n$$ r_1 = \\frac{\\lambda + \\sqrt{\\lambda^2+4}}{2}, \\quad r_2 = \\frac{\\lambda - \\sqrt{\\lambda^2+4}}{2}. $$\nNote that $r_1 r_2 = -1$ and $r_1 + r_2 = \\lambda$. Since $r_1 r_2 = -1$, neither root is zero.\n\nThe general solution is $f(x) = c_1 e^{r_1 x} + c_2 e^{r_2 x}$.\nUsing the initial conditions:\n1. $f(0) = c_1 + c_2 = 1$.\n2. $f'(0) = c_1 r_1 + c_2 r_2 = 0 \\implies c_2 = -c_1 \\frac{r_1}{r_2}$.\n\nSubstituting $c_2$ into the first equation:\n$$ c_1 \\left( 1 - \\frac{r_1}{r_2} \\right) = 1 \\implies c_1 \\frac{r_2 - r_1}{r_2} = 1 \\implies c_1 = \\frac{r_2}{r_2 - r_1}. $$\nThen $c_2 = 1 - c_1 = 1 - \\frac{r_2}{r_2 - r_1} = \\frac{-r_1}{r_2 - r_1} = \\frac{r_1}{r_1 - r_2}$.\nSubstituting these back into $f(x)$:\n$$ f(x) = \\frac{r_2 e^{r_1 x} - r_1 e^{r_2 x}}{r_2 - r_1} = \\frac{r_1 e^{r_2 x} - r_2 e^{r_1 x}}{r_1 - r_2}. $$\nLet $a = r_1$. Then $r_2 = -1/a$. Since roots are real and their product is $-1$, we can parametrize the roots by a non-zero real number $a$. Substituting $r_1=a$ and $r_2=-1/a$:\n$$ f(x) = \\frac{a e^{-x/a} - (-1/a) e^{ax}}{a - (-1/a)} = \\frac{a e^{-x/a} + \\frac{1}{a} e^{ax}}{a + \\frac{1}{a}} = \\frac{a^2 e^{-x/a} + e^{ax}}{a^2 + 1}. $$\nThis form is valid for any $a \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$. Note that replacing $a$ with $-1/a$ yields the same function, reflecting the symmetry of the roots.\n\n### Step 4: Verification\n\nWe verify if this family of functions satisfies $(*)$.\nLet $f(x) = \\frac{a^2 e^{-x/a} + e^{ax}}{a^2 + 1}$.\nThen $f'(x) = \\frac{1}{a^2 + 1} \\left( -a e^{-x/a} + a e^{ax} \\right) = \\frac{a}{a^2 + 1} \\left( e^{ax} - e^{-x/a} \\right)$.\n\nCompute the RHS of $(*)$:\n$$ f(x)f(y) = \\frac{1}{(a^2+1)^2} (a^2 e^{-x/a} + e^{ax})(a^2 e^{-y/a} + e^{ay}) $$\n$$ = \\frac{1}{(a^2+1)^2} \\left( a^4 e^{-(x+y)/a} + a^2 e^{-x/a+ay} + a^2 e^{ax-y/a} + e^{a(x+y)} \\right). $$\n\n$$ f'(x)f'(y) = \\frac{a^2}{(a^2+1)^2} (e^{ax} - e^{-x/a})(e^{ay} - e^{-y/a}) $$\n$$ = \\frac{1}{(a^2+1)^2} \\left( a^2 e^{a(x+y)} - a^2 e^{ax-y/a} - a^2 e^{-x/a+ay} + a^2 e^{-(x+y)/a} \\right). $$\n\nAdding these:\n$$ f(x)f(y) + f'(x)f'(y) = \\frac{1}{(a^2+1)^2} \\left( (a^4+a^2) e^{-(x+y)/a} + (1+a^2) e^{a(x+y)} \\right). $$\nThe cross terms $e^{-x/a+ay}$ and $e^{ax-y/a}$ cancel out.\n$$ = \\frac{1}{(a^2+1)^2} \\left( a^2(a^2+1) e^{-(x+y)/a} + (a^2+1) e^{a(x+y)} \\right) $$\n$$ = \\frac{1}{a^2+1} \\left( a^2 e^{-(x+y)/a} + e^{a(x+y)} \\right) = f(x+y). $$\nThe verification is successful.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe solutions are the constant function $f(x)=1$ and the family of exponential sums derived above. Note that $f(x)=1$ is not contained in the family $f_a(x)$ for any real $a \\neq 0$ (though it is a limit as $a \\to \\infty$ in a specific sense, it is formally distinct as a solution to the derived ODE).\n\nThus, the set of all such functions is:\n\n1.  $$ f(x) = 1 $$\n2.  $$ f(x) = \\frac{a^2 e^{-x/a} + e^{ax}}{a^2 + 1} $$\n    where $a$ is any non-zero real constant.\n\n(Note: For $a=1$, this gives $f(x) = \\cosh x$.)",

Unique Extension to $L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n)$**\nThe Schwartz space $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ is dense in $L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n)$. By the **Bounded Linear Transformation (BLT) Theorem**, any bounded linear operator $T$ defined on a dense subspace of a Banach space extends uniquely to a bounded linear operator on the entire space, preserving the operator norm.\n\nTherefore, $R_j$ extends uniquely to a bounded linear operator $R_j: L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\to L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n)$. For any $f \\in L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n)$, this extension is given by the Fourier multiplier definition $R_j f = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}(m_j \\widehat{f})$, since the Fourier transform $\\mathcal{F}$ is a unitary isomorphism on $L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ and multiplication by $m_j \\in L^\\infty(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ is a bounded operator.\n\n**3. Computation of the Operator Norm**\nThe norm of a Fourier multiplier operator on $L^2$ is given by the $L^\\infty$ norm of its multiplier. We have established $\\|R_j\\|_{L^2 \\to L^2} \\le 1$. To show equality, we verify that the supremum of $|m_j(\\xi)|$ is 1.\n\nConsider points $\\xi$ on the $j$-th coordinate axis, specifically $\\xi = e_j = (0, \\dots, 1, \\dots, 0)$. For such $\\xi$, $|\\xi| = 1$ and $\\xi_j = 1$.\n$$\n|m_j(e_j)| = \\frac{|1|}{1} = 1.\n$$\nSince $|m_j(\\xi)|$ achieves the value 1 on a set of positive measure (any cone around the $e_j$ axis approaches 1, or specifically, $|m_j(\\xi)|=1$ on the entire punctured axis $\\mathbb{R}e_j \\setminus \\{0\\}$), the essential supremum is:\n$$\n\\|m_j\\|_{L^\\infty} = 1.\n$$\nTherefore, the operator norm is:\n$$\n\\|R_j\\|_{L^2 \\to L^2} = 1.\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Part 2: Proof of $L^2$ Identities\n\nWe now prove the two requested identities for arbitrary $f \\in L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n)$.\n\n**1. Proof of $\\sum_{j=1}^n \\|R_j f\\|_{L^2}^2 = \\|f\\|_{L^2}^2$**\n\nUsing the Plancherel theorem, we express the squared norm of $R_j f$:\n$$\n\\|R_j f\\|_{L^2}^2 = \\|\\widehat{R_j f}\\|_{L^2}^2 = \\|m_j \\widehat{f}\\|_{L^2}^2 = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} |m_j(\\xi)|^2 |\\widehat{f}(\\xi)|^2 \\, d\\xi.\n$$\nSumming over $j=1$ to $n$:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^n \\|R_j f\\|_{L^2}^2 = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} |m_j(\\xi)|^2 |\\widehat{f}(\\xi)|^2 \\, d\\xi.\n$$\nSince the integrands are non-negative, we can interchange the finite sum and the integral:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^n \\|R_j f\\|_{L^2}^2 = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^n |m_j(\\xi)|^2 \\right) |\\widehat{f}(\\xi)|^2 \\, d\\xi.\n$$\nWe evaluate the sum of the squared moduli of the multipliers for $\\xi \\neq 0$:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^n |m_j(\\xi)|^2 = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\left| -i \\frac{\\xi_j}{|\\xi|} \\right|^2 = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\frac{\\xi_j^2}{|\\xi|^2} = \\frac{1}{|\\xi|^2} \\sum_{j=1}^n \\xi_j^2.\n$$\nBy the definition of the Euclidean norm, $\\sum_{j=1}^n \\xi_j^2 = |\\xi|^2$. Thus, for $\\xi \\neq 0$:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^n |m_j(\\xi)|^2 = \\frac{|\\xi|^2}{|\\xi|^2} = 1.\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the integral (noting the set $\\{\\xi=0\\}$ is negligible):\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^n \\|R_j f\\|_{L^2}^2 = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} 1 \\cdot |\\widehat{f}(\\xi)|^2 \\, d\\xi = \\|\\widehat{f}\\|_{L^2}^2.\n$$\nBy Plancherel's theorem, $\\|\\widehat{f}\\|_{L^2}^2 = \\|f\\|_{L^2}^2$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^n \\|R_j f\\|_{L^2}^2 = \\|f\\|_{L^2}^2.\n$$\n\n**2. Proof of $\\sum_{j=1}^n R_j^2 f = -f$**\n\nWe interpret the operator sum via the Fourier transform. The operator $R_j^2$ is the composition $R_j \\circ R_j$. The multiplier for the composition of two multiplier operators is the product of their multipliers.\n$$\n\\widehat{R_j^2 f}(\\xi) = m_j(\\xi) \\cdot \\widehat{R_j f}(\\xi) = m_j(\\xi) \\cdot m_j(\\xi) \\widehat{f}(\\xi) = [m_j(\\xi)]^2 \\widehat{f}(\\xi).\n$$\nWe calculate the square of the multiplier $m_j(\\xi)$ for $\\xi \\neq 0$:\n$$\n[m_j(\\xi)]^2 = \\left( -i \\frac{\\xi_j}{|\\xi|} \\right)^2 = (-i)^2 \\frac{\\xi_j^2}{|\\xi|^2} = - \\frac{\\xi_j^2}{|\\xi|^2}.\n$$\nNow consider the operator $S = \\sum_{j=1}^n R_j^2$. By linearity of the Fourier transform, the Fourier transform of $Sf$ is:\n$$\n\\widehat{Sf}(\\xi) = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\widehat{R_j^2 f}(\\xi) = \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^n [m_j(\\xi)]^2 \\right) \\widehat{f}(\\xi).\n$$\nWe evaluate the sum of the squared multipliers for $\\xi \\neq 0$:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^n [m_j(\\xi)]^2 = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\left( - \\frac{\\xi_j^2}{|\\xi|^2} \\right) = - \\frac{1}{|\\xi|^2} \\sum_{j=1}^n \\xi_j^2 = - \\frac{|\\xi|^2}{|\\xi|^2} = -1.\n$$\nThus, we have:\n$$\n\\widehat{Sf}(\\xi) = -1 \\cdot \\widehat{f}(\\xi) = -\\widehat{f}(\\xi) \\quad \\text{almost everywhere}.\n$$\nApplying the inverse Fourier transform, we recover the function in $L^2$:\n$$\nSf = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}(-\\widehat{f}) = - \\mathcal{F}^{-1}(\\widehat{f}) = -f.\n$$\nThis proves the identity:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^n R_j^2 f = -f.\n$$\n\n### Conclusion\n\n1.

Unique Extension to $L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n)$**\nThe Schwartz space $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ is dense in $L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n)$. By the **Bounded Linear Transformation (BLT) Theorem**, any bounded linear operator $T$ defined on a dense subspace of a Banach space extends uniquely to a bounded linear operator on the entire space, preserving the operator norm.\n\nTherefore, $R_j$ extends uniquely to a bounded linear operator $R_j: L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\to L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n)$. For any $f \\in L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n)$, this extension is given by the Fourier multiplier definition $R_j f = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}(m_j \\widehat{f})$, since the Fourier transform $\\mathcal{F}$ is a unitary isomorphism on $L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ and multiplication by $m_j \\in L^\\infty(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ is a bounded operator.\n\n**3. Computation of the Operator Norm**\nThe norm of a Fourier multiplier operator on $L^2$ is given by the $L^\\infty$ norm of its multiplier. We have established $\\|R_j\\|_{L^2 \\to L^2} \\le 1$. To show equality, we verify that the supremum of $|m_j(\\xi)|$ is 1.\n\nConsider points $\\xi$ on the $j$-th coordinate axis, specifically $\\xi = e_j = (0, \\dots, 1, \\dots, 0)$. For such $\\xi$, $|\\xi| = 1$ and $\\xi_j = 1$.\n$$\n|m_j(e_j)| = \\frac{|1|}{1} = 1.\n$$\nSince $|m_j(\\xi)|$ achieves the value 1 on a set of positive measure (any cone around the $e_j$ axis approaches 1, or specifically, $|m_j(\\xi)|=1$ on the entire punctured axis $\\mathbb{R}e_j \\setminus \\{0\\}$), the essential supremum is:\n$$\n\\|m_j\\|_{L^\\infty} = 1.\n$$\nTherefore, the operator norm is:\n$$\n\\|R_j\\|_{L^2 \\to L^2} = 1.\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Part 2: Proof of $L^2$ Identities\n\nWe now prove the two requested identities for arbitrary $f \\in L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n)$.\n\n**1. Proof of $\\sum_{j=1}^n \\|R_j f\\|_{L^2}^2 = \\|f\\|_{L^2}^2$**\n\nUsing the Plancherel theorem, we express the squared norm of $R_j f$:\n$$\n\\|R_j f\\|_{L^2}^2 = \\|\\widehat{R_j f}\\|_{L^2}^2 = \\|m_j \\widehat{f}\\|_{L^2}^2 = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} |m_j(\\xi)|^2 |\\widehat{f}(\\xi)|^2 \\, d\\xi.\n$$\nSumming over $j=1$ to $n$:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^n \\|R_j f\\|_{L^2}^2 = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} |m_j(\\xi)|^2 |\\widehat{f}(\\xi)|^2 \\, d\\xi.\n$$\nSince the integrands are non-negative, we can interchange the finite sum and the integral:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^n \\|R_j f\\|_{L^2}^2 = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^n |m_j(\\xi)|^2 \\right) |\\widehat{f}(\\xi)|^2 \\, d\\xi.\n$$\nWe evaluate the sum of the squared moduli of the multipliers for $\\xi \\neq 0$:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^n |m_j(\\xi)|^2 = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\left| -i \\frac{\\xi_j}{|\\xi|} \\right|^2 = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\frac{\\xi_j^2}{|\\xi|^2} = \\frac{1}{|\\xi|^2} \\sum_{j=1}^n \\xi_j^2.\n$$\nBy the definition of the Euclidean norm, $\\sum_{j=1}^n \\xi_j^2 = |\\xi|^2$. Thus, for $\\xi \\neq 0$:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^n |m_j(\\xi)|^2 = \\frac{|\\xi|^2}{|\\xi|^2} = 1.\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the integral (noting the set $\\{\\xi=0\\}$ is negligible):\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^n \\|R_j f\\|_{L^2}^2 = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} 1 \\cdot |\\widehat{f}(\\xi)|^2 \\, d\\xi = \\|\\widehat{f}\\|_{L^2}^2.\n$$\nBy Plancherel's theorem, $\\|\\widehat{f}\\|_{L^2}^2 = \\|f\\|_{L^2}^2$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^n \\|R_j f\\|_{L^2}^2 = \\|f\\|_{L^2}^2.\n$$\n\n**2. Proof of $\\sum_{j=1}^n R_j^2 f = -f$**\n\nWe interpret the operator sum via the Fourier transform. The operator $R_j^2$ is the composition $R_j \\circ R_j$. The multiplier for the composition of two multiplier operators is the product of their multipliers.\n$$\n\\widehat{R_j^2 f}(\\xi) = m_j(\\xi) \\cdot \\widehat{R_j f}(\\xi) = m_j(\\xi) \\cdot m_j(\\xi) \\widehat{f}(\\xi) = [m_j(\\xi)]^2 \\widehat{f}(\\xi).\n$$\nWe calculate the square of the multiplier $m_j(\\xi)$ for $\\xi \\neq 0$:\n$$\n[m_j(\\xi)]^2 = \\left( -i \\frac{\\xi_j}{|\\xi|} \\right)^2 = (-i)^2 \\frac{\\xi_j^2}{|\\xi|^2} = - \\frac{\\xi_j^2}{|\\xi|^2}.\n$$\nNow consider the operator $S = \\sum_{j=1}^n R_j^2$. By linearity of the Fourier transform, the Fourier transform of $Sf$ is:\n$$\n\\widehat{Sf}(\\xi) = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\widehat{R_j^2 f}(\\xi) = \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^n [m_j(\\xi)]^2 \\right) \\widehat{f}(\\xi).\n$$\nWe evaluate the sum of the squared multipliers for $\\xi \\neq 0$:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^n [m_j(\\xi)]^2 = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\left( - \\frac{\\xi_j^2}{|\\xi|^2} \\right) = - \\frac{1}{|\\xi|^2} \\sum_{j=1}^n \\xi_j^2 = - \\frac{|\\xi|^2}{|\\xi|^2} = -1.\n$$\nThus, we have:\n$$\n\\widehat{Sf}(\\xi) = -1 \\cdot \\widehat{f}(\\xi) = -\\widehat{f}(\\xi) \\quad \\text{almost everywhere}.\n$$\nApplying the inverse Fourier transform, we recover the function in $L^2$:\n$$\nSf = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}(-\\widehat{f}) = - \\mathcal{F}^{-1}(\\widehat{f}) = -f.\n$$\nThis proves the identity:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^n R_j^2 f = -f.\n$$\n\n### Conclusion\n\n1.  Each $R_j$ extends uniquely to a bounded linear operator on $L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ with operator norm **$\\|R_j\\|_{L^2\\to L^2} = 1$**.\n2.  The following identities hold for all $f \\in L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n)$:\n    $$\n    \\sum_{j=1}^n \\|R_j f\\|_{L^2}^2 = \\|f\\|_{L^2}^2\n    \\qquad \\text{and} \\qquad\n    \\sum_{j=1}^n R_j^2 f = -f.\n    $$",

The ODE is $f''(x) + k^2 f(x) = 0$, with general solution:\n$$ f(x) = A \\sin(kx) + B \\cos(kx). $$\nUsing the boundary conditions:\n1. $f(0) = B = 0 \\implies f(x) = A \\sin(kx)$.\n2. $f'(x) = Ak \\cos(kx)$, so $f'(1) = Ak \\cos(k) = 1$.\n\nTo determine $A$, we require the coefficient of $A$ to be non-zero.\n- **If $\\cos(k) \\neq 0$:**\n  $$ A = \\frac{1}{k \\cos(k)}. $$\n  The unique solution is:\n  $$ f(x) = \\frac{\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda} x)}{\\sqrt{\\lambda} \\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda})}. $$\n\n- **If $\\cos(k) = 0$:**\n  The condition becomes $A \\cdot k \\cdot 0 = 1$, which simplifies to $0 = 1$. This is a contradiction.\n  Therefore, no solution exists when $\\cos(k) = 0$.\n  Since $k > 0$, $\\cos(k) = 0$ implies $k = \\frac{(2n+1)\\pi}{2}$ for integers $n \\ge 0$.\n  In terms of $\\lambda$, solutions fail to exist when:\n  $$ \\lambda = k^2 = \\left( \\frac{(2n+1)\\pi}{2} \\right)^2, \\quad n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots $$\n\n### Conclusion\n\n**1. Values of $\\lambda$ for which a solution exists:**\nA continuous solution exists for all real $\\lambda$ except for the set of values $S$:\n$$ S = \\left\\{ \\left( \\frac{(2n+1)\\pi}{2} \\right)^2 \\;\\middle|\\; n \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\} \\right\\} = \\left\\{ \\frac{\\pi^2}{4}, \\frac{9\\pi^2}{4}, \\frac{25\\pi^2}{4}, \\dots \\right\\}. $$\nFormally, solutions exist for $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus S$.\n\n**2.

Let $u = y^{*\\prime\\prime}$ and $dv = h'' dx$, so $du = y^{*(3)} dx$ and $v = h'$.\n$$ I = \\left[ y^{*\\prime\\prime}(x) h'(x) \\right]_0^1 - \\int_0^1 y^{*(3)}(x) h'(x) \\, dx. $$\nSince $h'(1) = 0$ and $h'(0) = 0$, the boundary term vanishes.\n$$ I = - \\int_0^1 y^{*(3)}(x) h'(x) \\, dx. $$\nIntegrate by parts again.

Then $y^{*\\prime\\prime}(x) = 6Cx - 2D$.\nThe functional value is:\n$$ J[y^*] = \\int_0^1 (6Cx - 2D)^2 \\, dx = 4 \\int_0^1 (3Cx - D)^2 \\, dx. $$\nExpanding the square:\n$$ (3Cx - D)^2 = 9C^2 x^2 - 6CD x + D^2. $$\nIntegrating term by term:\n$$ \\int_0^1 (9C^2 x^2 - 6CD x + D^2) \\, dx = \\left[ 3C^2 x^3 - 3CD x^2 + D^2 x \\right]_0^1 $$\n$$ = 3C^2 - 3CD + D^2. $$\nSubstituting $C = p+q$ and $D = 2p+q$ back into this expression:\n1.  $C^2 = (p+q)^2 = p^2 + 2pq + q^2$\n2.  $D^2 = (2p+q)^2 = 4p^2 + 4pq + q^2$\n3.  $CD = (p+q)(2p+q) = 2p^2 + 3pq + q^2$\n\nNow calculate $3C^2 - 3CD + D^2$:\n$$ 3(p^2 + 2pq + q^2) - 3(2p^2 + 3pq + q^2) + (4p^2 + 4pq + q^2) $$\nGroup by terms ($p^2, pq, q^2$):\n- $p^2$: $3 - 6 + 4 = 1$\n- $pq$: $6 - 9 + 4 = 1$\n- $q^2$: $3 - 3 + 1 = 1$\n\nSo the integral part evaluates to $p^2 + pq + q^2$.\nFinally, multiply by the factor of 4 we factored out earlier:\n$$ \\min_{y\\in\\mathcal{A}}J[y] = 4(p^2 + pq + q^2). $$\n\n---\n\n### 3) Proof of Unique Global Minimizer\n\nWe prove that $y^*$ is the unique global minimizer using a direct variation argument. Let $y \\in \\mathcal{A}$ be any admissible function. We can write $y$ as:\n$$ y(x) = y^*(x) + h(x) $$\nwhere $h(x) = y(x) - y^*(x)$. Since both $y$ and $y^*$ are in $\\mathcal{A}$, the perturbation $h$ satisfies homogeneous boundary conditions:\n$$ h(0) = y(0) - y^*(0) = 0 $$\n$$ h(1) = y(1) - y^*(1) = 0 $$\n$$ h'(0) = y'(0) - y^{*\\prime}(0) = p - p = 0 $$\n$$ h'(1) = y'(1) - y^{*\\prime}(1) = q - q = 0 $$\nAlso, since $y \\in C^2([0,1])$ and $y^*$ is smooth, $h \\in C^2([0,1])$.\n\nNow, substitute $y = y^* + h$ into the functional:\n$$ J[y] = \\int_0^1 (y^{*\\prime\\prime}(x) + h''(x))^2 \\, dx $$\n$$ J[y] = \\int_0^1 (y^{*\\prime\\prime})^2 \\, dx + 2 \\int_0^1 y^{*\\prime\\prime} h'' \\, dx + \\int_0^1 (h'')^2 \\, dx $$\n$$ J[y] = J[y^*] + 2 \\int_0^1 y^{*\\prime\\prime} h'' \\, dx + J[h]. $$\n\nWe analyze the cross-term $I = \\int_0^1 y^{*\\prime\\prime}(x) h''(x) \\, dx$ using integration by parts. Let $u = y^{*\\prime\\prime}$ and $dv = h'' dx$, so $du = y^{*(3)} dx$ and $v = h'$.\n$$ I = \\left[ y^{*\\prime\\prime}(x) h'(x) \\right]_0^1 - \\int_0^1 y^{*(3)}(x) h'(x) \\, dx. $$\nSince $h'(1) = 0$ and $h'(0) = 0$, the boundary term vanishes.\n$$ I = - \\int_0^1 y^{*(3)}(x) h'(x) \\, dx. $$\nIntegrate by parts again. Let $u = y^{*(3)}$ and $dv = h' dx$, so $du = y^{*(4)} dx$ and $v = h$.\n$$ I = - \\left( \\left[ y^{*(3)}(x) h(x) \\right]_0^1 - \\int_0^1 y^{*(4)}(x) h(x) \\, dx \\right). $$\nUsing the boundary conditions $h(1)=0$ and $h(0)=0$, the boundary term vanishes.\nAdditionally, we found in part (1) that $y^*$ satisfies $y^{*(4)}(x) = 0$ everywhere.\n$$ I = \\int_0^1 0 \\cdot h(x) \\, dx = 0. $$\nTherefore, the functional simplifies to:\n$$ J[y] = J[y^*] + \\int_0^1 (h''(x))^2 \\, dx. $$\nSince $(h''(x))^2 \\geq 0$, we have:\n$$ J[y] \\geq J[y^*]. $$\nThis proves that $y^*$ is a global minimizer.\n\n**Uniqueness:**\nFor $J[y] = J[y^*]$, we require $\\int_0^1 (h''(x))^2 \\, dx = 0$. Since $h''$ is continuous (as $h \\in C^2$), this implies $h''(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in [0,1]$.\nIntegrating $h''(x) = 0$ twice gives:\n$$ h(x) = c_1 x + c_0. $$\nUsing the boundary conditions for $h$:\n- $h(0) = 0 \\implies c_0 = 0$.\n- $h'(0) = 0 \\implies c_1 = 0$.\nThus, $h(x) \\equiv 0$, which implies $y(x) \\equiv y^*(x)$.\nTherefore, $y^*$ is the unique global minimizer.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\n1.  **Minimizer:** $y^*(x) = (p+q)x^3 - (2p+q)x^2 + px$\n2.  **Minimum Value:** $4(p^2 + pq + q^2)$\n3.  **Proof:** Established via exact expansion and positivity of the second variation.",

Then there exist distinct points $p_1, p_2 \\in S$ such that their difference $p_1 - p_2$ is a vector with integer coordinates (i.e., $p_1 - p_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2$).\n\n**Proof of Lemma:**\n1.  Let $\\chi_S$ be the indicator function of the set $S$. We can express the area of $S$ as the integral of $\\chi_S$ over $\\mathbb{R}^2$:\n    $$ \\operatorname{area}(S) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^2} \\chi_S(x) \\, dx $$\n    \n2.  Decompose $\\mathbb{R}^2$ into a union of disjoint unit squares translated by integer vectors. Let $C_0 = [0, 1)^2$ be the fundamental domain. Then $\\mathbb{R}^2 = \\bigcup_{u \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2} (C_0 + u)$.\n    \n3.  Using the additivity of the integral over these disjoint regions:\n    $$ \\operatorname{area}(S) = \\sum_{u \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2} \\int_{C_0 + u} \\chi_S(x) \\, dx $$\n    \n4.

By the Monotone Convergence Theorem, we can interchange the sum and the integral:\n    $$ \\operatorname{area}(S) = \\int_{C_0} \\left( \\sum_{u \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2} \\chi_S(y + u) \\right) dy $$\n    \n6.  Define the function $f(y) = \\sum_{u \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2} \\chi_S(y + u)$ for $y \\in C_0$.\n    We have $\\int_{C_0} f(y) \\, dy = \\operatorname{area}(S)$.\n    Given the hypothesis $\\operatorname{area}(S) > 1$ and $\\operatorname{area}(C_0) = 1$, it is impossible for $f(y) \\le 1$ almost everywhere.

Then there exist distinct points $p_1, p_2 \\in S$ such that their difference $p_1 - p_2$ is a vector with integer coordinates (i.e., $p_1 - p_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2$).\n\n**Proof of Lemma:**\n1.  Let $\\chi_S$ be the indicator function of the set $S$. We can express the area of $S$ as the integral of $\\chi_S$ over $\\mathbb{R}^2$:\n    $$ \\operatorname{area}(S) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^2} \\chi_S(x) \\, dx $$\n    \n2.  Decompose $\\mathbb{R}^2$ into a union of disjoint unit squares translated by integer vectors. Let $C_0 = [0, 1)^2$ be the fundamental domain. Then $\\mathbb{R}^2 = \\bigcup_{u \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2} (C_0 + u)$.\n    \n3.  Using the additivity of the integral over these disjoint regions:\n    $$ \\operatorname{area}(S) = \\sum_{u \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2} \\int_{C_0 + u} \\chi_S(x) \\, dx $$\n    \n4.  Perform the change of variables $x = y + u$ where $y \\in C_0$:\n    $$ \\operatorname{area}(S) = \\sum_{u \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2} \\int_{C_0} \\chi_S(y + u) \\, dy $$\n    \n5.  By the Monotone Convergence Theorem, we can interchange the sum and the integral:\n    $$ \\operatorname{area}(S) = \\int_{C_0} \\left( \\sum_{u \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2} \\chi_S(y + u) \\right) dy $$\n    \n6.  Define the function $f(y) = \\sum_{u \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2} \\chi_S(y + u)$ for $y \\in C_0$.\n    We have $\\int_{C_0} f(y) \\, dy = \\operatorname{area}(S)$.\n    Given the hypothesis $\\operatorname{area}(S) > 1$ and $\\operatorname{area}(C_0) = 1$, it is impossible for $f(y) \\le 1$ almost everywhere. Thus, there must exist some $y_0 \\in C_0$ such that $f(y_0) > 1$.\n    \n7.  Since $f(y_0)$ represents a sum of indicator values (which are either 0 or 1), $f(y_0) > 1$ implies that $f(y_0) \\ge 2$ (or is infinite). This means there exist at least two distinct integer vectors $u_1, u_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2$ such that:\n    $$ \\chi_S(y_0 + u_1) = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\chi_S(y_0 + u_2) = 1 $$\n    \n8.  Let $p_1 = y_0 + u_1$ and $p_2 = y_0 + u_2$.

Case $\\kappa > 0$: Spherical Geometry\nThe function is $f(r) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\kappa}} \\sin(\\sqrt{\\kappa} r)$.\nWe look for $a$ such that $f(a) = 0$. The zeros of sine occur at $\\sqrt{\\kappa} a = n\\pi$. Since $f$ must be positive on $(0, a)$, we take the first zero:\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\kappa} a = \\pi \\implies a = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{\\kappa}}.\n$$\nWe verify the derivative condition at this $a$:\n$$\nf'(r) = \\cos(\\sqrt{\\kappa} r) \\implies f'(a) = \\cos(\\pi) = -1.\n$$\nThe condition is satisfied. Thus, $a = \\pi/\\sqrt{\\kappa}$.\n\n**Isometry:**\nLet $R = 1/\\sqrt{\\kappa}$. Then $f(r) = R \\sin(r/R)$ and $a = \\pi R$.\nThe metric is $g = dr^2 + R^2 \\sin^2(r/R) d\\theta^2$.\nThis is the standard metric of a sphere of radius $R$.\nWe define a map $\\Psi: M \\to S^2_R \\subset \\mathbb{R}^3$, where $S^2_R = \\{(x,y,z) \\mid x^2+y^2+z^2 = R^2\\}$, using geodesic polar coordinates:\n$$\n\\Psi(r, \\theta) = \\left( R \\sin\\left(\\frac{r}{R}\\right) \\cos\\theta, \\ R \\sin\\left(\\frac{r}{R}\\right) \\sin\\theta, \\ R \\cos\\left(\\frac{r}{R}\\right) \\right).\n$$\nAt $r=0$, $\\Psi=(0,0,R)$ (North pole). At $r=a=\\pi R$, $\\Psi=(0,0,-R)$ (South pole). The metric pullback is straightforwardly verified to be $g$. This is a global isometry.\n\n#### 2. Case $\\kappa = 0$: Euclidean Geometry\nThe function is $f(r) = r$.\nCondition $f(a)=0$: Since $r > 0$ on the domain, $f(r)$ is never zero for finite non-zero $r$.\nTherefore, $a = \\infty$.\nCondition 2 (for finite $a$) does not apply.\nThe metric is $g = dr^2 + r^2 d\\theta^2$ on $(0, \\infty) \\times S^1$.\n\n**Isometry:**\nThis is the standard polar coordinate form of the Euclidean metric.\nWe define a map $\\Psi: M \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$:\n$$\n\\Psi(r, \\theta) = (r \\cos\\theta, r \\sin\\theta).\n$$\nThis maps the coordinate singularity $r=0$ to the origin and is a global isometry between $(M, g)$ and the Euclidean plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\n#### 3. Case $\\kappa < 0$: Hyperbolic Geometry\nThe function is $f(r) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{-\\kappa}} \\sinh(\\sqrt{-\\kappa} r)$.\nCondition $f(a)=0$: Since $\\sinh(x) = 0$ only at $x=0$, and $r>0$, $f(r)$ is never zero.\nTherefore, $a = \\infty$.\nThe metric is $g = dr^2 + \\frac{1}{|\\kappa|} \\sinh^2(\\sqrt{|\\kappa|} r) d\\theta^2$.\n\n**Isometry:**\nLet $R = 1/\\sqrt{-\\kappa}$. Then $f(r) = R \\sinh(r/R)$.\nThe metric is $g = dr^2 + R^2 \\sinh^2(r/R) d\\theta^2$.\nWe identify this with the hyperboloid model of the hyperbolic plane $H^2_\\kappa$.\nLet $\\mathbb{R}^{2,1}$ be equipped with the Minkowski metric $ds^2 = -dz^2 + dx^2 + dy^2$.\nThe surface is the upper sheet of the hyperboloid: $H = \\{ (x,y,z) \\mid -z^2 + x^2 + y^2 = -R^2, z > 0 \\}$.\nWe define the map $\\Psi: M \\to H \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{2,1}$:\n$$\n\\Psi(r, \\theta) = \\left( R \\sinh\\left(\\frac{r}{R}\\right) \\cos\\theta, \\ R \\sinh\\left(\\frac{r}{R}\\right) \\sin\\theta, \\ R \\cosh\\left(\\frac{r}{R}\\right) \\right).\n$$\nVerification of the image:\n$-R^2\\cosh^2(r/R) + R^2\\sinh^2(r/R)(\\cos^2+\\sin^2) = -R^2(\\cosh^2 - \\sinh^2) = -R^2$.

In a metric space, every singleton set is closed (since the space is Hausdorff). The set $\\{\\infty\\}$ is closed in $\\alpha X$.\n    In any metric space, every closed set is a $G_\\delta$ set (a countable intersection of open sets).

A countable union of separable subspaces in a metric space implies the whole space is separable.\n    For metrizable spaces, separability is equivalent to second-countability.

The set $\\{\\infty\\}$ is closed in $\\alpha X$.\n    In any metric space, every closed set is a $G_\\delta$ set (a countable intersection of open sets). To see this, note that $\\{\\infty\\} = \\bigcap_{n=1}^\\infty B_d(\\infty, \\frac{1}{n})$, where $B_d$ denotes the open ball with respect to metric $d$.\n    \n    Let $V_n = B_d(\\infty, \\frac{1}{n})$. These are open neighborhoods of $\\infty$.\n    By the definition of the topology on $\\alpha X$, for each $n$, $V_n = \\alpha X \\setminus K_n$ for some compact set $K_n \\subseteq X$.\n    \n    We can express $X$ as:\n    $$X = \\alpha X \\setminus \\{\\infty\\} = \\alpha X \\setminus \\bigcap_{n=1}^\\infty V_n = \\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty (\\alpha X \\setminus V_n) = \\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty K_n.$$\n    Thus, $X$ is the union of countably many compact sets $K_n$. By definition, $X$ is $\\sigma$-compact.\n\n**Direction 2: $(\\Leftarrow)$ Assume $X$ is metrizable and $\\sigma$-compact.**\n\nWe established in Part 1 that $\\alpha X$ is a compact Hausdorff space. A standard result in topology (a corollary of the Urysohn Metrization Theorem) states that a **compact Hausdorff space is metrizable if and only if it is second-countable**.\n\nThus, it suffices to prove that $\\alpha X$ is second-countable.\n\n1.  **$X$ is second-countable:**\n    Since $X$ is $\\sigma$-compact, we can write $X = \\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty K_n$, where each $K_n$ is compact.\n    Since $X$ is metrizable, each subspace $K_n$ is a compact metric space.\n    Compact metric spaces are separable (and thus second-countable). A countable union of separable subspaces in a metric space implies the whole space is separable.\n    For metrizable spaces, separability is equivalent to second-countability. Therefore, $X$ has a countable basis for its topology, denote it $\\mathcal{B}_X$.\n\n2.  **Constructing a basis for $\\alpha X$:**\n    We need a countable basis for the entire space $\\alpha X$. We already have a basis $\\mathcal{B}_X$ for the points in $X$. We need a countable local basis at $\\infty$.\n    \n    Since $X$ is locally compact and $\\sigma$-compact, there exists an **exhaustion by compact sets**. That is, a sequence of compact sets $\\{C_n\\}_{n=1}^\\infty$ such that $C_n \\subseteq \\text{int}(C_{n+1})$ and $\\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty C_n = X$.\n    *(Construction sketch: Let $X = \\bigcup K_n$. Set $C_1 = K_1$. Since $C_1$ is compact and $X$ locally compact, $C_1$ has a compact neighborhood $C_2$ such that $C_1 \\subseteq \\text{int}(C_2)$ and we can ensure $K_2 \\subseteq C_2$. Inductively continue.)*\n    \n    Define $U_n = \\alpha X \\setminus C_n$. Each $U_n$ is an open neighborhood of $\\infty$ because $C_n$ is compact. The collection $\\{U_n\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ is countable.\n    \n    **Claim:** $\\{U_n\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ is a local basis at $\\infty$.\n    Let $W$ be any open set containing $\\infty$. Then $W = \\alpha X \\setminus K$ for some compact $K \\subseteq X$.\n    Since $\\{ \\text{int}(C_n) \\}$ is an open cover of $X$, it covers $K$. Since $K$ is compact, $K \\subseteq \\bigcup_{i=1}^m \\text{int}(C_{n_i}) = \\text{int}(C_N)$ for some large $N$.\n    Therefore, $K \\subseteq C_N$.\n    This implies $\\alpha X \\setminus C_N \\subseteq \\alpha X \\setminus K$, so $U_N \\subseteq W$.\n    Thus, $\\{U_n\\}$ is a local basis at $\\infty$.\n\n    **Conclusion:** The collection $\\mathcal{B}_{\\alpha X} = \\mathcal{B}_X \\cup \\{U_n : n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$ is a countable union of countable sets, hence countable. It generates the topology of $\\alpha X$.\n    \n    Since $\\alpha X$ is compact, Hausdorff, and second-countable, it is metrizable.\n\n***\n\n**Final Answer:**\n1.  **$\\alpha X$ is compact and Hausdorff** as proven in Part 1.\n2.  **$\\alpha X$ is metrizable if and only if $X$ is metrizable and $\\sigma$-compact.**\n    - If $\\alpha X$ is metrizable, $X$ is a subspace (hence metrizable) and $\\{\\infty\\}$ is a $G_\\delta$ set (implying $X$ is a countable union of compact complements, i.e., $\\sigma$-compact).\n    - If $X$ is metrizable and $\\sigma$-compact, $X$ is second-countable and admits a countable exhaustion by compact sets, which provides a countable basis for $\\alpha X$. Being compact, Hausdorff, and second-countable, $\\alpha X$ is metrizable.",

Finding the Harmonic Component $h$\n\nOn the flat torus, the space of harmonic 1-forms is spanned by the coordinate differentials $dx$ and $dy$ with constant coefficients. Thus, $h$ must be of the form:\n$$ h = c_1\\,dx + c_2\\,dy, $$\nwhere $c_1, c_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nIn the Hodge decomposition, the harmonic part $h$ corresponds to the $L^2$-projection of $\\alpha$ onto the space of harmonic forms. We determine the coefficients by integrating $\\alpha$ against the basis elements. However, since $df$ and $\\delta\\beta$ are orthogonal to harmonic forms, $c_1$ and $c_2$ are simply the average values of the coefficient functions $A(x,y)$ and $B(x,y)$ over the torus.\n\n$$ c_1 = \\int_{T^2} A(x,y)\\,\\mathrm{vol} = \\int_0^1 \\int_0^1 \\bigl(1 + \\cos(2\\pi x) + \\sin(2\\pi y)\\bigr)\\,dx\\,dy $$\nSince the integrals of $\\cos(2\\pi x)$ and $\\sin(2\\pi y)$ over a full period $[0,1]$ are 0:\n$$ c_1 = 1. $$\n\nSimilarly,\n$$ c_2 = \\int_{T^2} B(x,y)\\,\\mathrm{vol} = \\int_0^1 \\int_0^1 \\bigl(2 + \\sin(2\\pi x) + \\cos(2\\pi y)\\bigr)\\,dx\\,dy $$\n$$ c_2 = 2. $$\n\nThus, the harmonic form is:\n$$ h = 1\\,dx + 2\\,dy. $$\n\n---\n\n### 3. Finding the Exact Component $df$\n\nWe have the equation $\\alpha = df + \\delta\\beta + h$. Applying the codifferential $\\delta$ to both sides (and noting $\\delta \\delta = 0$ and $\\delta h = 0$):\n$$ \\delta \\alpha = \\delta d f = \\Delta f. $$\nWe first compute $\\delta \\alpha$:\n$$ \\delta \\alpha = -(A_x + B_y). $$\nComputing the partial derivatives:\n$$ A_x = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\bigl(1 + \\cos(2\\pi x) + \\sin(2\\pi y)\\bigr) = -2\\pi \\sin(2\\pi x), $$\n$$ B_y = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\bigl(2 + \\sin(2\\pi x) + \\cos(2\\pi y)\\bigr) = -2\\pi \\sin(2\\pi y). $$\nThus,\n$$ \\delta \\alpha = -\\bigl(-2\\pi \\sin(2\\pi x) - 2\\pi \\sin(2\\pi y)\\bigr) = 2\\pi \\sin(2\\pi x) + 2\\pi \\sin(2\\pi y). $$\nWe must solve the Poisson equation $\\Delta f = \\delta \\alpha$:\n$$ -(f_{xx} + f_{yy}) = 2\\pi \\sin(2\\pi x) + 2\\pi \\sin(2\\pi y). $$\nSince the source term is a sum of eigenfunctions of the Laplacian, we propose the ansatz:\n$$ f(x,y) = C_1 \\sin(2\\pi x) + C_2 \\sin(2\\pi y). $$\nComputing the Laplacian of the ansatz:\n$$ -f_{xx} = -C_1 \\bigl(-(2\\pi)^2 \\sin(2\\pi x)\\bigr) = 4\\pi^2 C_1 \\sin(2\\pi x), $$\n$$ -f_{yy} = -C_2 \\bigl(-(2\\pi)^2 \\sin(2\\pi y)\\bigr) = 4\\pi^2 C_2 \\sin(2\\pi y). $$\nSo,\n$$ \\Delta f = 4\\pi^2 C_1 \\sin(2\\pi x) + 4\\pi^2 C_2 \\sin(2\\pi y). $$\nMatching coefficients with $\\delta \\alpha$:\n$$ 4\\pi^2 C_1 = 2\\pi \\implies C_1 = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}, $$\n$$ 4\\pi^2 C_2 = 2\\pi \\implies C_2 = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}. $$\nThus,\n$$ f(x,y) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\sin(2\\pi x) + \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\sin(2\\pi y). $$\nThis function satisfies the condition $\\int_{T^2} f\\,\\mathrm{vol} = 0$.\n\n---\n\n### 4.

Finding the Harmonic Component $h$\n\nOn the flat torus, the space of harmonic 1-forms is spanned by the coordinate differentials $dx$ and $dy$ with constant coefficients. Thus, $h$ must be of the form:\n$$ h = c_1\\,dx + c_2\\,dy, $$\nwhere $c_1, c_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nIn the Hodge decomposition, the harmonic part $h$ corresponds to the $L^2$-projection of $\\alpha$ onto the space of harmonic forms. We determine the coefficients by integrating $\\alpha$ against the basis elements. However, since $df$ and $\\delta\\beta$ are orthogonal to harmonic forms, $c_1$ and $c_2$ are simply the average values of the coefficient functions $A(x,y)$ and $B(x,y)$ over the torus.\n\n$$ c_1 = \\int_{T^2} A(x,y)\\,\\mathrm{vol} = \\int_0^1 \\int_0^1 \\bigl(1 + \\cos(2\\pi x) + \\sin(2\\pi y)\\bigr)\\,dx\\,dy $$\nSince the integrals of $\\cos(2\\pi x)$ and $\\sin(2\\pi y)$ over a full period $[0,1]$ are 0:\n$$ c_1 = 1. $$\n\nSimilarly,\n$$ c_2 = \\int_{T^2} B(x,y)\\,\\mathrm{vol} = \\int_0^1 \\int_0^1 \\bigl(2 + \\sin(2\\pi x) + \\cos(2\\pi y)\\bigr)\\,dx\\,dy $$\n$$ c_2 = 2. $$\n\nThus, the harmonic form is:\n$$ h = 1\\,dx + 2\\,dy. $$\n\n---\n\n### 3. Finding the Exact Component $df$\n\nWe have the equation $\\alpha = df + \\delta\\beta + h$. Applying the codifferential $\\delta$ to both sides (and noting $\\delta \\delta = 0$ and $\\delta h = 0$):\n$$ \\delta \\alpha = \\delta d f = \\Delta f. $$\nWe first compute $\\delta \\alpha$:\n$$ \\delta \\alpha = -(A_x + B_y). $$\nComputing the partial derivatives:\n$$ A_x = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\bigl(1 + \\cos(2\\pi x) + \\sin(2\\pi y)\\bigr) = -2\\pi \\sin(2\\pi x), $$\n$$ B_y = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\bigl(2 + \\sin(2\\pi x) + \\cos(2\\pi y)\\bigr) = -2\\pi \\sin(2\\pi y). $$\nThus,\n$$ \\delta \\alpha = -\\bigl(-2\\pi \\sin(2\\pi x) - 2\\pi \\sin(2\\pi y)\\bigr) = 2\\pi \\sin(2\\pi x) + 2\\pi \\sin(2\\pi y). $$\nWe must solve the Poisson equation $\\Delta f = \\delta \\alpha$:\n$$ -(f_{xx} + f_{yy}) = 2\\pi \\sin(2\\pi x) + 2\\pi \\sin(2\\pi y). $$\nSince the source term is a sum of eigenfunctions of the Laplacian, we propose the ansatz:\n$$ f(x,y) = C_1 \\sin(2\\pi x) + C_2 \\sin(2\\pi y). $$\nComputing the Laplacian of the ansatz:\n$$ -f_{xx} = -C_1 \\bigl(-(2\\pi)^2 \\sin(2\\pi x)\\bigr) = 4\\pi^2 C_1 \\sin(2\\pi x), $$\n$$ -f_{yy} = -C_2 \\bigl(-(2\\pi)^2 \\sin(2\\pi y)\\bigr) = 4\\pi^2 C_2 \\sin(2\\pi y). $$\nSo,\n$$ \\Delta f = 4\\pi^2 C_1 \\sin(2\\pi x) + 4\\pi^2 C_2 \\sin(2\\pi y). $$\nMatching coefficients with $\\delta \\alpha$:\n$$ 4\\pi^2 C_1 = 2\\pi \\implies C_1 = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}, $$\n$$ 4\\pi^2 C_2 = 2\\pi \\implies C_2 = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}. $$\nThus,\n$$ f(x,y) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\sin(2\\pi x) + \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\sin(2\\pi y). $$\nThis function satisfies the condition $\\int_{T^2} f\\,\\mathrm{vol} = 0$.\n\n---\n\n### 4.

Let $m_2(x) = E_2(x) + O_2(x)$. Since the domain and boundary conditions are symmetric ($m_2(1)=0, m_2(-1)=0$), we again have $E_2(1)=0$ and $m_2(0) = E_2(0)$.\nThe even part of $m_2(x)$ is generated by integrating the even part of $m_2''(x)$ twice.\nThe even part of $m_2''(x)$ is the terms with even powers:\n$$\n\\text{Even}[m_2''](x) = \\frac{2x^4}{3} - \\frac{2x^2}{3}\n$$\nIntegrating twice:\n1. $\\text{Odd}[m_2'](x) = \\frac{2x^5}{15} - \\frac{2x^3}{9}$ (constant is 0 for odd function)\n2. $\\text{Even}[m_2](x) = \\frac{2x^6}{90} - \\frac{2x^4}{36} + K$\nSimplifying fractions:\n$$\nE_2(x) = \\frac{x^6}{45} - \\frac{x^4}{18} + K\n$$\nUsing the condition $E_2(1) = 0$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{45} - \\frac{1}{18} + K = 0\n$$\n$$\nK = \\frac{1}{18} - \\frac{1}{45} = \\frac{5}{90} - \\frac{2}{90} = \\frac{3}{90} = \\frac{1}{30}\n$$\nThus, $m_2(0) = K = \\frac{1}{30}$.\n\n**Conditional Second Moment:**\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[A^2 \\mid B_\\tau = 1] = \\frac{m_2(0)}{m_0(0)} = \\frac{1/30}{1/2} = \\frac{1}{15}\n$$\n\n### 5.

The CRLB for an unbiased estimator is:\n$$\n\\text{CRLB} = \\frac{[\\tau'(\\theta)]^2}{I(\\theta)} = \\frac{(-1/\\theta^2)^2}{n/\\theta^2} = \\frac{1/\\theta^4}{n/\\theta^2} = \\frac{1}{n\\theta^2}.\n$$\n\n**Step 2: Propose an estimator.**\nWe know that $S \\sim \\text{Gamma}(n, \\theta)$, so $E[S] = n/\\theta$.\nConsider the estimator $\\hat{\\theta}^{-1} = \\frac{S}{n} = \\bar{X}$.\nCheck for unbiasedness:\n$$\nE\\left[ \\frac{S}{n} \\right] = \\frac{1}{n} E[S] = \\frac{1}{n} \\left( \\frac{n}{\\theta} \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\theta}.\n$$\nThus, $S/n$ is an unbiased estimator of $1/\\theta$.\n\n**Step 3: Verify variance and attainment.**\nCompute the variance of $S/n$:\n$$\n\\text{Var}\\left( \\frac{S}{n} \\right) = \\frac{1}{n^2} \\text{Var}(S).\n$$\nSince $S \\sim \\text{Gamma}(n, \\theta)$, $\\text{Var}(S) = n / \\theta^2$.\n$$\n\\text{Var}\\left( \\frac{S}{n} \\right) = \\frac{1}{n^2} \\cdot \\frac{n}{\\theta^2} = \\frac{1}{n\\theta^2}.\n$$\nThe variance of $S/n$ is exactly equal to the CRLB derived above.\n\nAlternatively, the condition for an estimator $T$ to attain the CRLB is that $T$ must be a linear function of the score:\n$$\nT = \\tau(\\theta) + \\frac{\\tau'(\\theta)}{I(\\theta)} \\frac{\\partial \\ell}{\\partial \\theta}.\n$$\nSubstituting our values:\n$$\nT = \\frac{1}{\\theta} + \\frac{-1/\\theta^2}{n/\\theta^2} (n/\\theta - S) = \\frac{1}{\\theta} - \\frac{1}{n} \\left( \\frac{n}{\\theta} - S \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\theta} - \\frac{1}{\\theta} + \\frac{S}{n} = \\frac{S}{n}.\n$$\nSince the dependence on $\\theta$ cancels out, the estimator $S/n$ attains the bound uniformly.\n\n**Conclusion:** The unbiased estimator is **$\\bar{X} = S/n$**.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Exact $(1-\\alpha)$ Confidence Interval for $g(\\theta) = e^{-\\theta t}$\n\n**Step 1: Identify a pivot.**\nSince $S \\sim \\text{Gamma}(n, \\theta)$, the variable $Y = 2\\theta S$ follows a Gamma distribution with shape $n$ and rate $1/2$, which is exactly the Chi-square distribution with $2n$ degrees of freedom:\n$$\n2\\theta S \\sim \\chi^2_{2n}.\n$$\nThis quantity depends on the data $S$ and the parameter $\\theta$, but its distribution is known and independent of $\\theta$, making it a pivot.\n\n**Step 2: Construct the probability statement.**\nLet $\\chi^2_{2n, p}$ denote the quantile of the $\\chi^2_{2n}$ distribution such that $P(\\chi^2_{2n} \\le \\chi^2_{2n, p}) = p$.\nFor a $(1-\\alpha)$ confidence level, we select lower and upper quantiles $\\chi^2_{2n, \\alpha/2}$ and $\\chi^2_{2n, 1-\\alpha/2}$ (equal-tailed interval):\n$$\nP\\left( \\chi^2_{2n, \\alpha/2} \\le 2\\theta S \\le \\chi^2_{2n, 1-\\alpha/2} \\right) = 1 - \\alpha.\n$$\n\n**Step 3: Invert for $\\theta$.**\nDivide by $2S$ (since $S>0$):\n$$\n\\frac{\\chi^2_{2n, \\alpha/2}}{2S} \\le \\theta \\le \\frac{\\chi^2_{2n, 1-\\alpha/2}}{2S}.\n$$\n\n**Step 4: Transform to $g(\\theta)$.**\nWe want an interval for $g(\\theta) = e^{-\\theta t}$.

Since $A$ is symmetric positive definite (SPD), all eigenvalues are real and positive. We are given:\n$$\n0 < m \\le \\lambda_i \\le M.\n$$\nThe eigenvalues of the iteration matrix $G = I - \\alpha A$ are given by $\\mu_i = 1 - \\alpha \\lambda_i$. The spectral radius is:\n$$\n\\rho(I - \\alpha A) = \\max_{i} |1 - \\alpha \\lambda_i|.\n$$\nFor the method to converge, we require $\\rho(I - \\alpha A) < 1$, which is equivalent to requiring $|1 - \\alpha \\lambda_i| < 1$ for all eigenvalues $\\lambda_i$.

Substituting this into the iteration formula:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx^{(k+1)} &= x^{(k)} + \\alpha\\bigl(Ax_* - Ax^{(k)}\\bigr) \\\\\n&= x^{(k)} - \\alpha A\\bigl(x^{(k)} - x_*\\bigr).\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nSubtracting $x_*$ from both sides gives the recurrence for the error:\n$$\nx^{(k+1)} - x_* = x^{(k)} - x_* - \\alpha A\\bigl(x^{(k)} - x_*\\bigr),\n$$\nwhich simplifies to:\n$$\ne^{(k+1)} = (I - \\alpha A)e^{(k)}.\n$$\nBy applying this recurrence relations recursively, we have:\n$$\ne^{(k)} = (I - \\alpha A)^k e^{(0)}.\n$$\nLet $G = I - \\alpha A$ be the iteration matrix. The sequence of errors $e^{(k)}$ converges to the zero vector for every starting error $e^{(0)}$ (and thus every $x^{(0)}$) if and only if $G^k \\to 0$ as $k \\to \\infty$. A fundamental result in linear algebra states that $\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} G^k = 0$ if and only if the spectral radius $\\rho(G) < 1$.\n\n**Conclusion:** The error satisfies $e^{(k+1)} = (I - \\alpha A)e^{(k)}$, and the method converges for every starting vector $x^{(0)}$ if and only if $\\rho(I - \\alpha A) < 1$.\n\n---\n\n### 2) Range of $\\alpha$ for Convergence\n\nWe denote the eigenvalues of $A$ by $\\lambda_i$, where $i=1, \\dots, n$. Since $A$ is symmetric positive definite (SPD), all eigenvalues are real and positive. We are given:\n$$\n0 < m \\le \\lambda_i \\le M.\n$$\nThe eigenvalues of the iteration matrix $G = I - \\alpha A$ are given by $\\mu_i = 1 - \\alpha \\lambda_i$. The spectral radius is:\n$$\n\\rho(I - \\alpha A) = \\max_{i} |1 - \\alpha \\lambda_i|.\n$$\nFor the method to converge, we require $\\rho(I - \\alpha A) < 1$, which is equivalent to requiring $|1 - \\alpha \\lambda_i| < 1$ for all eigenvalues $\\lambda_i$. This leads to the compound inequality:\n$$\n-1 < 1 - \\alpha \\lambda_i < 1.\n$$\nWe analyze both inequalities separately:\n1.  **Right side:** $1 - \\alpha \\lambda_i < 1 \\implies -\\alpha \\lambda_i < 0 \\implies \\alpha \\lambda_i > 0$. Since $\\lambda_i > 0$ and we seek $\\alpha > 0$, this condition is always satisfied.\n2.  **Left side:** $1 - \\alpha \\lambda_i > -1 \\implies 2 > \\alpha \\lambda_i \\implies \\alpha < \\frac{2}{\\lambda_i}$.\n\nFor convergence to hold for *every* initial vector, this condition must hold for *all* eigenvalues. Therefore, $\\alpha$ must be less than the tightest upper bound imposed by the largest eigenvalue $\\lambda_{\\max}(A) = M$.\n$$\n\\alpha < \\frac{2}{M}.\n$$\nSince the problem states $\\alpha > 0$, we combine these conditions.\n\n**Conclusion:** The set of all $\\alpha > 0$ for which the iteration converges is:\n$$\n\\alpha \\in \\left(0, \\frac{2}{M}\\right).\n$$\n\n---\n\n### 3) Optimal $\\alpha$ and Minimal Spectral Radius\n\nWe seek to minimize the function $\\rho(\\alpha) = \\max_{\\lambda \\in [m, M]} |1 - \\alpha \\lambda|$.\nSince $f(\\lambda) = 1 - \\alpha \\lambda$ is monotonic, the maximum absolute value occurs at one of the endpoints of the spectrum, $m$ or $M$. Thus:\n$$\n\\rho(\\alpha) = \\max \\bigl( |1 - \\alpha m|, |1 - \\alpha M| \\bigr).\n$$\nAssuming we are in the convergence range $0 < \\alpha < \\frac{2}{M}$, we have $1 - \\alpha m > 0$ (since $\\alpha < 2/M \\le 2/m$) and $1 - \\alpha M < 1$.\nSpecifically, as $\\alpha$ increases from $0$:\n- The term $1 - \\alpha m$ decreases from $1$.\n- The term $1 - \\alpha M$ decreases from $1$, eventually becoming negative.\n- The term $|1 - \\alpha M|$ eventually increases as $\\alpha$ grows large.\n\nThe minimum of the maximum of these two functions occurs when they are equal in absolute value but opposite in sign (since $m < M$, $1 - \\alpha m$ is the positive branch and $1 - \\alpha M$ is the negative branch).\n$$\n1 - \\alpha m = -(1 - \\alpha M) = \\alpha M - 1.\n$$\nSolving for $\\alpha$:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n1 - \\alpha m &= \\alpha M - 1 \\\\\n2 &= \\alpha(M + m) \\\\\n\\alpha_{\\mathrm{opt}} &= \\frac{2}{M + m}.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nWe substitute $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{opt}}$ back into the expression for the spectral radius to find $\\rho_{\\min}$:\n$$\n\\rho_{\\min} = 1 - \\alpha_{\\mathrm{opt}} m = 1 - \\frac{2m}{M + m} = \\frac{M + m - 2m}{M + m} = \\frac{M - m}{M + m}.\n$$\n(Checking the other term: $|1 - \\alpha_{\\mathrm{opt}} M| = |1 - \\frac{2M}{M+m}| = |\\frac{m-M}{M+m}| = \\frac{M-m}{M+m}$).\n\nFinally, we express $\\rho_{\\min}$ in terms of the condition number $\\kappa = M/m$:\n$$\n\\rho_{\\min} = \\frac{M - m}{M + m} = \\frac{m(\\kappa - 1)}{m(\\kappa + 1)} = \\frac{\\kappa - 1}{\\kappa + 1}.\n$$\n\n**Conclusion:**\n$$\n\\alpha_{\\mathrm{opt}} = \\frac{2}{M + m}, \\qquad \\rho_{\\min} = \\frac{\\kappa - 1}{\\kappa + 1}.\n$$\n\n---\n\n### 4) Convergence in the $A$-norm\n\nWe define the $A$-norm by $\\|v\\|_A = \\sqrt{v^{\\mathsf T} A v} = \\|A^{1/2}v\\|_2$, where $A^{1/2}$ is the unique symmetric positive definite square root of $A$.\n\nWe wish to prove $\\|e^{(k)}\\|_A \\le \\rho_{\\min}^k \\|e^{(0)}\\|_A$ assuming $\\alpha = \\alpha_{\\mathrm{opt}}$.\n\nUsing the error recurrence $e^{(k)} = (I - \\alpha A)^k e^{(0)}$, we expand the definition of the $A$-norm for $e^{(k)}$:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\|e^{(k)}\\|_A &= \\|A^{1/2} e^{(k)}\\|_2 \\\\\n&= \\|A^{1/2} (I - \\alpha A)^k e^{(0)}\\|_2.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nSince $I - \\alpha A$ is a polynomial in $A$, it commutes with any function of $A$, including $A^{1/2}$. Therefore, $A^{1/2}(I - \\alpha A)^k = (I - \\alpha A)^k A^{1/2}$.\n$$\n\\|e^{(k)}\\|_A = \\|(I - \\alpha A)^k \\left( A^{1/2} e^{(0)} \\right)\\|_2.\n$$\nLet $y = A^{1/2} e^{(0)}$. Note that $\\|y\\|_2 = \\|e^{(0)}\\|_A$. The inequality becomes:\n$$\n\\|(I - \\alpha A)^k y\\|_2 \\le \\rho_{\\min}^k \\|y\\|_2.\n$$\nLet $G = I - \\alpha_{\\mathrm{opt}} A$. Since $A$ is symmetric, $G$ is also symmetric. For any real symmetric matrix, the induced Euclidean norm (spectral norm) is equal to its spectral radius:\n$$\n\\|G\\|_2 = \\rho(G).\n$$\nIn part 3, we established that $\\rho(G) = \\rho_{\\min}$.

The map $\\phi: A \\to k \\times k$ defined by $\\phi\\left(\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 0 & c \\end{pmatrix}\\right) = (a, c)$ is a surjective algebra homomorphism with kernel $N$.

Classification of Two-Sided Ideals\n\nWe utilize the correspondence between ideals of $A$ and ideals of the quotient $A/J(A) \\cong k \\times k$.\n\n**Claim:** Every non-zero two-sided ideal $I$ of $A$ contains $J(A)$.\n*Proof:* Let $I$ be a non-zero ideal. If $I \\cap J(A) \\neq \\{0\\}$, then since $J(A)$ is a 1-dimensional vector space, $I$ must contain all of $J(A)$.\nSuppose for contradiction that $I \\cap J(A) = \\{0\\}$. Let $X = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 0 & c \\end{pmatrix} \\in I$.\nMultiplying by the standard basis matrix $E_{12} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\in A$:\n$$ X E_{12} = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 0 & c \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & a \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\in I. $$\n$$ E_{12} X = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 0 & c \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & c \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\in I. $$\nBoth resulting matrices are in $J(A)$. Since $I \\cap J(A) = \\{0\\}$, we must have $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & a \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = 0 \\implies a=0$, and $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & c \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = 0 \\implies c=0$.
