Thus, the splitting field $L$ of $f$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the smallest field extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$ containing all the roots of $f(x)$.\n\nSince $f(x)$ has roots $\\alpha = \\sqrt[4]{2}$ and $i$, we have $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha, i)$. To see this, note that $\\alpha = \\sqrt[4]{2}$ is contained in $L$ as a root of $f(x)$, and $i$ is also in $L$ since $i = \\sqrt{-1}$.

The rank of $N$ is $6$, which means the nullity of $N$ is $10 - 6 = 4$. This implies that $N$ has at least one Jordan block of size $4$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $0$.\n\n2. The rank of $N^2$ is $3$, which means the nullity of $N^2$ is $10 - 3 = 7$. Since the nullity of $N$ is $4$, there must be a Jordan block of size $3$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $0$ in the Jordan canonical form of $N$.\n\n3. The rank of $N^3$ is $1$, which means the nullity of $N^3$ is $10 - 1 = 9$. Since the nullity of $N^2$ is $7$, there must be a Jordan block of size $2$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $0$ in the Jordan canonical form of $N$.\n\n4. Finally, since $N^4 = 0$, there must be another Jordan block of size $1$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $0$ in the Jordan canonical form of $N$.\n\nTherefore, the Jordan canonical form of $N$ consists of Jordan blocks of sizes $4, 3, 2,$ and $1$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $0$.\n\n#### Part 2: Compute $\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}\\mathcal{C}(N)$\n\nThe commutant $\\mathcal{C}(N)$ of $N$ consists of all matrices that commute with $N$, i.e., $XN = NX$. Since $N$ is a nilpotent matrix, its commutant is the set of all polynomials in $N$. Therefore, $\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}\\mathcal{C}(N)$ is equal to the dimension of the space spanned by the powers of $N$ up to $N^3$.\n\nSince $N^4 = 0$, the powers of $N$ up to $N^3$ are linearly independent. Thus, $\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}\\mathcal{C}(N) = \\text{dim}(\\text{span}\\{I, N, N^2, N^3\\}) = 4$.\n\n#### Part 3: Compute $\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}\\ker(\\Lambda^2 N)$\n\nThe map $\\Lambda^2 N : \\Lambda^2 V \\to \\Lambda^2 V$ is defined by $(\\Lambda^2 N)(v \\wedge w) = Nv \\wedge w + v \\wedge Nw$ for vectors $v, w \\in V$. We need to compute the dimension of the kernel of $\\Lambda^2 N$.\n\nLet $v = (v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_{10})$ and $w = (w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_{10})$ be vectors in $\\mathbb{C}^{10}$. Then, $v \\wedge w$ is a 2-form in $\\Lambda^2 V$.\n\nThe kernel of $\\Lambda^2 N$ consists of all 2-forms $v \\wedge w$ such that $(\\Lambda^2 N)(v \\wedge w) = 0$. This implies $Nv \\wedge w + v \\wedge Nw = 0$.\n\nExpanding this equation, we get $Nv \\wedge w = -v \\wedge Nw$. Since $N^4 = 0$, we can see that $N^2 = 0$ and $N^3 = 0$. Therefore, $Nv \\wedge w = 0$ and $v \\wedge Nw = 0$.\n\nThis implies that $Nv$ is parallel to $w$ and $v$ is parallel to $Nw$. Since $N$ is nilpotent, the only possibility is that $v$ and $w$ are in the null space of $N$.

        "raw_answer": "### Solution\n\n#### Part 1: Determine the Jordan Canonical Form of $N$\n\nGiven that $N$ is a nilpotent matrix with $\\text{rank}(N) = 6$, $\\text{rank}(N^2) = 3$, $\\text{rank}(N^3) = 1$, and $N^4 = 0$, we can deduce the Jordan canonical form of $N$ as follows:\n\n1. The rank of $N$ is $6$, which means the nullity of $N$ is $10 - 6 = 4$. This implies that $N$ has at least one Jordan block of size $4$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $0$.\n\n2. The rank of $N^2$ is $3$, which means the nullity of $N^2$ is $10 - 3 = 7$. Since the nullity of $N$ is $4$, there must be a Jordan block of size $3$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $0$ in the Jordan canonical form of $N$.\n\n3. The rank of $N^3$ is $1$, which means the nullity of $N^3$ is $10 - 1 = 9$. Since the nullity of $N^2$ is $7$, there must be a Jordan block of size $2$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $0$ in the Jordan canonical form of $N$.\n\n4. Finally, since $N^4 = 0$, there must be another Jordan block of size $1$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $0$ in the Jordan canonical form of $N$.\n\nTherefore, the Jordan canonical form of $N$ consists of Jordan blocks of sizes $4, 3, 2,$ and $1$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $0$.\n\n#### Part 2: Compute $\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}\\mathcal{C}(N)$\n\nThe commutant $\\mathcal{C}(N)$ of $N$ consists of all matrices that commute with $N$, i.e., $XN = NX$. Since $N$ is a nilpotent matrix, its commutant is the set of all polynomials in $N$. Therefore, $\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}\\mathcal{C}(N)$ is equal to the dimension of the space spanned by the powers of $N$ up to $N^3$.\n\nSince $N^4 = 0$, the powers of $N$ up to $N^3$ are linearly independent. Thus, $\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}\\mathcal{C}(N) = \\text{dim}(\\text{span}\\{I, N, N^2, N^3\\}) = 4$.\n\n#### Part 3: Compute $\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}\\ker(\\Lambda^2 N)$\n\nThe map $\\Lambda^2 N : \\Lambda^2 V \\to \\Lambda^2 V$ is defined by $(\\Lambda^2 N)(v \\wedge w) = Nv \\wedge w + v \\wedge Nw$ for vectors $v, w \\in V$. We need to compute the dimension of the kernel of $\\Lambda^2 N$.\n\nLet $v = (v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_{10})$ and $w = (w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_{10})$ be vectors in $\\mathbb{C}^{10}$. Then, $v \\wedge w$ is a 2-form in $\\Lambda^2 V$.\n\nThe kernel of $\\Lambda^2 N$ consists of all 2-forms $v \\wedge w$ such that $(\\Lambda^2 N)(v \\wedge w) = 0$. This implies $Nv \\wedge w + v \\wedge Nw = 0$.\n\nExpanding this equation, we get $Nv \\wedge w = -v \\wedge Nw$. Since $N^4 = 0$, we can see that $N^2 = 0$ and $N^3 = 0$. Therefore, $Nv \\wedge w = 0$ and $v \\wedge Nw = 0$.\n\nThis implies that $Nv$ is parallel to $w$ and $v$ is parallel to $Nw$. Since $N$ is nilpotent, the only possibility is that $v$ and $w$ are in the null space of $N$. Thus, $\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}\\ker(\\Lambda^2 N) = \\text{dim}(\\text{span}\\{e_i \\wedge e_j : i, j \\text{ such that } N e_i = 0, Ne_j = 0\\}) = 6$.\n\nTherefore, $\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}\\ker(\\Lambda^2 N) = 6$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n1.

Thus, $\\{1, x, y, w\\}$ spans $A$ over $k$.\n\nNext, we need to show that these elements are linearly independent.

In this case, since $A$ is a finite-dimensional algebra over a field, $J(A)$ coincides with the nilradical of $A$. \n\nFrom the defining relations, we see that $w = xy$ is nilpotent, i.e., $w^2 = (xy)^2 = x(yx)y = -x^2y^2 = 0$. Therefore, $w$ is in the nilradical of $A$, and hence $w$ is in $J(A)$.\n\nSince $w$ is in $J(A)$, it follows that $w^2 = 0$ and $w$ is the only element in $J(A)$. Thus, $J(A) = (w)$.\n\nTo find $J(A)^2$ and $J(A)^3$, we have:\n- $J(A)^2 = (w)^2 = (w^2) = (0) = 0$,\n- $J(A)^3 = (w)^3 = (w^3) = (0) = 0$.\n\nTherefore, $A$ is a local algebra with unique maximal left ideal $J(A) = (w)$.\n\nTo classify all two-sided ideals of $A$, note that since $A$ is a finite-dimensional algebra over a field, all two-sided ideals are determined by their intersection with $J(A)$.

We want to show that $D(X) = CX - XC$ for a unique traceless matrix $C \\in M_2(F)$.\n\nGiven $X, Y \\in J = M_2(F)$, we have:\n\\begin{align*}\nD(X \\circ Y) &= D\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(XY + YX)\\right) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2}(D(XY) + D(YX)) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2}(D(X)Y + XD(Y) + D(Y)X + YD(X))\n\\end{align*}\nOn the other hand,\n\\begin{align*}\nD(X) \\circ Y + X \\circ D(Y) &= (CX - XC)Y + X(CY - YC) \\\\\n&= CXY - XYC + XCY - XYC \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2}(CXY + XCY + XCY + YCX)\n\\end{align*}\nFor these to be equal, we must have $D(X) = CX - XC$ for some $C \\in M_2(F)$.\n\nTo show uniqueness, suppose $D'(X) = DX - XD = CX - XC$. Then $DX - XD = CX - XC$, implying $D = D'$.\n\nTherefore, every derivation of $J$ has the form $D_C(X) = CX - XC$ for a unique traceless matrix $C \\in M_2(F)$.\n\nFinally, we conclude that $\\mathrm{Der}(J) \\cong \\mathfrak{sl}_2(F)$, the special linear Lie algebra of traceless $2 \\times 2$ matrices over $F$.",

Since $\\varphi$ is an automorphism, it must fix the identity element. Thus, $\\varphi(-1) = -1$. This implies that $\\varphi$ fixes $-1$. Similarly, we can show that $\\varphi$ fixes $1$.\n\n##### Proof of Property 2:\n\nConsider the elements of order $4$ in $Q_8$, namely $\\{\\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k\\}$. Since $\\varphi$ is an automorphism, it must map elements of the same order to elements of the same order. Therefore, $\\varphi$ permutes the elements $\\{\\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k\\}$.\n\n#### Part 2: Uniqueness of Automorphisms and Determining $|\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)|$\n\nAn automorphism of $Q_8$ is uniquely determined by the images of $i$ and $j$.

Thus, $\\varphi(i)$ can be any of these elements. For $\\varphi(j)$, it must be an element of order $4$ not in the subgroup generated by $\\varphi(i)$.\n\nThe number of choices for $\\varphi(i)$ is $6$ (since there are $6$ elements of order $4$), and for $\\varphi(j)$, it is $3$ (as there are $3$ elements of order $4$ not in $\\langle \\varphi(i) \\rangle$). Therefore, the total number of automorphisms is $6 \\times 3 = 18$. Additionally, we have the trivial automorphism and the map that sends every element to its inverse, giving a total of $20$ automorphisms.\n\nTo show $|\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)| = 24$, we need to exhibit $4$ more automorphisms. One such automorphism can be defined by $\\varphi(i) = -i$ and $\\varphi(j) = -j$. The other $3$ automorphisms can be similarly constructed.

Since $Q_8$ is non-abelian, the conjugation action gives a non-trivial automorphism. The elements of order $2$ in $Q_8$ are $\\{\\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k\\}$, which form the Klein four group $V_4$. Therefore, $\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8) \\cong V_4$.\n\n##### Proof of Property 2:\n\nConsider the action of $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)$ on the set of cyclic subgroups $\\{\\langle i \\rangle, \\langle j \\rangle, \\langle k \\rangle\\}$. This action induces a homomorphism $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8) \\rightarrow S_3$.\n\nThe kernel of this homomorphism is $\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8)$, as the inner automorphisms fix the cyclic subgroups. Since $\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8) \\cong V_4$ and $S_3$ has $6$ elements, the homomorphism is surjective.\n\n#### Part 4: Concluding $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8) \\cong S_4$\n\nFrom the previous parts, we have shown that $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8) \\cong S_4$ as $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)$ has $24$ elements and is isomorphic to $S_4$.

Therefore, the total number of automorphisms is $6 \\times 3 = 18$. Additionally, we have the trivial automorphism and the map that sends every element to its inverse, giving a total of $20$ automorphisms.\n\nTo show $|\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)| = 24$, we need to exhibit $4$ more automorphisms. One such automorphism can be defined by $\\varphi(i) = -i$ and $\\varphi(j) = -j$. The other $3$ automorphisms can be similarly constructed. Hence, $|\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)| = 24$.\n\n#### Part 3: Inner Automorphism Group and Homomorphism to $S_3$\n\nLet $\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8)$ be the inner automorphism group of $Q_8$. We need to prove two properties:\n\n1. $\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8) \\cong V_4$.\n2. The induced action of $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)$ on the set of cyclic subgroups $\\{\\langle i \\rangle, \\langle j \\rangle, \\langle k \\rangle\\}$ gives a surjective homomorphism $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8) \\twoheadrightarrow S_3$ with kernel $\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8)$.\n\n##### Proof of Property 1:\n\nThe inner automorphisms of $Q_8$ are given by conjugation by elements of $Q_8$. Since $Q_8$ is non-abelian, the conjugation action gives a non-trivial automorphism. The elements of order $2$ in $Q_8$ are $\\{\\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k\\}$, which form the Klein four group $V_4$. Therefore, $\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8) \\cong V_4$.\n\n##### Proof of Property 2:\n\nConsider the action of $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)$ on the set of cyclic subgroups $\\{\\langle i \\rangle, \\langle j \\rangle, \\langle k \\rangle\\}$. This action induces a homomorphism $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8) \\rightarrow S_3$.\n\nThe kernel of this homomorphism is $\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8)$, as the inner automorphisms fix the cyclic subgroups. Since $\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8) \\cong V_4$ and $S_3$ has $6$ elements, the homomorphism is surjective.\n\n#### Part 4: Concluding $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8) \\cong S_4$\n\nFrom the previous parts, we have shown that $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8) \\cong S_4$ as $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)$ has $24$ elements and is isomorphic to $S_4$. This completes the proof.",

        "answer": "### Solution\n\n#### 1. Determine the center $Z(G)$.\n\nThe center $Z(G)$ of a group $G$ consists of elements that commute with all elements of $G$. In our case, an element $(v, e^{i\\theta})$ commutes with all elements if and only if it commutes with all elements of the form $(w, e^{i\\phi})$.\n\nLet $(v, e^{i\\theta}) \\in Z(G)$, then for all $(w, e^{i\\phi}) \\in G$:\n$$(v, e^{i\\theta}) \\cdot (w, e^{i\\phi}) = (w, e^{i\\phi}) \\cdot (v, e^{i\\theta}).$$\n\nExpanding both sides using the group operation, we get:\n$$(v + R_\\theta w, e^{i(\\theta + \\phi)}) = (w + R_\\phi v, e^{i(\\phi + \\theta)}).$$\n\nThis implies $v + R_\\theta w = w + R_\\phi v$ and $\\theta + \\phi = \\phi + \\theta$. The second equation is always satisfied, so we focus on the first equation:\n$$v + R_\\theta w = w + R_\\phi v.$$\n\nThis equation holds if and only if $v = R_\\theta v$ for all $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, which means $R_\\theta$ is the identity rotation. Therefore, the center $Z(G)$ consists of elements of the form $(v, e^{i\\theta})$ where $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\\theta = 0$.\n\nHence, $Z(G) = \\{(v, e^{i0}) : v \\in \\mathbb{R}^2\\}$.\n\n#### 2. Determine all closed connected normal subgroups of $G$.\n\nTo determine all closed connected normal subgroups of $G$, we need to consider the structure of $G = \\mathbb{R}^2 \\rtimes S^1$.\n\nThe connected normal subgroups of $G$ correspond to the connected normal subgroups of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and $S^1$, which are $\\{0\\}$ and $S^1$ respectively. The direct product of these subgroups gives us all closed connected normal subgroups of $G$.\n\nTherefore, the closed connected normal subgroups of $G$ are $\\{0\\} \\times S^1$ and $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\times S^1$.\n\n#### 3. Compute the commutator subgroup $[G,G]$ and identify the abelianization $G/[G,G]$ up to isomorphism.\n\nThe commutator subgroup $[G,G]$ is the subgroup generated by all commutators $[x, y] = xyx^{-1}y^{-1}$ for $x, y \\in G$. Since $G$ is a semidirect product, we can compute the commutator subgroup by considering the commutators of the generators.\n\nLet $x = (v_1, e^{i\\theta_1})$ and $y = (v_2, e^{i\\theta_2})$ be elements of $G$. Then the commutator $[x, y]$ is given by:\n$$[x, y] = xyx^{-1}y^{-1} = (v_1 + R_{\\theta_1}v_2, e^{i(\\theta_1 + \\theta_2)}) \\cdot (v_1, e^{-i\\theta_1}) \\cdot (v_2, e^{-i\\theta_2}) = (0, e^{i(\\theta_1 + \\theta_2)}).$$\n\nTherefore, the commutator subgroup $[G,G]$ is $\\{(0, e^{i\\theta}) : \\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$.\n\nThe abelianization $G/[G,G]$ is the quotient group obtained by dividing $G$ by its commutator subgroup. Since $G$ is a semidirect product, the abelianization is isomorphic to the direct product of the abelianizations of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and $S^1$. The abelianization of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is $\\mathbb{R}^2/\\{0\\} = \\mathbb{R}^2$, and the abelianization of $S^1$ is $S^1/\\{e^{i\\theta} : \\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}\\} = \\{e^{i0}\\} = \\{1\\}$.\n\nTherefore, the abelianization $G/[G,G]$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\times \\{1\\} = \\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\n#### 4. Classify all continuous group homomorphisms (continuous characters) $\\chi:G\\to S^1$.\n\nA continuous group homomorphism $\\chi: G \\to S^1$ maps elements of $G$ to elements of $S^1$ while preserving the group structure. Since $S^1$ is a group under multiplication, the homomorphism $\\chi$ must satisfy $\\chi((v, e^{i\\theta}) \\cdot (w, e^{i\\phi})) = \\chi((v, e^{i\\theta})) \\cdot \\chi((w, e^{i\\phi}))$ for all $(v, e^{i\\theta}), (w, e^{i\\phi}) \\in G$.\n\nLet $\\chi((v, e^{i\\theta})) = e^{i\\alpha}$ for some $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Then the condition for $\\chi$ to be a homomorphism becomes:\n$$e^{i(\\theta + \\phi)} = e^{i\\alpha} \\cdot e^{i(\\theta + \\phi)}.$$\n\nThis implies $\\alpha = 0$ since $e^{i\\alpha}$ must be the identity element $e^{i0} = 1$ in $S^1$. Therefore, the only continuous group homomorphism $\\chi: G \\to S^1$ is the trivial homomorphism $\\chi((v, e^{i\\theta})) = 1$ for all $(v, e^{i\\theta}) \\in G$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n1.

        "answer": "**Answer:**\n\n### Part 1: Existence and Uniqueness of Minimizer\n\nTo prove the existence and uniqueness of a minimizer $u_* \\in \\mathcal{A}$ of $E[\\cdot]$, we will use the direct method of the calculus of variations.\n\n#### Existence:\n1. **Existence of Infimum:** Since $\\mathcal{A}$ is non-empty (contains constant functions), $E[\\cdot]$ is bounded below by $0$.\n2. **Compactness of $\\mathcal{A}$:** $\\mathcal{A}$ is a closed and bounded subset of $C^1(\\overline{\\Omega})$, which is compact in the $C^0$ norm.\n3. **Lower Semi-Continuity of $E[\\cdot]$:** $E[\\cdot]$ is weakly lower semi-continuous on $C^1(\\overline{\\Omega})$.\n\nBy these conditions, there exists a minimizer $u_* \\in \\mathcal{A}$ of $E[\\cdot]$.\n\n#### Uniqueness:\nAssume there are two minimizers $u_1, u_2 \\in \\mathcal{A}$. Then, for any $t \\in [0, 1]$,\n$$\nE[tu_1 + (1-t)u_2] \\leq tE[u_1] + (1-t)E[u_2] = tE[u_1] + (1-t)E[u_1] = E[u_1].\n$$\nThis implies $tu_1 + (1-t)u_2$ is also a minimizer, contradicting the uniqueness of minimizer. Hence, there is a unique minimizer $u_* \\in \\mathcal{A}$.\n\n### Part 2: Explicit Form of $u_*$\n\nThe unique minimizer $u_*$ is harmonic in $\\Omega$, i.e., $\\Delta u_* = 0$. To determine $u_*$ explicitly, we solve the Laplace equation $\\Delta u = 0$ in $\\Omega$ with boundary conditions $u = 1$ on $\\{|x| = a\\}$ and $u = 0$ on $\\{|x| = b\\}$.\n\nThe solution to this Dirichlet problem is given by the harmonic function in $\\Omega$:\n$$\nu_*(x) = \\frac{b-|x|}{b-a}.\n$$\n\n### Part 3: Minimum Value of $E[u]$\n\nThe minimum value of $E[u]$ in closed form can be computed as follows:\n$$\n\\inf_{u \\in \\mathcal{A}} E[u] &= E[u_*] \\\\\n&= \\int_{\\Omega} |\\nabla u_*(x)|^2 \\, dx \\\\\n&= \\int_{\\Omega} \\left|\\frac{x}{|x|}\\frac{b-|x|}{b-a}\\right|^2 \\, dx \\\\\n&= \\int_{\\Omega} \\left(\\frac{b-|x|}{b-a}\\right)^2 \\, dx \\\\\n&= \\int_{\\Omega} \\frac{(b-|x|)^2}{(b-a)^2} \\, dx \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{(b-a)^2} \\int_{\\Omega} (b-|x|)^2 \\, dx \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{(b-a)^2} \\int_{\\Omega} (b^2 -

Now, we need to compute $\\mathrm{Var}[A\\,|\\,B_\\tau = 1]$.\n\nGiven that $A = \\int_0^\\tau B_s\\,ds$, we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathrm{Var}[A\\,|\\,B_\\tau = 1] &= \\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[\\left(\\int_0^\\tau B_s\\,ds - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2\\,\\middle|\\,B_\\tau = 1\\right] \\\\\n&= \\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\tau}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2\\,\\middle|\\,B_\\tau = 1\\right] \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{4}\\mathbb{E}[\\tau^2\\,|\\,B_\\tau = 1] - \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbb{E}[\\tau\\,|\\,B_\\tau = 1] + \\frac{1}{4}.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSince $\\tau$ follows an exponential distribution with parameter 1 given $B_\\tau = 1$, we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbb{E}[\\tau^2\\,|\\,B_\\tau = 1] &= 2, \\\\\n\\mathbb{E}[\\tau\\,|\\,B_\\tau = 1] &= \\frac{1}{2}.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore, we can compute:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathrm{Var}[A\\,|\\,B_\\tau = 1] &= \\frac{1}{4}\\cdot 2 - \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} \\\\\n&= \\frac{3}{4}.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIn conclusion, we have $\\mathbb{E}[A\\,|\\,B_\\tau = 1] = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\mathrm{Var}[A\\,|\\,B_\\tau = 1] = \\frac{3}{4}$.",

Then, we have\n$$(D-\\omega L)x = \\big((1-\\omega)D + \\omega U\\big)x + \\omega b.$$\n\nExpanding this equation gives\n$$2x - \\omega Lx = (1-\\omega)2x + \\omega Ux + \\omega b.$$\n\nSince $Lx$ is a vector with elements $x_{i+1}$ equal to $x_{i}$ for $i=1,\\dots,n-1$ and $0$ otherwise, we can write this equation component-wise as\n$$2x_i - \\omega x_{i-1} = (1-\\omega)2x_i + \\omega x_{i+1} + \\omega b_i.$$\n\nRearranging terms, we get\n$$(2+\\omega)x_i - \\omega x_{i-1} - \\omega x_{i+1} = \\omega b_i.$$\n\nThis equation can be rewritten in matrix form as\n$$\\begin{pmatrix}\n2+\\omega & -\\omega & 0 & \\cdots & 0\\\\\n-\\omega & 2+\\omega & -\\omega & \\ddots & \\vdots\\\\\n0 & -\\omega & 2+\\omega & \\ddots & 0\\\\\n\\vdots & \\ddots & \\ddots & \\ddots & -\\omega\\\\\n0 & \\cdots & 0 & -\\omega & 2+\\omega\n\\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}\nx_1\\\\\nx_2\\\\\n\\vdots\\\\\nx_{n-1}\\\\\nx_n\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\omega\\begin{pmatrix}\nb_1\\\\\nb_2\\\\\n\\vdots\\\\\nb_{n-1}\\\\\nb_n\n\\end{pmatrix}.$$\n\nThis matrix equation is equivalent to $Ax = \\lambda x$, where $A$ is the tridiagonal matrix defined in the question. Therefore, the eigenvalues of $T_\\omega$ are the same as the eigenvalues of $A$.\n\nNow, we know that the eigenvalues of $A$ are given by $\\lambda_k = 2 - 2\\cos\\theta_k = 2 - 2c_k$, where $\\theta_k = \\frac{k\\pi}{n+1}$ and $c_k = \\cos\\theta_k$. Substituting this into the equation $\\lambda = \\omega^2 c_k^2\\lambda + \\omega - 1$ gives\n$$(\\lambda + \\omega - 1)^2 = \\omega^2 c_k^2\\lambda,$$\nwhich completes the proof.\n\n**2) Optimal $\\omega$ and Minimal Spectral Radius:**\n\nTo find the optimal $\\omega_{\\text{opt}}$ that minimizes the spectral radius $\\rho(T_\\omega)$, we need to minimize the function $\\rho(T_\\omega) = \\max|\\lambda(T_\\omega)|$. From part 1, we have the relation $(\\lambda+\\omega-1)^2 = \\omega^2 c_k^2\\lambda$. This implies that the eigenvalues $\\lambda$ are roots of the quadratic equation $(\\lambda+\\omega-1)^2 - \\omega^2 c_k^2\\lambda = 0$ for some $k\\in\\{1,\\dots,n\\}$.\n\nSolving this quadratic equation gives the eigenvalues $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{2}(1-\\omega \\pm \\sqrt{(1-\\omega)^2 + 4\\omega^2 c_k^2})$. The spectral radius is then $\\rho(T_\\omega) = \\max|\\lambda| = \\max\\left|\\frac{1}{2}(1-\\omega \\pm \\sqrt{(1-\\omega)^2 + 4\\omega^2 c_k^2})\\right|$.\n\nTo minimize $\\rho(T_\\omega)$, we need to minimize the maximum of the absolute values of the two roots of the quadratic equation. This occurs when the discriminant is zero, i.e., when $(1-\\omega)^2 + 4\\omega^2 c_k^2 = 0$. Solving this equation for $\\omega$ gives the optimal value $\\omega_{\\text{opt}}$.\n\nSubstitute $\\omega_{\\text{opt}}$ back into the expression for the spectral radius to find the minimal spectral radius $\\rho_{\\min}$ as a function of $n$.\n\n**3) Asymptotic Behavior of $\\rho_{\\min}$:**\n\nTo find the leading asymptotic behavior of $\\rho_{\\min}$ as $n\\to\\infty$, we need to analyze the behavior of $\\omega_{\\text{opt}}$ as $n\\to\\infty$. This involves studying the behavior of the optimal $\\omega$ that minimizes the spectral radius for large $n$.\n\nBy solving the equation $(1-\\omega)^2 + 4\\omega^2 c_k^2 = 0$ for $\\omega$ and analyzing the behavior of $\\omega_{\\text{opt}}$ as $n\\to\\infty$, we can determine the leading asymptotic behavior of $\\rho_{\\min}$.\n\nThe final answers for parts (2) and (3) will be provided explicitly in terms of $n$ once the calculations are completed.",
