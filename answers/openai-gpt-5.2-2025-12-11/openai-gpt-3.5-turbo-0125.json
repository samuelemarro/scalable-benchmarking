The rank of $N^2$ is $3$, which means the nullity of $N^2$ is $10 - 3 = 7$. Since $N^4 = 0$, the Jordan blocks corresponding to the eigenvalue $0$ in $N$ must have sizes $4, 3$.\n\n3.

Thus, $\\{1, x, y, w\\}$ spans $A$ over $k$.\n\nNext, we need to show that these elements are linearly independent. Suppose we have a $k$-linear combination of $1, x, y, w$ that equals zero:\n$$\na\\cdot 1 + b\\cdot x + c\\cdot y + d\\cdot w = 0,\n$$\nwhere $a, b, c, d \\in k$.

In this case, since $A$ is a finite-dimensional algebra over a field, $J(A)$ coincides with the nilradical of $A$. \n\nFrom the defining relations, we see that $w = xy$ is nilpotent, i.e., $w^2 = (xy)^2 = x(yx)y = -x^2y^2 = 0$.

        "answer": "### Solution\n\n#### Part 1: Proving Properties of Automorphisms in $Q_8$\n\nLet $\\varphi \\in \\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)$ be an automorphism of $Q_8$. We need to prove two properties:\n\n1. $\\varphi$ fixes $\\pm 1$.\n2. $\\varphi$ permutes the elements $\\{\\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k\\}$.\n\n##### Property 1: Fixing $\\pm 1$\n\nConsider the element $-1 \\in Q_8$. Since $-1 = i^2 = j^2 = k^2$, we have $\\varphi(-1) = \\varphi(i)^2 = \\varphi(j)^2 = \\varphi(k)^2$. But $\\varphi(-1) = -1$ since $\\varphi$ is an automorphism. Therefore, $\\varphi(i)^2 = \\varphi(j)^2 = \\varphi(k)^2 = -1$. This implies that $\\varphi(i), \\varphi(j), \\varphi(k)$ are all elements of order $4$ in $Q_8$. Since $-1$ is the only element of order $2$ in $Q_8$, we conclude that $\\varphi(-1) = -1$, i.e., $\\varphi$ fixes $\\pm 1$.\n\n##### Property 2: Permuting Elements of Order $4$\n\nTo show that $\\varphi$ permutes the elements $\\{\\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k\\}$, we note that these elements are the generators of the cyclic subgroups of order $4$ in $Q_8$. Since $\\varphi$ is an automorphism, it must map generators to generators. Therefore, $\\varphi$ permutes the elements $\\{\\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k\\}$.\n\n#### Part 2: Uniqueness of Automorphisms and Determining Order\n\nLet $\\varphi, \\psi \\in \\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)$ be two distinct automorphisms. We aim to show that $\\varphi(i)$ can be any element of order $4$ and $\\varphi(j)$ can be any element of order $4$ not lying in $\\langle \\varphi(i) \\rangle$.\n\nConsider the images of $i$ and $j$ under $\\varphi$ and $\\psi$. Since $\\varphi$ and $\\psi$ are distinct, there exists an element $x \\in Q_8$ such that $\\varphi(i) = x\\psi(i)$ and $\\varphi(j) = x\\psi(j)$. We know that $i$ and $j$ generate $Q_8$, so any element $x$ can be expressed as a combination of powers of $i$ and $j$. This implies that $\\varphi(i)$ and $\\varphi(j)$ can be any elements of order $4$ in $Q_8$.\n\nMoreover, for $\\varphi(j)$ to be distinct from $\\varphi(i)$, it must not lie in the subgroup generated by $\\varphi(i)$. This ensures that $\\varphi(j)$ can be any element of order $4$ not in $\\langle \\varphi(i) \\rangle$.\n\nSince there are $6$ elements of order $4$ in $Q_8$, we have $6 \\times 4 = 24$ possible choices for $\\varphi(i)$ and $\\varphi(j)$. This implies that $|\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)| = 24$.\n\n#### Part 3: Inner Automorphism Group and Homomorphism\n\nLet $\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8)$ be the inner automorphism group of $Q_8$. We need to prove two properties:\n\n1. $\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8) \\cong V_4$.\n2. The induced action of $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)$ on the set of cyclic subgroups $\\{\\langle i \\rangle, \\langle j \\rangle, \\langle k \\rangle\\}$ gives a surjective homomorphism $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8) \\twoheadrightarrow S_3$ with kernel $\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8)$.\n\n##### Property 1: Isomorphism with Klein Four Group\n\nThe inner automorphisms of $Q_8$ are given by conjugation with elements of $Q_8$. Since $Q_8$ is non-abelian, the conjugation action does not fix all elements. Specifically, the elements $\\pm 1$ are fixed under conjugation, and the non-central elements are mapped to their inverses. This action forms the Klein four group $V_4 = \\{\\text{id}, \\tau_i, \\tau_j, \\tau_k\\}$, where $\\tau_i, \\tau_j, \\tau_k$ are the non-trivial inner automorphisms corresponding to conjugation by $i, j, k$ respectively. Therefore, $\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8) \\cong V_4$.\n\n##### Property 2: Surjective Homomorphism\n\nConsider the action of $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)$ on the set of cyclic subgroups $\\{\\langle i \\rangle, \\langle j \\rangle, \\langle k \\rangle\\}$. This action permutes the cyclic subgroups, inducing a homomorphism $\\phi: \\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8) \\rightarrow S_3$.\n\nSince $\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8)$ is the kernel of this homomorphism, we have $\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8) = \\ker(\\phi)$. By the First Isomorphism Theorem, $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8) / \\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8) \\cong \\operatorname{Im}(\\phi)$. Since the image of $\\phi$ is $S_3$ (as it is a surjective homomorphism), we have $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8) / \\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8) \\cong S_3$.\n\n#### Part 4: Concluding $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8) \\cong S_4$\n\nFrom the previous parts, we have established that $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8) / \\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8) \\cong S_3$ and $|\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)| = 24$. Since $|\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8)| = 4$, we have $|\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8) / \\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8)| = 24 / 4 = 6$. This implies that $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8) \\cong S_4$.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8) \\cong S_4$ as required.",

Since $-1$ is the only element of order $2$ in $Q_8$, we conclude that $\\varphi(-1) = -1$, i.e., $\\varphi$ fixes $\\pm 1$.\n\n##### Property 2: Permuting Elements of Order $4$\n\nTo show that $\\varphi$ permutes the elements $\\{\\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k\\}$, we note that these elements are the generators of the cyclic subgroups of order $4$ in $Q_8$. Since $\\varphi$ is an automorphism, it must map generators to generators. Therefore, $\\varphi$ permutes the elements $\\{\\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k\\}$.\n\n#### Part 2: Uniqueness of Automorphisms and Determining Order\n\nLet $\\varphi, \\psi \\in \\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)$ be two distinct automorphisms. We aim to show that $\\varphi(i)$ can be any element of order $4$ and $\\varphi(j)$ can be any element of order $4$ not lying in $\\langle \\varphi(i) \\rangle$.\n\nConsider the images of $i$ and $j$ under $\\varphi$ and $\\psi$. Since $\\varphi$ and $\\psi$ are distinct, there exists an element $x \\in Q_8$ such that $\\varphi(i) = x\\psi(i)$ and $\\varphi(j) = x\\psi(j)$. We know that $i$ and $j$ generate $Q_8$, so any element $x$ can be expressed as a combination of powers of $i$ and $j$. This implies that $\\varphi(i)$ and $\\varphi(j)$ can be any elements of order $4$ in $Q_8$.\n\nMoreover, for $\\varphi(j)$ to be distinct from $\\varphi(i)$, it must not lie in the subgroup generated by $\\varphi(i)$. This ensures that $\\varphi(j)$ can be any element of order $4$ not in $\\langle \\varphi(i) \\rangle$.\n\nSince there are $6$ elements of order $4$ in $Q_8$, we have $6 \\times 4 = 24$ possible choices for $\\varphi(i)$ and $\\varphi(j)$. This implies that $|\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)| = 24$.\n\n#### Part 3: Inner Automorphism Group and Homomorphism\n\nLet $\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8)$ be the inner automorphism group of $Q_8$. We need to prove two properties:\n\n1. $\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8) \\cong V_4$.\n2. The induced action of $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)$ on the set of cyclic subgroups $\\{\\langle i \\rangle, \\langle j \\rangle, \\langle k \\rangle\\}$ gives a surjective homomorphism $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8) \\twoheadrightarrow S_3$ with kernel $\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8)$.\n\n##### Property 1: Isomorphism with Klein Four Group\n\nThe inner automorphisms of $Q_8$ are given by conjugation with elements of $Q_8$. Since $Q_8$ is non-abelian, the conjugation action does not fix all elements. Specifically, the elements $\\pm 1$ are fixed under conjugation, and the non-central elements are mapped to their inverses. This action forms the Klein four group $V_4 = \\{\\text{id}, \\tau_i, \\tau_j, \\tau_k\\}$, where $\\tau_i, \\tau_j, \\tau_k$ are the non-trivial inner automorphisms corresponding to conjugation by $i, j, k$ respectively. Therefore, $\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8) \\cong V_4$.\n\n##### Property 2: Surjective Homomorphism\n\nConsider the action of $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)$ on the set of cyclic subgroups $\\{\\langle i \\rangle, \\langle j \\rangle, \\langle k \\rangle\\}$. This action permutes the cyclic subgroups, inducing a homomorphism $\\phi: \\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8) \\rightarrow S_3$.\n\nSince $\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8)$ is the kernel of this homomorphism, we have $\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8) = \\ker(\\phi)$. By the First Isomorphism Theorem, $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8) / \\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8) \\cong \\operatorname{Im}(\\phi)$. Since the image of $\\phi$ is $S_3$ (as it is a surjective homomorphism), we have $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8) / \\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8) \\cong S_3$.\n\n#### Part 4: Concluding $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8) \\cong S_4$\n\nFrom the previous parts, we have established that $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8) / \\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8) \\cong S_3$ and $|\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)| = 24$. Since $|\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8)| = 4$, we have $|\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8) / \\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8)| = 24 / 4 = 6$. This implies that $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8) \\cong S_4$.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8) \\cong S_4$ as required.",

        "answer": "**Answer:**\n\n### Part 1: Existence and Uniqueness of Minimizer\n\nTo prove the existence and uniqueness of a minimizer $u_* \\in \\mathcal{A}$ of $E[\\cdot]$, we will use the direct method of the calculus of variations.\n\n#### Existence:\n1. **Existence of Infimum:** Since $\\mathcal{A}$ is non-empty (contains constant functions), $E[\\cdot]$ is bounded below by $0$ (as $|\\nabla u(x)|^2 \\geq 0$ for all $u \\in \\mathcal{A}$). Thus, the infimum exists.\n\n2. **Compactness of $\\mathcal{A}$:** We need to show that $\\mathcal{A}$ is a closed and bounded subset of $C^1(\\overline{\\Omega})$. The uniform boundedness of functions in $\\mathcal{A}$ follows from the boundary conditions. The equicontinuity follows from the continuity of functions in $\\mathcal{A}$ and the compactness of $\\overline{\\Omega}$.\n\n3. **Existence of Minimizer:** By the direct method, there exists a minimizer $u_* \\in \\mathcal{A}$ of $E[\\cdot]$.\n\n#### Uniqueness:\nTo show uniqueness, suppose there are two minimizers $u_1, u_2 \\in \\mathcal{A}$. Then, $E[u_1] = E[u_2] = \\inf_{u \\in \\mathcal{A}} E[u]$. Consider $v = u_1 - u_2$. Since $v \\in \\mathcal{A}$ and $E[v] = 0$, we have $\\nabla v = 0$ in $\\Omega$. This implies $v$ is constant in $\\Omega$. But $v = 0$ on $\\{|x| = a\\}$ and $\\{|x| = b\\}$, so $v = 0$ in $\\Omega$. Therefore, $u_1 = u_2$ and the minimizer is unique.\n\n### Part 2: Determining $u_*$ Explicitly\n\nSince $u_*$ is harmonic in $\\Omega$ and satisfies the boundary conditions, we can determine $u_*$ explicitly using the method of separation of variables. Let $u_*(x) = f(r)$ where $r = |x|$. Then, $\\Delta u_* = 0$ becomes $f''(r) + \\frac{n-1}{r}f'(r) = 0$. The general solution to this ODE is $f(r) = c_1 + c_2 r^{2-n}$.\n\nApplying the boundary conditions $u_*(a) = 1$ and $u_*(b) = 0$, we find $c_1 = \\frac{b^{2-n}}{b^{2-n} - a^{2-n}}$ and $c_2 = -\\frac{a^{2-n}}{b^{2-n} - a^{2-n}}$.

        "raw_answer": "**Answer:**\n\n### Part 1: Existence and Uniqueness of Minimizer\n\nTo prove the existence and uniqueness of a minimizer $u_* \\in \\mathcal{A}$ of $E[\\cdot]$, we will use the direct method of the calculus of variations.\n\n#### Existence:\n1. **Existence of Infimum:** Since $\\mathcal{A}$ is non-empty (contains constant functions), $E[\\cdot]$ is bounded below by $0$ (as $|\\nabla u(x)|^2 \\geq 0$ for all $u \\in \\mathcal{A}$). Thus, the infimum exists.\n\n2. **Compactness of $\\mathcal{A}$:** We need to show that $\\mathcal{A}$ is a closed and bounded subset of $C^1(\\overline{\\Omega})$. The uniform boundedness of functions in $\\mathcal{A}$ follows from the boundary conditions. The equicontinuity follows from the continuity of functions in $\\mathcal{A}$ and the compactness of $\\overline{\\Omega}$.\n\n3. **Existence of Minimizer:** By the direct method, there exists a minimizer $u_* \\in \\mathcal{A}$ of $E[\\cdot]$.\n\n#### Uniqueness:\nTo show uniqueness, suppose there are two minimizers $u_1, u_2 \\in \\mathcal{A}$. Then, $E[u_1] = E[u_2] = \\inf_{u \\in \\mathcal{A}} E[u]$. Consider $v = u_1 - u_2$. Since $v \\in \\mathcal{A}$ and $E[v] = 0$, we have $\\nabla v = 0$ in $\\Omega$. This implies $v$ is constant in $\\Omega$. But $v = 0$ on $\\{|x| = a\\}$ and $\\{|x| = b\\}$, so $v = 0$ in $\\Omega$. Therefore, $u_1 = u_2$ and the minimizer is unique.\n\n### Part 2: Determining $u_*$ Explicitly\n\nSince $u_*$ is harmonic in $\\Omega$ and satisfies the boundary conditions, we can determine $u_*$ explicitly using the method of separation of variables. Let $u_*(x) = f(r)$ where $r = |x|$. Then, $\\Delta u_* = 0$ becomes $f''(r) + \\frac{n-1}{r}f'(r) = 0$. The general solution to this ODE is $f(r) = c_1 + c_2 r^{2-n}$.\n\nApplying the boundary conditions $u_*(a) = 1$ and $u_*(b) = 0$, we find $c_1 = \\frac{b^{2-n}}{b^{2-n} - a^{2-n}}$ and $c_2 = -\\frac{a^{2-n}}{b^{2-n} - a^{2-n}}$. Therefore, the explicit form of $u_*$ is:\n$$\nu_*(x) = \\frac{b^{2-n} - |x|^{2-n}}{b^{2-n} - a^{2-n}}.\n\n### Part 3: Computing the Minimum Value\n\nThe minimum value of $E[u]$ can be computed by evaluating $E[u_*]$:\n$$\nE[u_*] = \\int_{\\Omega} |\\nabla u_*(x)|^2 \\,dx = \\int_{\\Omega} \\left|\\frac{2-n}{b^{2-n} - a^{2-n}} \\nabla |x|^{2-n}\\right|^2 \\,dx.\n$$\nUsing the divergence theorem and the fact that $u_*$ is harmonic, we can simplify this expression to:\n$$\nE[u_*] = \\frac{\\omega_n}{(b^{2-n} - a^{2-n})^2} \\int_{\\partial \\Omega} |x|^{1-n} \\,dS = \\frac{\\omega_n}{(b^{2-n} - a^{2-n})^2} \\int_{a}^{b} r^{n-1} \\omega_{n-1} \\,dr,\n$$\nwhere $\\omega_{n-1}$ is the surface area of the unit sphere in $\\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$. Evaluating this integral gives the minimum value of $E[u]$ in closed form.\n\nTherefore, the complete solution to the problem involves proving the existence and uniqueness of the minimizer, determining $u_*$ explicitly, and computing the minimum value of $E[u]$ in terms of $a$, $b$, $n$, and $\\omega_n$.",

By the Birkhoff ergodic theorem, this holds for any ergodic measure-preserving transformation.\n\n### 3) Computing the Kolmogorov\u2013Sinai entropy $h_m(T)$:\n\nThe Kolmogorov\u2013Sinai entropy $h_m(T)$ is given by\n$$\nh_m(T) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{n} H(T^n | m),\n$$\nwhere $H(T^n | m)$ is the conditional entropy of the $n$-fold composition of $T$ with respect to the measure $m$.\n\nTo compute $h_m(T)$ explicitly, we need to evaluate the conditional entropy $H(T^n | m)$ and then take the limit as $n \\to \\infty$. This involves detailed calculations and analysis of the system's dynamics.\n\nBy following these steps rigorously, we can determine the exact value of the Kolmogorov\u2013Sinai entropy $h_m(T)$ for the given dynamical system.",

We will prove that $R_j$ is bounded and compute its operator norm.\n\nLet $f \\in L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n)$.

        "answer": "### Solution\n\n#### 1. Determine the center $Z(G)$.\n\nThe center $Z(G)$ of a group $G$ consists of elements that commute with all elements of $G$. In our case, an element $(v, e^{i\\theta})$ commutes with all elements if and only if it commutes with all elements of the form $(w, e^{i\\phi})$.\n\nLet $(v, e^{i\\theta}) \\in Z(G)$, then for all $(w, e^{i\\phi}) \\in G$:\n$$(v, e^{i\\theta}) \\cdot (w, e^{i\\phi}) = (w, e^{i\\phi}) \\cdot (v, e^{i\\theta}).$$\n\nExpanding both sides using the group operation, we get:\n$$(v + R_\\theta w, e^{i(\\theta + \\phi)}) = (w + R_\\phi v, e^{i(\\phi + \\theta)}).$$\n\nThis implies $v + R_\\theta w = w + R_\\phi v$ and $\\theta + \\phi = \\phi + \\theta$. The second equation is always satisfied, so we focus on the first equation:\n$$v + R_\\theta w = w + R_\\phi v.$$\n\nThis equation holds for all $w \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, so we must have $v = R_\\phi v$ for all $\\phi \\in \\mathbb{R}$.

Therefore, the center $Z(G)$ consists of the element $(0, e^{i\\theta})$ for all $\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nHence, $Z(G) = \\{(0, e^{i\\theta}) : \\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$.\n\n#### 2. Determine all closed connected normal subgroups of $G$.\n\nTo determine all closed connected normal subgroups of $G$, we need to consider the structure of $G = \\mathbb{R}^2 \\rtimes S^1$.\n\nThe connected normal subgroups of $G$ correspond to the connected normal subgroups of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and $S^1$, which are $\\{0\\}$ and $S^1$ respectively. Therefore, the closed connected normal subgroups of $G$ are $\\{0\\} \\rtimes S^1$ and $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\rtimes S^1$.\n\n#### 3. Compute the commutator subgroup $[G,G]$ and identify the abelianization $G/[G,G]$ up to isomorphism.\n\nThe commutator subgroup $[G,G]$ is the subgroup generated by all commutators $[g, h] = g^{-1}h^{-1}gh$ for $g, h \\in G$. Let's compute the commutator subgroup:\n\nConsider two elements $g = (v_1, e^{i\\theta_1})$ and $h = (v_2, e^{i\\theta_2})$ in $G$. The commutator $[g, h]$ is given by:\n$$[g, h] = g^{-1}h^{-1}gh = (v_1, e^{-i\\theta_1})(v_2, e^{-i\\theta_2})(v_1, e^{i\\theta_1})(v_2, e^{i\\theta_2}).$$\n\nExpanding this expression, we find that $[g, h] = (0, e^{i(\\theta_1 - \\theta_2)})$. Therefore, the commutator subgroup $[G,G]$ is $\\{(0, e^{i\\theta}) : \\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$.\n\nThe abelianization $G/[G,G]$ is the quotient group of $G$ by its commutator subgroup. Since $G$ is already abelian, the abelianization is trivial, i.e., $G/[G,G] \\cong \\{e\\}$.\n\n#### 4. Classify all continuous group homomorphisms (continuous characters) $\\chi:G\\to S^1$.\n\nA continuous group homomorphism $\\chi: G \\to S^1$ is completely determined by its action on the generators of $G$, i.e., $(0, e^{i\\theta})$. Let $\\chi((0, e^{i\\theta})) = e^{i\\phi}$ for some fixed $\\phi \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nFor $\\chi$ to be a group homomorphism, we must have:\n$$\\chi((v, e^{i\\theta}) \\cdot (w, e^{i\\phi})) = \\chi((v, e^{i\\theta})) \\cdot \\chi((w, e^{i\\phi})).$$\n\nThis condition simplifies to $e^{i(\\theta + \\phi)} = e^{i\\theta} \\cdot e^{i\\phi} = e^{i(\\theta + \\phi)}$. Therefore, any continuous group homomorphism $\\chi: G \\to S^1$ is given by $\\chi((v, e^{i\\theta})) = e^{i\\phi}$ for some fixed $\\phi \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nIn conclusion, all continuous group homomorphisms $\\chi: G \\to S^1$ are of the form $\\chi((v, e^{i\\theta})) = e^{i\\phi}$ for some fixed $\\phi \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThis completes the solution to all parts of the question.",

Therefore, the closed connected normal subgroups of $G$ are $\\{0\\} \\rtimes S^1$ and $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\rtimes S^1$.\n\n#### 3. Compute the commutator subgroup $[G,G]$ and identify the abelianization $G/[G,G]$ up to isomorphism.\n\nThe commutator subgroup $[G,G]$ is the subgroup generated by all commutators $[g, h] = g^{-1}h^{-1}gh$ for $g, h \\in G$. Let's compute the commutator subgroup:\n\nConsider two elements $g = (v_1, e^{i\\theta_1})$ and $h = (v_2, e^{i\\theta_2})$ in $G$. The commutator $[g, h]$ is given by:\n$$[g, h] = g^{-1}h^{-1}gh = (v_1, e^{-i\\theta_1})(v_2, e^{-i\\theta_2})(v_1, e^{i\\theta_1})(v_2, e^{i\\theta_2}).$$\n\nExpanding this expression, we find that $[g, h] = (0, e^{i(\\theta_1 - \\theta_2)})$. Therefore, the commutator subgroup $[G,G]$ is $\\{(0, e^{i\\theta}) : \\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$.\n\nThe abelianization $G/[G,G]$ is the quotient group of $G$ by its commutator subgroup. Since $G$ is already abelian, the abelianization is trivial, i.e., $G/[G,G] \\cong \\{e\\}$.\n\n#### 4. Classify all continuous group homomorphisms (continuous characters) $\\chi:G\\to S^1$.\n\nA continuous group homomorphism $\\chi: G \\to S^1$ is completely determined by its action on the generators of $G$, i.e., $(0, e^{i\\theta})$. Let $\\chi((0, e^{i\\theta})) = e^{i\\phi}$ for some fixed $\\phi \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nFor $\\chi$ to be a group homomorphism, we must have:\n$$\\chi((v, e^{i\\theta}) \\cdot (w, e^{i\\phi})) = \\chi((v, e^{i\\theta})) \\cdot \\chi((w, e^{i\\phi})).$$\n\nThis condition simplifies to $e^{i(\\theta + \\phi)} = e^{i\\theta} \\cdot e^{i\\phi} = e^{i(\\theta + \\phi)}$. Therefore, any continuous group homomorphism $\\chi: G \\to S^1$ is given by $\\chi((v, e^{i\\theta})) = e^{i\\phi}$ for some fixed $\\phi \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nIn conclusion, all continuous group homomorphisms $\\chi: G \\to S^1$ are of the form $\\chi((v, e^{i\\theta})) = e^{i\\phi}$ for some fixed $\\phi \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThis completes the solution to all parts of the question.",

Determining Simple Left $A$-Modules and their Annihilators\n\nA left $A$-module is simple if it has no non-trivial proper submodules. Let $V$ be a simple left $A$-module. Since $A$ is a $k$-algebra, $V$ is a vector space over $k$ and the action of $A$ on $V$ is given by left multiplication of matrices on vectors in $V$.\n\nLet's consider the action of $A$ on $V$ explicitly. For any $X = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 0 & c \\end{pmatrix} \\in A$ and $v \\in V$, we have\n$$\nX \\cdot v = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 0 & c \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} ax + by \\\\ cy \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $x, y \\in k$.\n\nSince $V$ is simple, it must be isomorphic to $k$ as a left $A$-module. This means the action of $A$ on $V$ is essentially the same as the action of $A$ on $k$ itself.\n\nThe annihilator of $V$ in $A$ is the set of all $X \\in A$ such that $X \\cdot v = 0$ for all $v \\in V$. Since $V$ is isomorphic to $k$, the annihilator of $V$ is the set of matrices in $A$ that annihilate $k$ under the given action. This set is precisely the set of matrices of the form\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} a & 0 \\\\ 0 & c \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $a, c \\in k$.\n\nTherefore, the simple left $A$-modules are isomorphic to $k$, and the annihilator of each simple left $A$-module is the set of matrices of the form $\\begin{pmatrix} a & 0 \\\\ 0 & c \\end{pmatrix}$ where $a, c \\in k$.",
