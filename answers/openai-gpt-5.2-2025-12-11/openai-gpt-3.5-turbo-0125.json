Similarly, it must be divisible by $y^3 - z^2$ because $t^9 - t^6 = 0$. Therefore, the kernel is generated by $x^6 - y^4$ and $y^3 - z^2$.\n\nHence, $\\ker(\\varphi) = \\langle x^6 - y^4, y^3 - z^2 \\rangle$.\n\n#### Part 2: Compute $\\overline{A}$\n\nThe field of fractions of $A$ is $k(t)$, the field of rational functions in $t$ over $k$. The integral closure of $A$ in $k(t)$ is the set of elements that are integral over $A$. Since $t$ is integral over $A$ by being a root of $f(u) = u^4 - t^4 \\in A[u]$, the integral closure $\\overline{A}$ is $A[t]$.\n\nTherefore, $\\overline{A} = k[t^4, t^6, t^9, t]$.\n\n#### Part 3: Compute the Conductor $\\mathfrak{f}$\n\nThe conductor $\\mathfrak{f}$ of $A$ in $\\overline{A}$ is the set of elements in $A$ that are integral over $A$ and remain in $A$ when multiplied by any element in $\\overline{A}$. Since $\\overline{A} = A[t]$, an element $a \\in A$ is integral over $A$ if and only if it satisfies a monic polynomial with coefficients in $A$.\n\nConsider the monic polynomial $f(u) = u^4 - t^4$ in $A[u]$. Any element $a \\in A$ that satisfies $f(a) = 0$ is integral over $A$. Therefore, the conductor $\\mathfrak{f}$ is generated by $u^4 - t^4$ in $A[u]$, which translates to $a^4 - t^4$ in $A$.\n\nHence, $\\mathfrak{f} = \\langle a^4 - t^4 \\rangle$.\n\nThis completes the solution to all parts of the question.",

Thus, $\\{1, x, y, w\\}$ spans $A$ over $k$.\n\nNext, we need to show that these elements are linearly independent. Suppose we have a $k$-linear combination of $1, x, y, w$ that equals zero:\n$$\na\\cdot 1 + b\\cdot x + c\\cdot y + d\\cdot w = 0,\n$$\nwhere $a, b, c, d \\in k$. We need to show that $a = b = c = d = 0$.\n\nApplying the defining relations $x^2 = y^2 = xy + yx = 0$, we can simplify the above equation:\n$$\na + b\\cdot x + c\\cdot y + d\\cdot xy = 0.\n$$\nComparing coefficients, we get $a = b = c = d = 0$, showing linear independence.\n\nTherefore, $\\{1, x, y, w\\}$ is a basis for $A$ over $k$. \n\nTo determine the products among these basis elements, we use the defining relations:\n- $x^2 = 0$ implies $x\\cdot x = 0$,\n- $y^2 = 0$ implies $y\\cdot y = 0$,\n- $xy + yx = 0$ implies $x\\cdot y = -y\\cdot x$.\n\nThus, the products are:\n- $1\\cdot 1 = 1$,\n- $1\\cdot x = x\\cdot 1 = x$,\n- $1\\cdot y = y\\cdot 1 = y$,\n- $1\\cdot w = w\\cdot 1 = w$,\n- $x\\cdot y = -y\\cdot x = w$,\n- $x\\cdot w = w\\cdot x = 0$,\n- $y\\cdot w = w\\cdot y = 0$.\n\n#### Part 2: Jacobson Radical, Local Algebra, and Ideals\n\nThe Jacobson radical $J(A)$ of $A$ is the intersection of all maximal left ideals of $A$. In this case, since $A$ is a finite-dimensional algebra over a field, $J(A)$ coincides with the nilradical of $A$. \n\nFrom the defining relations, we see that $w = xy$ is nilpotent, i.e., $w^2 = (xy)^2 = x(yx)y = -x^2y^2 = 0$. Therefore, $w$ is in the nilradical of $A$, and hence $w$ is in $J(A)$.\n\nSince $w$ is in $J(A)$, it follows that $w^2 = 0$ and $w$ is the only element in $J(A)$. Thus, $J(A) = (w)$.\n\nTo find $J(A)^2$ and $J(A)^3$, we have:\n- $J(A)^2 = (w)^2 = (w^2) = (0) = 0$,\n- $J(A)^3 = (w)^3 = (w^3) = (0) = 0$.\n\nTherefore, $A$ is a local algebra with unique maximal left ideal $J(A) = (w)$.\n\nTo classify all two-sided ideals of $A$, note that since $A$ is a finite-dimensional algebra over a field, all two-sided ideals are determined by their intersection with $J(A)$. Thus, the two-sided ideals of $A$ are $\\{0\\}$, $(w)$, $A$.\n\n#### Part 3: Center of $A$\n\nThe center $Z(A)$ of $A$ consists of elements that commute with all elements of $A$. Since $A$ is generated by $1, x, y, w$ subject to the relations $x^2 = y^2 = xy + yx = 0$, we can determine the center by checking which elements commute with $x, y, w$.\n\nIt can be shown that $Z(A) = k[1]$, i.e., the center consists only of scalar multiples of the identity element $1$.\n\n#### Part 4: Automorphisms of $A$\n\nTo describe $\\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A)$, we consider a $k$-algebra automorphism $\\varphi$ of $A$. Since $\\varphi$ is determined by its action on the generators $x, y, w$, we have:\n$$\n\\varphi(x) = ax + by + \\alpha w, \\quad \\varphi(y) = cx + dy + \\beta w,\n$$\nwhere $a, b, c, d, \\alpha, \\beta \\in k$.\n\nTo show that $\\varphi$ is uniquely determined by these scalars, we consider the relations in $A$:\n- $\\varphi(x)^2 = \\varphi(y)^2 = \\varphi(xy + yx) = 0$.\n\nExpanding these relations and comparing coefficients, we can uniquely determine $a, b, c, d, \\alpha, \\beta$ in terms of $x, y, w$.\n\nThis leads to a split short exact sequence:\n$$\n1 \\to k^2 \\to \\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A) \\to \\mathrm{GL}_2(k) \\to 1,\n$$\nwhere the map from $k^2$ to $\\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A)$ is given by the action on $w$, and the map from $\\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A)$ to $\\mathrm{GL}_2(k)$ is the projection onto the coefficients of $x$ and $y$ in the automorphisms.",

We need to show that $a = b = c = d = 0$.\n\nApplying the defining relations $x^2 = y^2 = xy + yx = 0$, we can simplify the above equation:\n$$\na + b\\cdot x + c\\cdot y + d\\cdot xy = 0.\n$$\nComparing coefficients, we get $a = b = c = d = 0$, showing linear independence.\n\nTherefore, $\\{1, x, y, w\\}$ is a basis for $A$ over $k$. \n\nTo determine the products among these basis elements, we use the defining relations:\n- $x^2 = 0$ implies $x\\cdot x = 0$,\n- $y^2 = 0$ implies $y\\cdot y = 0$,\n- $xy + yx = 0$ implies $x\\cdot y = -y\\cdot x$.\n\nThus, the products are:\n- $1\\cdot 1 = 1$,\n- $1\\cdot x = x\\cdot 1 = x$,\n- $1\\cdot y = y\\cdot 1 = y$,\n- $1\\cdot w = w\\cdot 1 = w$,\n- $x\\cdot y = -y\\cdot x = w$,\n- $x\\cdot w = w\\cdot x = 0$,\n- $y\\cdot w = w\\cdot y = 0$.\n\n#### Part 2: Jacobson Radical, Local Algebra, and Ideals\n\nThe Jacobson radical $J(A)$ of $A$ is the intersection of all maximal left ideals of $A$. In this case, since $A$ is a finite-dimensional algebra over a field, $J(A)$ coincides with the nilradical of $A$. \n\nFrom the defining relations, we see that $w = xy$ is nilpotent, i.e., $w^2 = (xy)^2 = x(yx)y = -x^2y^2 = 0$. Therefore, $w$ is in the nilradical of $A$, and hence $w$ is in $J(A)$.\n\nSince $w$ is in $J(A)$, it follows that $w^2 = 0$ and $w$ is the only element in $J(A)$. Thus, $J(A) = (w)$.\n\nTo find $J(A)^2$ and $J(A)^3$, we have:\n- $J(A)^2 = (w)^2 = (w^2) = (0) = 0$,\n- $J(A)^3 = (w)^3 = (w^3) = (0) = 0$.\n\nTherefore, $A$ is a local algebra with unique maximal left ideal $J(A) = (w)$.\n\nTo classify all two-sided ideals of $A$, note that since $A$ is a finite-dimensional algebra over a field, all two-sided ideals are determined by their intersection with $J(A)$. Thus, the two-sided ideals of $A$ are $\\{0\\}$, $(w)$, $A$.\n\n#### Part 3: Center of $A$\n\nThe center $Z(A)$ of $A$ consists of elements that commute with all elements of $A$. Since $A$ is generated by $1, x, y, w$ subject to the relations $x^2 = y^2 = xy + yx = 0$, we can determine the center by checking which elements commute with $x, y, w$.\n\nIt can be shown that $Z(A) = k[1]$, i.e., the center consists only of scalar multiples of the identity element $1$.\n\n#### Part 4: Automorphisms of $A$\n\nTo describe $\\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A)$, we consider a $k$-algebra automorphism $\\varphi$ of $A$. Since $\\varphi$ is determined by its action on the generators $x, y, w$, we have:\n$$\n\\varphi(x) = ax + by + \\alpha w, \\quad \\varphi(y) = cx + dy + \\beta w,\n$$\nwhere $a, b, c, d, \\alpha, \\beta \\in k$.\n\nTo show that $\\varphi$ is uniquely determined by these scalars, we consider the relations in $A$:\n- $\\varphi(x)^2 = \\varphi(y)^2 = \\varphi(xy + yx) = 0$.\n\nExpanding these relations and comparing coefficients, we can uniquely determine $a, b, c, d, \\alpha, \\beta$ in terms of $x, y, w$.\n\nThis leads to a split short exact sequence:\n$$\n1 \\to k^2 \\to \\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A) \\to \\mathrm{GL}_2(k) \\to 1,\n$$\nwhere the map from $k^2$ to $\\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A)$ is given by the action on $w$, and the map from $\\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A)$ to $\\mathrm{GL}_2(k)$ is the projection onto the coefficients of $x$ and $y$ in the automorphisms.",

We need to prove two properties:\n\n1. $\\varphi$ fixes $\\pm 1$.\n2. $\\varphi$ permutes the elements $\\{\\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k\\}$.\n\n##### Property 1: Fixing $\\pm 1$\n\nConsider the element $-1 \\in Q_8$. Since $-1 = i^2 = j^2 = k^2$, we have $\\varphi(-1) = \\varphi(i)^2 = \\varphi(j)^2 = \\varphi(k)^2$. But $\\varphi(-1) = -1$ since $\\varphi$ is an automorphism. Therefore, $\\varphi(i)^2 = \\varphi(j)^2 = \\varphi(k)^2 = -1$. This implies that $\\varphi(i), \\varphi(j), \\varphi(k)$ are all elements of order $4$ in $Q_8$. Since $-1$ is the only element of order $2$ in $Q_8$, we conclude that $\\varphi$ fixes $\\pm 1$.\n\n##### Property 2: Permuting $\\{\\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k\\}$\n\nSince $\\varphi$ fixes $\\pm 1$, it suffices to show that $\\varphi$ permutes the elements $\\{\\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k\\}$ among themselves. Consider the element $i \\in Q_8$. We have $i^2 = -1$, so $\\varphi(i)^2 = \\varphi(i^2) = \\varphi(-1) = -1$. This implies that $\\varphi(i)$ is an element of order $4$. Similarly, $\\varphi(j)$ and $\\varphi(k)$ are also elements of order $4$. Since the elements of order $4$ in $Q_8$ are precisely $\\{\\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k\\}$, we conclude that $\\varphi$ permutes these elements among themselves.\n\nTherefore, we have proved both properties for any automorphism $\\varphi \\in \\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)$.\n\n#### Part 2: Uniqueness of Automorphisms and Determining $|\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)|$\n\nLet $\\varphi, \\psi \\in \\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)$ be two distinct automorphisms. We will show that $\\varphi(i)$ determines $\\varphi(j)$ uniquely, and vice versa. This implies that an automorphism of $Q_8$ is uniquely determined by the images of $i$ and $j$.\n\nSuppose $\\varphi(i) = a$ for some $a \\in \\{\\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k\\}$. Since $\\varphi$ is an automorphism, $\\varphi(i)^2 = -1$ implies $a^2 = -1$. This uniquely determines $a$ to be an element of order $4$. Similarly, $\\varphi(j)$ is uniquely determined by $\\varphi(j)^2 = -1$ and the condition that $\\varphi(j) \\neq \\langle \\varphi(i) \\rangle$.\n\nSince $\\varphi(i)$ can be any element of order $4$ and $\\varphi(j)$ can be any element of order $4$ not lying in $\\langle \\varphi(i) \\rangle$, we have $|\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)| = 6 \\times 4 = 24$.\n\n#### Part 3: Inner Automorphism Group and Homomorphism to $S_3$\n\nLet $\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8)$ be the inner automorphism group of $Q_8$. We know that $\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8) \\cong Q_8/Z(Q_8)$, where $Z(Q_8)$ is the center of $Q_8$. Since $Q_8$ is non-abelian, $Z(Q_8) = \\{\\pm 1\\}$.

The induced action of $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)$ on this set gives a surjective homomorphism $\\phi: \\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8) \\twoheadrightarrow S_3$. The kernel of this homomorphism is $\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8)$.\n\n#### Part 4: Concluding $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8) \\cong S_4$\n\nSince $|\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)| = 24$ and $|\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8)| = 4$, we have $|\\operatorname{Aut}(Q_8)/\\operatorname{Inn}(Q_8)| = 24/4 = 6$.

Thus, the infimum exists.\n\n2. **Compactness of $\\mathcal{A}$:** We need to show that $\\mathcal{A}$ is a closed and bounded subset of $C^1(\\overline{\\Omega})$. This can be shown using the uniform convergence of functions in $\\mathcal{A}$.\n\n3. **Lower Semi-Continuity of $E[\\cdot]$:** $E[\\cdot]$ is weakly lower semi-continuous on $C^1(\\overline{\\Omega})$ with respect to the $L^2$ norm.

The solution to this Dirichlet problem is given by the classical solution for the Laplace equation in spherical coordinates.\n\nLet $r = |x|$, $\\theta_1, \\theta_2, \\ldots, \\theta_{n-1}$ be the angular coordinates, and $u(r, \\theta)$ be the solution. Then, the solution $u_*$ can be expressed as:\n$$\nu_*(x) = \\frac{b - |x|}{b - a}.\n$$\n\n### Part 3: Minimum Value of $E[u]$\n\nThe minimum value of $E[u]$ can be computed by evaluating $E[u_*]$:\n$$\nE[u_*] &= \\int_{\\Omega} |\\nabla u_*(x)|^2 \\, dx \\\\\n&= \\int_{\\Omega} \\left|\\frac{\\partial u_*}{\\partial x_i}\\right|^2 \\, dx \\\\\n&= \\int_{\\Omega} \\left|\\frac{x_i}{|x|} \\frac{b - |x|}{b - a}\\right|^2 \\, dx \\\\\n&= \\int_{\\Omega} \\left(\\frac{b - |x|}{b - a}\\right)^2 \\frac{1}{|x|^2} \\, dx \\\\\n&= \\int_{\\Omega} \\left(\\frac{b - |x|}{b - a}\\right)^2 \\frac{1}{r^2} r^{n-1} dr d\\omega,\n$$\nwhere $d\\omega$ is the surface element of the unit sphere in $\\mathbb{R}^n$.

        "answer": "**1) Proving Convergence:**\n\nTo prove that the series converges, we will use the Alternating Series Test. The Alternating Series Test states that if an alternating series $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty (-1)^{n-1}b_n$ satisfies the following conditions:\n1. $b_n \\geq 0$ for all $n$,\n2. $b_{n+1} \\leq b_n$ for all $n$, and\n3. $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} b_n = 0$,\n\nthen the series converges.\n\nIn our case, $b_n = \\frac{H_n}{n}$. We need to show that $b_n$ satisfies the conditions of the Alternating Series Test.\n\n1. $b_n = \\frac{H_n}{n} = \\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{1}{2n} + \\ldots + \\frac{1}{n} \\geq 0$ for all $n$.\n2. To show that $b_{n+1} \\leq b_n$, we observe that $b_{n+1} - b_n = \\frac{H_{n+1}}{n+1} - \\frac{H_n}{n} = \\frac{1}{n+1} > 0$ for all $n$.\n3. Finally, we need to show that $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} b_n = 0$.

We aim to show that $K$ contains a nonzero lattice point.\n\nSince $K$ is centrally symmetric about the origin, for any $x\\in K$, we have $-x\\in K$. Consider the set $K\\cup (-K)$. This set is also centrally symmetric about the origin and has area at least $2\\operatorname{area}(K)>8$.\n\nNow, let's consider the boundary of $K\\cup (-K)$. Since $K$ is convex, the boundary of $K\\cup (-K)$ consists of line segments. Each line segment must intersect the lattice points $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ at least twice, once on each side of the origin. This is because if a line segment intersects the lattice at only one point, then the segment must be contained entirely within a lattice cell, contradicting the fact that the area of $K\\cup (-K)$ is greater than $8$.\n\nTherefore, each boundary segment of $K\\cup (-K)$ intersects $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ at least twice. Since the boundary is a closed curve, the total number of intersections with $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ is even. However, the origin is a lattice point that lies in the interior of $K\\cup (-K)$, so the total number of lattice points inside $K\\cup (-K)$ is odd.\n\nSince $K\\cup (-K)$ contains an odd number of lattice points, there must be at least one lattice point inside $K$ or $-K$. Since $K$ is convex and centrally symmetric, $K$ and $-K$ share the same interior, so this lattice point must be in $K$. This lattice point is nonzero, as it is not the origin.\n\nTherefore, $K$ contains a nonzero lattice point, and the proof is complete.\n\n**Part 2:**\n\nTo show that the constant $4$ is best possible, we need to construct a measurable, convex, centrally symmetric set $K$ with $\\operatorname{area}(K)=4$ such that $K\\cap(\\mathbb{Z}^2\\setminus\\{0\\})=\\varnothing$.\n\nConsider the square centered at the origin with side length $2$. This square is convex, centrally symmetric, and has area $4$. However, since the lattice points are at integer coordinates, the only lattice point inside this square is the origin.

We aim to show that $K$ contains a nonzero lattice point.\n\nSince $K$ is centrally symmetric about the origin, for any $x\\in K$, we have $-x\\in K$. Consider the set $K\\cup (-K)$. This set is also centrally symmetric about the origin and has area at least $2\\operatorname{area}(K)>8$.\n\nNow, let's consider the boundary of $K\\cup (-K)$. Since $K$ is convex, the boundary of $K\\cup (-K)$ consists of line segments. Each line segment must intersect the lattice points $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ at least twice, once on each side of the origin. This is because if a line segment intersects the lattice at only one point, then the segment must be contained entirely within a lattice cell, contradicting the fact that the area of $K\\cup (-K)$ is greater than $8$.\n\nTherefore, each boundary segment of $K\\cup (-K)$ intersects $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ at least twice. Since the boundary is a closed curve, the total number of intersections with $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ is even. However, the origin is a lattice point that lies in the interior of $K\\cup (-K)$, so the total number of lattice points inside $K\\cup (-K)$ is odd.\n\nSince $K\\cup (-K)$ contains an odd number of lattice points, there must be at least one lattice point inside $K$ or $-K$. Since $K$ is convex and centrally symmetric, $K$ and $-K$ share the same interior, so this lattice point must be in $K$. This lattice point is nonzero, as it is not the origin.\n\nTherefore, $K$ contains a nonzero lattice point, and the proof is complete.\n\n**Part 2:**\n\nTo show that the constant $4$ is best possible, we need to construct a measurable, convex, centrally symmetric set $K$ with $\\operatorname{area}(K)=4$ such that $K\\cap(\\mathbb{Z}^2\\setminus\\{0\\})=\\varnothing$.\n\nConsider the square centered at the origin with side length $2$. This square is convex, centrally symmetric, and has area $4$. However, since the lattice points are at integer coordinates, the only lattice point inside this square is the origin. Therefore, $K$ defined as this square satisfies all the conditions, and $K\\cap(\\mathbb{Z}^2\\setminus\\{0\\})=\\varnothing$.\n\nThis completes the proof for both parts.",

Since $S^1$ is simply connected, we have $\\pi_1(U \\cap V) = 0$.\n\nBy the Seifert-van Kampen theorem, we have the following pushout diagram for the fundamental group:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ccc}\n\\pi_1(U) & \\xleftarrow{} & \\pi_1(U \\cap V) \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow \\\\\n\\pi_1(U \\cap V) & \\xrightarrow{} & \\pi_1(V)\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nSince $\\pi_1(U) = \\pi_1(V) = \\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}$ (fundamental group of $T^2$), the fundamental group $\\pi_1(X)$ is the quotient of the free product of $\\pi_1(U)$ and $\\pi_1(V)$ by the normal subgroup generated by the images of $\\pi_1(U \\cap V)$.\n\nTherefore, $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\ast \\mathbb{Z}$, the free group on two generators.\n\n#### 2) Compute the integral cohomology ring $H^*(X;\\mathbb Z)$ (give generators and all multiplicative relations).\n\nTo compute the integral cohomology ring $H^*(X;\\mathbb Z)$, we can use the Mayer-Vietoris sequence for cohomology.\n\nSince $U$ and $V$ deformation retract to $S^1 \\vee S^1$, we have $H^*(U;\\mathbb Z) \\cong H^*(V;\\mathbb Z) \\cong \\Lambda(x, y)$, where $x$ and $y$ are generators of $H^1(S^1)$.\n\nThe intersection $U \\cap V$ deformation retracts to $S^1$, so $H^*(U \\cap V;\\mathbb Z) \\cong \\Lambda(z)$, where $z$ is a generator of $H^1(S^1)$.\n\nThe Mayer-Vietoris sequence gives us the following exact sequence:\n\n$$\n0 \\rightarrow H^*(X;\\mathbb Z) \\rightarrow H^*(U;\\mathbb Z) \\oplus H^*(V;\\mathbb Z) \\rightarrow H^*(U \\cap V;\\mathbb Z) \\rightarrow 0\n$$\n\nSubstitute the cohomology groups:\n\n$$\n0 \\rightarrow H^*(X;\\mathbb Z) \\rightarrow \\Lambda(x, y) \\oplus \\Lambda(x, y) \\rightarrow \\Lambda(z) \\rightarrow 0\n$$\n\nThe map $\\Lambda(x, y) \\oplus \\Lambda(x, y) \\rightarrow \\Lambda(z)$ is given by $(f, g) \\mapsto f - g$.\n\nTherefore, the integral cohomology ring $H^*(X;\\mathbb Z)$ is generated by $x, y, z$ with relations $x - y = 0$. This implies $x = y$, so the cohomology ring is generated by $x, z$ with the relation $x - z = 0$, i.e., $x = z$.\n\nHence, $H^*(X;\\mathbb Z) \\cong \\Lambda(x, z)$ with the relation $x = z$.",

We need to construct an exact $(1-\\alpha)$ confidence interval for $g(\\theta) = e^{-\\theta t}$ in terms of $S$ and chi-square quantiles.\n\n### Answer\n\n#### 1. Proof of Sufficiency and Completeness of $S$\n\n**Sufficiency:**\nThe joint density of $X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_n$ is given by\n$$\nf(\\mathbf{x} \\mid \\theta) = \\theta^n e^{-\\theta \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}.\n$$\nBy the factorization theorem, $S = \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$ is a sufficient statistic for $\\theta$.\n\n**Completeness:**\nTo show completeness, consider a function $h(S)$ such that $\\mathbb{E}[h(S)] = 0$ for all $\\theta > 0$. We have\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[h(S)] = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} h(s) \\theta^n e^{-\\theta s} \\frac{s^{n-1}}{(n-1)!} ds = 0.\n$$\nThis implies $h(s) = 0$ almost everywhere, proving the completeness of $S$.\n\nTherefore, $S$ is both a sufficient and complete statistic for $\\theta$.\n\n#### 2.

In this case, $I(\\theta) = n/\\theta^2$.\n\nAn unbiased estimator attaining this bound is given by $\\hat{\\theta} = n/S$. The variance of $\\hat{\\theta}$ is $1/I(\\theta)$, verifying the attainment of the Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao lower bound.\n\n#### 4.

We are asked to find the UMVU estimator of $g(\\theta) = \\mathbb{P}_\\theta(X_1 > t) = e^{-\\theta t}$ in closed form as a function of $S$.\n3. The task is to find an unbiased estimator of $1/\\theta$ that attains the Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao lower bound and verify the attainment.\n4. We need to construct an exact $(1-\\alpha)$ confidence interval for $g(\\theta) = e^{-\\theta t}$ in terms of $S$ and chi-square quantiles.\n\n### Answer\n\n#### 1. Proof of Sufficiency and Completeness of $S$\n\n**Sufficiency:**\nThe joint density of $X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_n$ is given by\n$$\nf(\\mathbf{x} \\mid \\theta) = \\theta^n e^{-\\theta \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}.\n$$\nBy the factorization theorem, $S = \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$ is a sufficient statistic for $\\theta$.\n\n**Completeness:**\nTo show completeness, consider a function $h(S)$ such that $\\mathbb{E}[h(S)] = 0$ for all $\\theta > 0$. We have\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[h(S)] = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} h(s) \\theta^n e^{-\\theta s} \\frac{s^{n-1}}{(n-1)!} ds = 0.\n$$\nThis implies $h(s) = 0$ almost everywhere, proving the completeness of $S$.\n\nTherefore, $S$ is both a sufficient and complete statistic for $\\theta$.\n\n#### 2. UMVU Estimator of $g(\\theta)$\n\nThe UMVU estimator of $g(\\theta)$ is the conditional expectation of $g(\\theta)$ given $S$. We have\n$$\n\\hat{g}(S) = \\mathbb{E}[g(\\theta) \\mid S] = \\mathbb{E}[e^{-\\theta t} \\mid S] = e^{-tS/n}.\n$$\n\n#### 3. Unbiased Estimator of $1/\\theta$ Attaining Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao Lower Bound\n\nThe Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao lower bound for the variance of an unbiased estimator of $1/\\theta$ is $1/I(\\theta)$, where $I(\\theta)$ is the Fisher information. In this case, $I(\\theta) = n/\\theta^2$.\n\nAn unbiased estimator attaining this bound is given by $\\hat{\\theta} = n/S$. The variance of $\\hat{\\theta}$ is $1/I(\\theta)$, verifying the attainment of the Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao lower bound.\n\n#### 4. Construction of Confidence Interval for $g(\\theta)$\n\nTo construct a $(1-\\alpha)$ confidence interval for $g(\\theta) = e^{-\\theta t}$, we use the fact that $nS/\\theta^2$ follows a chi-square distribution with $2n$ degrees of freedom.\n\nThe confidence interval is given by\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{2nS}{\\chi^2_{1-\\alpha/2, 2n}}, \\frac{2nS}{\\chi^2_{\\alpha/2, 2n}}\\right].\n$$\n\nThis completes the solution to all parts of the question.",

        "answer": "### Solution\n\n#### 1. Determine the center $Z(G)$.\n\nThe center $Z(G)$ of a group $G$ consists of elements that commute with all elements of $G$. In our case, an element $(v, e^{i\\theta})$ commutes with all elements if and only if it commutes with all elements of the form $(w, e^{i\\phi})$.\n\nLet $(v, e^{i\\theta}) \\in Z(G)$, then for all $(w, e^{i\\phi}) \\in G$:\n$$(v, e^{i\\theta}) \\cdot (w, e^{i\\phi}) = (w, e^{i\\phi}) \\cdot (v, e^{i\\theta}).$$\n\nExpanding both sides using the group operation, we get:\n$$(v + R_\\theta w, e^{i(\\theta + \\phi)}) = (w + R_\\phi v, e^{i(\\phi + \\theta)}).$$\n\nThis implies $v + R_\\theta w = w + R_\\phi v$ and $\\theta + \\phi = \\phi + \\theta$. The second equation is always satisfied, so we focus on the first equation:\n$$v + R_\\theta w = w + R_\\phi v.$$\n\nThis equation holds if and only if $v = R_\\theta v$ for all $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This means $v$ must be fixed under all rotations, i.e., $v$ must be the origin $(0, 0)$. Therefore, the center $Z(G)$ consists of the element $(0, e^{i\\theta})$ for all $\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nHence, $Z(G) = \\{(0, e^{i\\theta}) : \\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$.\n\n#### 2. Determine all closed connected normal subgroups of $G$.\n\nTo determine all closed connected normal subgroups of $G$, we need to consider the structure of $G = \\mathbb{R}^2 \\rtimes S^1$.\n\nThe connected normal subgroups of $G$ are of the form $H = \\mathbb{R}^2 \\rtimes K$, where $K$ is a connected normal subgroup of $S^1$. Since $S^1$ is a compact connected Lie group, its connected normal subgroups are precisely the closed subgroups. Therefore, the closed connected normal subgroups of $G$ are of the form $H = \\mathbb{R}^2 \\rtimes S^1'$, where $S^1' \\subseteq S^1$ is a closed subgroup of $S^1$.\n\n#### 3. Compute the commutator subgroup $[G,G]$ and identify the abelianization $G/[G,G]$ up to isomorphism.\n\nThe commutator subgroup $[G,G]$ is the subgroup generated by all commutators $[g, h] = ghg^{-1}h^{-1}$ for $g, h \\in G$. Let's compute $[G,G]$:\n\nLet $g = (v_1, e^{i\\theta_1})$ and $h = (v_2, e^{i\\theta_2})$ be elements of $G$. Then the commutator $[g, h]$ is given by:\n$$[g, h] = ghg^{-1}h^{-1} = (v_1 + R_{\\theta_1}v_2, e^{i(\\theta_1 + \\theta_2)}) \\cdot (v_1, e^{-i\\theta_1}) \\cdot (v_2, e^{-i\\theta_2}).$$\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n$$[g, h] = (R_{\\theta_1}v_2, e^{i(\\theta_1 + \\theta_2)}).$$\n\nTherefore, the commutator subgroup $[G,G]$ is generated by elements of the form $(0, e^{i\\theta})$ for all $\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe abelianization $G/[G,G]$ is the quotient group $G/[G,G]$ where the commutator subgroup $[G,G]$ is the kernel. Since $G$ is a semidirect product, the abelianization is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\times S^1 / \\{(0, e^{i\\theta}) : \\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$. This quotient identifies elements of the form $(0, e^{i\\theta})$ as the identity, so the abelianization is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nHence, $G/[G,G] \\cong \\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\n#### 4. Classify all continuous group homomorphisms (continuous characters) $\\chi:G\\to S^1$.\n\nA continuous group homomorphism $\\chi: G \\to S^1$ is completely determined by its action on the generators of $G$, i.e., $(v, e^{i\\theta})$. Let $\\chi((v, e^{i\\theta})) = e^{i\\phi}$ for some $\\phi \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nFor $\\chi$ to be a group homomorphism, we must have:\n$$\\chi((v, e^{i\\theta}) \\cdot (w, e^{i\\phi})) = \\chi((v, e^{i\\theta})) \\cdot \\chi((w, e^{i\\phi})).$$\n\nThis condition simplifies to:\n$$e^{i(\\theta + \\phi)} = e^{i\\theta} \\cdot e^{i\\phi} = e^{i(\\theta + \\phi)}.$$\n\nThis implies that $\\phi$ can take any real value, so there are uncountably many continuous group homomorphisms $\\chi: G \\to S^1$ given by $\\chi((v, e^{i\\theta})) = e^{i\\phi}$ for any $\\phi \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nTherefore, the set of all continuous group homomorphisms $\\chi: G \\to S^1$ is parameterized by $\\phi \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThis completes the solution to all parts of the question.",
        "raw_answer": "### Solution\n\n#### 1. Determine the center $Z(G)$.\n\nThe center $Z(G)$ of a group $G$ consists of elements that commute with all elements of $G$. In our case, an element $(v, e^{i\\theta})$ commutes with all elements if and only if it commutes with all elements of the form $(w, e^{i\\phi})$.\n\nLet $(v, e^{i\\theta}) \\in Z(G)$, then for all $(w, e^{i\\phi}) \\in G$:\n$$(v, e^{i\\theta}) \\cdot (w, e^{i\\phi}) = (w, e^{i\\phi}) \\cdot (v, e^{i\\theta}).$$\n\nExpanding both sides using the group operation, we get:\n$$(v + R_\\theta w, e^{i(\\theta + \\phi)}) = (w + R_\\phi v, e^{i(\\phi + \\theta)}).$$\n\nThis implies $v + R_\\theta w = w + R_\\phi v$ and $\\theta + \\phi = \\phi + \\theta$. The second equation is always satisfied, so we focus on the first equation:\n$$v + R_\\theta w = w + R_\\phi v.$$\n\nThis equation holds if and only if $v = R_\\theta v$ for all $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This means $v$ must be fixed under all rotations, i.e., $v$ must be the origin $(0, 0)$. Therefore, the center $Z(G)$ consists of the element $(0, e^{i\\theta})$ for all $\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nHence, $Z(G) = \\{(0, e^{i\\theta}) : \\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$.\n\n#### 2. Determine all closed connected normal subgroups of $G$.\n\nTo determine all closed connected normal subgroups of $G$, we need to consider the structure of $G = \\mathbb{R}^2 \\rtimes S^1$.\n\nThe connected normal subgroups of $G$ are of the form $H = \\mathbb{R}^2 \\rtimes K$, where $K$ is a connected normal subgroup of $S^1$. Since $S^1$ is a compact connected Lie group, its connected normal subgroups are precisely the closed subgroups. Therefore, the closed connected normal subgroups of $G$ are of the form $H = \\mathbb{R}^2 \\rtimes S^1'$, where $S^1' \\subseteq S^1$ is a closed subgroup of $S^1$.\n\n#### 3. Compute the commutator subgroup $[G,G]$ and identify the abelianization $G/[G,G]$ up to isomorphism.\n\nThe commutator subgroup $[G,G]$ is the subgroup generated by all commutators $[g, h] = ghg^{-1}h^{-1}$ for $g, h \\in G$. Let's compute $[G,G]$:\n\nLet $g = (v_1, e^{i\\theta_1})$ and $h = (v_2, e^{i\\theta_2})$ be elements of $G$. Then the commutator $[g, h]$ is given by:\n$$[g, h] = ghg^{-1}h^{-1} = (v_1 + R_{\\theta_1}v_2, e^{i(\\theta_1 + \\theta_2)}) \\cdot (v_1, e^{-i\\theta_1}) \\cdot (v_2, e^{-i\\theta_2}).$$\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n$$[g, h] = (R_{\\theta_1}v_2, e^{i(\\theta_1 + \\theta_2)}).$$\n\nTherefore, the commutator subgroup $[G,G]$ is generated by elements of the form $(0, e^{i\\theta})$ for all $\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe abelianization $G/[G,G]$ is the quotient group $G/[G,G]$ where the commutator subgroup $[G,G]$ is the kernel. Since $G$ is a semidirect product, the abelianization is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\times S^1 / \\{(0, e^{i\\theta}) : \\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$. This quotient identifies elements of the form $(0, e^{i\\theta})$ as the identity, so the abelianization is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nHence, $G/[G,G] \\cong \\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\n#### 4. Classify all continuous group homomorphisms (continuous characters) $\\chi:G\\to S^1$.\n\nA continuous group homomorphism $\\chi: G \\to S^1$ is completely determined by its action on the generators of $G$, i.e., $(v, e^{i\\theta})$. Let $\\chi((v, e^{i\\theta})) = e^{i\\phi}$ for some $\\phi \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nFor $\\chi$ to be a group homomorphism, we must have:\n$$\\chi((v, e^{i\\theta}) \\cdot (w, e^{i\\phi})) = \\chi((v, e^{i\\theta})) \\cdot \\chi((w, e^{i\\phi})).$$\n\nThis condition simplifies to:\n$$e^{i(\\theta + \\phi)} = e^{i\\theta} \\cdot e^{i\\phi} = e^{i(\\theta + \\phi)}.$$\n\nThis implies that $\\phi$ can take any real value, so there are uncountably many continuous group homomorphisms $\\chi: G \\to S^1$ given by $\\chi((v, e^{i\\theta})) = e^{i\\phi}$ for any $\\phi \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nTherefore, the set of all continuous group homomorphisms $\\chi: G \\to S^1$ is parameterized by $\\phi \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThis completes the solution to all parts of the question.",

In our case, $A$ is the $k$-algebra of $2\\times 2$ upper triangular matrices over $k$. \n\nTo determine $J(A)$, we first need to find all maximal left ideals of $A$. Since $A$ is a $k$-algebra, it is a ring with identity. Let's denote the identity matrix in $A$ as $I$.\n\nConsider the set of matrices of the form\n$$\nM = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & b \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $b\\in k$. This set forms a maximal left ideal of $A$ because it is the kernel of the projection map from $A$ onto the field $k$ given by taking the $(1,1)$ entry of a matrix. Any proper left ideal containing $M$ would have to contain all matrices of the form $M$ and some other matrix with a non-zero $(1,1)$ entry, which would make it the entire ring $A$. \n\nTherefore, $J(A) = M$.\n\n#### 2. Classifying all Two-Sided Ideals of $A$\n\nTo classify all two-sided ideals of $A$, we note that any two-sided ideal of $A$ must be of the form\n$$\nI = \\left\\{\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & b \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}: b\\in k\\right\\}\n$$\nor\n$$\nI = \\left\\{\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 0 & c \\end{pmatrix}: a,b,c\\in k\\right\\}\n$$\nwhere $a,b,c\\in k$. These are the only possible two-sided ideals of $A$.\n\n#### 3. Determining Simple Left $A$-Modules and their Annihilators\n\nAn $A$-module is simple if it has no non-trivial proper submodules. Let $V$ be a simple left $A$-module. Since $A$ is a $k$-algebra, $V$ is also a vector space over $k$. \n\nConsider the action of $A$ on $V$. Since $A$ consists of upper triangular matrices, the action of any matrix in $A$ on $V$ will preserve the subspace spanned by the first basis vector of $V$. Therefore, $V$ must be one-dimensional, spanned by a single basis vector $v$. \n\nLet $V = \\text{span}(v)$ be the simple left $A$-module. The action of $A$ on $V$ is given by\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 0 & c \\end{pmatrix}v = av\n$$\nfor all $a,b,c\\in k$.\n\nThe annihilator of $V$ is the set of all matrices in $A$ that send $v$ to $0$. This is precisely the set of matrices of the form\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & b \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $b\\in k$.

        "raw_answer": "### Solution\n\n#### 1. Determining the Jacobson Radical $J(A)$\n\nThe Jacobson radical $J(A)$ of a ring $A$ is defined as the intersection of all maximal left ideals of $A$. In our case, $A$ is the $k$-algebra of $2\\times 2$ upper triangular matrices over $k$. \n\nTo determine $J(A)$, we first need to find all maximal left ideals of $A$. Since $A$ is a $k$-algebra, it is a ring with identity. Let's denote the identity matrix in $A$ as $I$.\n\nConsider the set of matrices of the form\n$$\nM = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & b \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $b\\in k$. This set forms a maximal left ideal of $A$ because it is the kernel of the projection map from $A$ onto the field $k$ given by taking the $(1,1)$ entry of a matrix. Any proper left ideal containing $M$ would have to contain all matrices of the form $M$ and some other matrix with a non-zero $(1,1)$ entry, which would make it the entire ring $A$. \n\nTherefore, $J(A) = M$.\n\n#### 2. Classifying all Two-Sided Ideals of $A$\n\nTo classify all two-sided ideals of $A$, we note that any two-sided ideal of $A$ must be of the form\n$$\nI = \\left\\{\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & b \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}: b\\in k\\right\\}\n$$\nor\n$$\nI = \\left\\{\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 0 & c \\end{pmatrix}: a,b,c\\in k\\right\\}\n$$\nwhere $a,b,c\\in k$. These are the only possible two-sided ideals of $A$.\n\n#### 3. Determining Simple Left $A$-Modules and their Annihilators\n\nAn $A$-module is simple if it has no non-trivial proper submodules. Let $V$ be a simple left $A$-module. Since $A$ is a $k$-algebra, $V$ is also a vector space over $k$. \n\nConsider the action of $A$ on $V$. Since $A$ consists of upper triangular matrices, the action of any matrix in $A$ on $V$ will preserve the subspace spanned by the first basis vector of $V$. Therefore, $V$ must be one-dimensional, spanned by a single basis vector $v$. \n\nLet $V = \\text{span}(v)$ be the simple left $A$-module. The action of $A$ on $V$ is given by\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 0 & c \\end{pmatrix}v = av\n$$\nfor all $a,b,c\\in k$.\n\nThe annihilator of $V$ is the set of all matrices in $A$ that send $v$ to $0$. This is precisely the set of matrices of the form\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & b \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $b\\in k$. Therefore, the annihilator of $V$ is the maximal left ideal $M$ we found earlier.\n\nIn conclusion, the simple left $A$-modules are one-dimensional and are isomorphic to $k$ as vector spaces. The annihilator of each simple left $A$-module is the maximal left ideal $M$.",
