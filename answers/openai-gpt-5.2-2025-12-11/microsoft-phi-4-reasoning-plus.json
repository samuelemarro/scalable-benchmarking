        "answer": "To prove the existence of a nonprincipal ultrafilter $\\mathcal{U}$ on $\\omega = \\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots\\}$ using the Compactness Theorem for first-order logic, we will construct a set of first-order sentences $T$ such that every finite subset of $T$ has a model, and then show that $T$ has a model by compactness. This model will correspond to a nonprincipal ultrafilter.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Language and Sentences\n\nConsider the language of first-order logic with a single unary predicate $P$. We will construct a set of sentences $T$ in this language.\n\n1. **Basic Properties of a Filter:**\n   - $\\forall x (P(x) \\rightarrow P(x))$: Reflexivity (trivially true).\n   - $\\forall x \\forall y ((P(x) \\land P(y)) \\rightarrow P(x \\land y))$: Intersection property.\n   - $\\forall x \\forall y ((P(x) \\land x \\leq y) \\rightarrow P(y))$: Upward closure.\n\n2. **Nonprincipal Condition:**\n   - For each $n \\in \\omega$, add the sentence $\\neg P(n)$. This ensures that no single element set $\\{n\\}$ is in the filter.\n\n3. **Ultrafilter Condition:**\n   - For each $A \\subseteq \\omega$, add the sentence $\\bigvee_{a \\in A} P(a) \\lor \\bigwedge_{a \\notin A} \\neg P(a)$. This ensures that for every subset $A$, either $A$ or its complement is in the filter.\n\n### Step 2: Verify Finite Satisfiability\n\nWe need to show that every finite subset of $T$ has a model. Consider a finite subset $T_0 \\subseteq T$.\n\n- **Finite Intersection and Upward Closure:** The finite subset will only involve finitely many elements of $\\omega$. We can choose a set $U$ that includes all elements involved in the finite subset and satisfies the intersection and upward closure properties.\n\n- **Nonprincipal Condition:** Since $T_0$ is finite, it only involves finitely many $\\neg P(n)$ sentences. We can choose $U$ such that it does not include any of these finitely many elements.\n\n- **Ultrafilter Condition:** For each finite subset, there are only finitely many $\\bigvee_{a \\in A} P(a) \\lor \\bigwedge_{a \\notin A} \\neg P(a)$ sentences. We can choose $U$ to satisfy one part of each disjunction.\n\nThus, every finite subset of $T$ is satisfiable.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Compactness Theorem\n\nBy the Compactness Theorem, since every finite subset of $T$ has a model, $T$ itself has a model. Let $\\mathcal{M}$ be a model of $T$, and let $U = \\{ n \\in \\omega \\mid \\mathcal{M} \\models P(n) \\}$.\n\n### Step 4: Verify $\\mathcal{U} = U$ is a Nonprincipal Ultrafilter\n\n1. **Filter Properties:**\n   - $\\omega \\in \\mathcal{U}$: Since $\\mathcal{M}$ satisfies the upward closure property, $\\omega \\in \\mathcal{U}$.\n   - Upward Closure: If $A \\in \\mathcal{U}$ and $A \\subseteq B \\subseteq \\omega$, then $B \\in \\mathcal{U}$ by the upward closure property.\n   - Intersection: If $A, B \\in \\mathcal{U}$, then $A \\cap B \\in \\mathcal{U}$ by the intersection property.\n\n2. **Ultrafilter Property:**\n   - For every $A \\subseteq \\omega$, either $A \\in \\mathcal{U}$ or $\\omega \\setminus A \\in \\mathcal{U}$ by the ultrafilter condition.\n\n3. **Nonprincipal Property:**\n   - For every $n \\in \\omega$, $\\{n\\} \\notin \\mathcal{U}$ by the nonprincipal condition.\n\nThus, $\\mathcal{U}$ is a nonprincipal ultrafilter on $\\omega$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy constructing the set of sentences $T$ and applying the Compactness Theorem, we have shown the existence of a nonprincipal ultrafilter $\\mathcal{U}$ on $\\omega$. This completes the proof.",
