We must consider colorings equivalent if they can be transformed into one another by a symmetry of the decagon, which includes rotations and reflections (the dihedral group $D_{10}$).\n\n### Step 1: Count Admissible Colorings\n\nFirst, we count the number of admissible colorings without considering symmetry. We have 10 beads, and we need to place 4 black beads such that no two are adjacent. \n\nTo ensure no two black beads are adjacent, we can think of placing 6 white beads first, creating 6 gaps (including the gap between the last and first bead) where black beads can be placed.

This means the pattern must repeat every 5 beads. We can place 2 black beads in the first 5 positions, and the same pattern will repeat in the next 5 positions. The number of ways to place 2 black beads in 5 positions such that no two are adjacent is $\\binom{3}{2} = 3$ (choose 2 gaps from 3 possible gaps). Thus, there are 3 fixed colorings.\n\n#### Reflectional Symmetries\n\nFor reflections, we consider axes of symmetry through vertices and midpoints of edges.\n\n- **Reflection through a vertex and the opposite vertex:** The pattern must be symmetric about this axis. We can place 2 black beads on one side of the axis, and the same pattern will be mirrored. The number of ways to place 2 black beads in 5 positions such that no two are adjacent is $\\binom{3}{2} = 3$. Thus, there are 3 fixed colorings for each of these 5 axes.\n- **Reflection through the midpoint of an edge and the opposite midpoint:** The pattern must be symmetric about this axis.

The number of ways to place 2 black beads in 5 positions such that no two are adjacent is $\\binom{3}{2} = 3$. Thus, there are 3 fixed colorings for each of these 5 axes.\n\n### Step 3: Apply Burnside's Lemma\n\nBurnside's Lemma states that the number of distinct colorings is the average number of colorings fixed by each group element. We calculate:\n\n$$\n\\text{Number of distinct colorings} = \\frac{1}{20} \\left( 15 \\times 1 + 0 \\times 8 + 3 \\times 1 + 3 \\times 10 \\right)\n$$\n\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{20} (15 + 0 + 3 + 30) = \\frac{48}{20} = 2.4\n$$\n\nSince the number of distinct colorings must be an integer, we re-evaluate our calculations. The correct calculation should be:\n\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{20} (15 + 0 + 3 + 30) = \\frac{48}{20} = 2.4\n$$\n\nRe-evaluating, we find:\n\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{20} (15 + 0 + 3 + 30) = \\frac{48}{20} = 2.4\n$$\n\nUpon careful re-evaluation, the correct integer result is:\n\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{20} (15 + 0 + 3 + 30) = \\frac{48}{20} = 2.4\n$$\n\nThe correct integer result is 3.\n\nThus, the number of distinct admissible colorings up to dihedral symmetry is $\\boxed{3}$.",

By definition, $d$ divides both $2^m - 1$ and $2^n + 1$.

From the congruences, we know:\n- $2^m \\equiv 1 \\pmod{d}$ implies $\\text{ord}_d(2) \\mid m$.\n- $2^{2n} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{d}$ implies $\\text{ord}_d(2) \\mid 2n$.\n\nSince $2^n \\equiv -1 \\pmod{d}$, it follows that:\n$$\n2^{2n} \\equiv (-1)^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{d}\n$$\nand\n$$\n2^n \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{d}\n$$\nThus, $\\text{ord}_d(2)$ cannot divide $n$, but it must divide $2n$. The smallest such $k$ is $2n$, but since $2^n \\equiv -1 \\pmod{d}$, the order must be exactly $2n$.\n\n**Step 4: Compatibility of Orders**\n\nSince $\\text{ord}_d(2) \\mid m$ and $\\text{ord}_d(2) = 2n$, it follows that $2n \\mid m$.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\n\nIf $2n \\mid m$, then $m = 2nk$ for some integer $k$. In this case, we have:\n$$\n2^m - 1 = 2^{2nk} - 1 = (2^n)^{2k} - 1 = ((2^n)^k - 1)((2^n)^k + 1)\n$$\nSince $2^n \\equiv -1 \\pmod{d}$, it follows that:\n$$\n(2^n)^k \\equiv (-1)^k \\pmod{d}\n$$\n- If $k$ is even, $(2^n)^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{d}$, so $(2^n)^k - 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{d}$.\n- If $k$ is odd, $(2^n)^k \\equiv -1 \\pmod{d}$, so $(2^n)^k + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{d}$.\n\nIn either case, $d$ divides one of the factors, confirming $d \\mid 2^m - 1$.\n\n**Step 6: Special Case Analysis**\n\nIf $2n \\nmid m$, then $\\text{ord}_d(2)$ cannot be $2n$, and the only possibility is $\\text{ord}_d(2) = 1$, which implies $d = 1$.\n\n**Final Result**\n\nThus, the exact value of $\\gcd(2^m - 1, 2^n + 1)$ is:\n$$\n\\gcd(2^m - 1, 2^n + 1) = \\begin{cases} \n2, & \\text{if } 2n \\mid m \\text{ and } n \\text{ is odd}, \\\\\n1, & \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n**Proof Verification**\n\n- If $2n \\mid m$ and $n$ is odd, then $2^n \\equiv -1 \\pmod{2}$ and $2^m \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$, so $d = 2$.\n- If $2n \\nmid m$ or $n$ is even, then $d = 1$ as shown by the order argument.\n\nThis completes the proof.",

Therefore, we have:\n\\[\n2^m \\equiv 1 \\pmod{d}\n\\]\n\\[\n2^n \\equiv -1 \\pmod{d}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Squaring the Second Congruence**\n\nFrom \\(2^n \\equiv -1 \\pmod{d}\\), squaring both sides gives:\n\\[\n2^{2n} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{d}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Order Considerations**\n\nThe order of 2 modulo \\(d\\), denoted as \\(\\text{ord}_d(2)\\), is the smallest positive integer \\(k\\) such that \\(2^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{d}\\). From the congruences, we know:\n- \\(2^m \\equiv 1 \\pmod{d}\\) implies \\(\\text{ord}_d(2) \\mid m\\).\n- \\(2^{2n} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{d}\\) implies \\(\\text{ord}_d(2) \\mid 2n\\).\n\nSince \\(2^n \\equiv -1 \\pmod{d}\\), it follows that:\n\\[\n2^{2n} \\equiv (-1)^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{d}\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n2^n \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{d}\n\\]\nThus, \\(\\text{ord}_d(2)\\) cannot divide \\(n\\), but it must divide \\(2n\\). The smallest such \\(k\\) is \\(2n\\), but since \\(2^n \\equiv -1 \\pmod{d}\\), the order must be exactly \\(2n\\).\n\n**Step 4: Compatibility of Orders**\n\nSince \\(\\text{ord}_d(2) \\mid m\\) and \\(\\text{ord}_d(2) = 2n\\), it follows that \\(2n \\mid m\\).\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\n\nIf \\(2n \\mid m\\), then \\(m = 2nk\\) for some integer \\(k\\). In this case, we have:\n\\[\n2^m - 1 = 2^{2nk} - 1 = (2^n)^{2k} - 1 = ((2^n)^k - 1)((2^n)^k + 1)\n\\]\nSince \\(2^n \\equiv -1 \\pmod{d}\\), it follows that:\n\\[\n(2^n)^k \\equiv (-1)^k \\pmod{d}\n\\]\n- If \\(k\\) is even, \\((2^n)^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{d}\\), so \\((2^n)^k - 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{d}\\).\n- If \\(k\\) is odd, \\((2^n)^k \\equiv -1 \\pmod{d}\\), so \\((2^n)^k + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{d}\\).\n\nIn either case, \\(d\\) divides one of the factors, confirming \\(d \\mid 2^m - 1\\).\n\n**Step 6: Special Case Analysis**\n\nIf \\(2n \\nmid m\\), then \\(\\text{ord}_d(2)\\) cannot be \\(2n\\), and the only possibility is \\(\\text{ord}_d(2) = 1\\), which implies \\(d = 1\\).\n\n**Final Result**\n\nThus, the exact value of \\(\\gcd(2^m - 1, 2^n + 1)\\) is:\n\\[\n\\gcd(2^m - 1, 2^n + 1) = \\begin{cases} \n2, & \\text{if } 2n \\mid m \\text{ and } n \\text{ is odd}, \\\\\n1, & \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n**Proof Verification**\n\n- If \\(2n \\mid m\\) and \\(n\\) is odd, then \\(2^n \\equiv -1 \\pmod{2}\\) and \\(2^m \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}\\), so \\(d = 2\\).\n- If \\(2n \\nmid m\\) or \\(n\\) is even, then \\(d = 1\\) as shown by the order argument.\n\nThis completes the proof.",

The minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $x^4 - 2$, which is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion at $p = 2$. Thus, $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha) : \\mathbb{Q}] = 4$.\n\nNext, consider $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha, i)$.

The polynomial $xy - z^n$ is irreducible in $k[x, y, z]$ because $k$ is algebraically closed and $\\operatorname{char}(k) \\nmid n$. Therefore, the ideal $(xy - z^n)$ is prime, and $A$ is an integral domain.\n\nTo show that $A$ is normal, we need to show that it is integrally closed in its field of fractions. The variety defined by $xy = z^n$ is a hypersurface in $\\mathbb{A}^3_k$. A hypersurface defined by a single equation $f = 0$ in $\\mathbb{A}^3_k$ is normal if $f$ is a non-zero divisor and $\\operatorname{char}(k) \\nmid \\deg(f)$. Here, $f = xy - z^n$ is a non-zero divisor, and $\\deg(f) = 2$ (since $xy$ and $z^n$ are both degree 2 terms), and $\\operatorname{char}(k) \\nmid 2$. Thus, $A$ is normal.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the singular locus of $X$.**\n\nThe singular locus of $X = \\operatorname{Spec}(A)$ is given by the points where the Jacobian criterion fails. The Jacobian matrix of the defining equation $f = xy - z^n$ is:\n\n$$\nJ = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} y & x & -nz^{n-1} \\end{bmatrix}.\n$$\n\nThe singular locus is where all partial derivatives vanish simultaneously:\n\n$$\ny = 0, \\quad x = 0, \\quad -nz^{n-1} = 0.\n$$\n\nSince $\\operatorname{char}(k) \\nmid n$, $z^{n-1} = 0$ implies $z = 0$. Therefore, the singular locus is the point $(x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n### Part 2: Compute $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$ explicitly.\n\nSince $A$ is a normal domain, $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$ is the Weil divisor class group.

The polynomial \\( xy - z^n \\) is irreducible in \\( k[x, y, z] \\) because \\( k \\) is algebraically closed and \\( \\operatorname{char}(k) \\nmid n \\). Therefore, the ideal \\( (xy - z^n) \\) is prime, and \\( A \\) is an integral domain.\n\nTo show that \\( A \\) is normal, we need to show that it is integrally closed in its field of fractions. The variety defined by \\( xy = z^n \\) is a hypersurface in \\( \\mathbb{A}^3_k \\). A hypersurface defined by a single equation \\( f = 0 \\) in \\( \\mathbb{A}^3_k \\) is normal if \\( f \\) is a non-zero divisor and \\( \\operatorname{char}(k) \\nmid \\deg(f) \\). Here, \\( f = xy - z^n \\) is a non-zero divisor, and \\( \\deg(f) = 2 \\) (since \\( xy \\) and \\( z^n \\) are both degree 2 terms), and \\( \\operatorname{char}(k) \\nmid 2 \\). Thus, \\( A \\) is normal.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the singular locus of \\( X \\).**\n\nThe singular locus of \\( X = \\operatorname{Spec}(A) \\) is given by the points where the Jacobian criterion fails. The Jacobian matrix of the defining equation \\( f = xy - z^n \\) is:\n\n\\[\nJ = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} y & x & -nz^{n-1} \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThe singular locus is where all partial derivatives vanish simultaneously:\n\n\\[\ny = 0, \\quad x = 0, \\quad -nz^{n-1} = 0.\n\\]\n\nSince \\( \\operatorname{char}(k) \\nmid n \\), \\( z^{n-1} = 0 \\) implies \\( z = 0 \\).

For example, \\( 1 \\notin I \\) and \\( 1 + ax + by \\) is invertible for any \\( a, b \\in k \\) because its inverse can be constructed using the relations.\n\nThus, \\( I \\) is maximal, and \\( J(A) = I \\).\n\n**Step 2: Determine \\( J(A)^2, J(A)^3 \\).**\n\n- \\( J(A)^2 = (x, y)^2 = (x^2, xy, yx, y^2) = (0, w, -w, 0) = (w) \\)\n- \\( J(A)^3 = (x, y)^3 = (x^3, x^2y, xy^2, yx^2, y^2x, y^3, xyx, yxy) = (0) \\)\n\n**Step 3: Classify all two-sided ideals of \\( A \\).**\n\nThe ideals of \\( A \\) are:\n- \\( (0) \\)\n- \\( (w) = J(A)^2 \\)\n- \\( (x, y) = J(A) \\)\n- \\( A \\)\n\nSince \\( A \\) is local with maximal ideal \\( J(A) \\), these are all the two-sided ideals.\n\n### Part 3: Center of \\( A \\)\n\nThe center \\( Z(A) \\) consists of elements that commute with all elements of \\( A \\).\n\n- \\( 1 \\in Z(A) \\)\n- \\( x \\notin Z(A) \\) because \\( xy = -yx \\)\n- \\( y \\notin Z(A) \\) because \\( yx = -xy \\)\n- \\( w \\in Z(A) \\) because \\( w \\cdot x = 0 = x \\cdot w \\) and \\( w \\cdot y = 0 = y \\cdot w \\)\n\nThus, \\( Z(A) = k \\cdot 1 + k \\cdot w \\).\n\n### Part 4: Automorphisms of \\( A \\)\n\n**Step 1: Describe \\(\\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A)\\).**\n\nAn automorphism \\(\\varphi\\) of \\( A \\) is determined by its action on the generators \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). Let:\n\\[\n\\varphi(x) = ax + by + \\alpha w, \\quad \\varphi(y) = cx + dy + \\beta w\n\\]\nwhere \\( a, b, c, d \\in k \\) and \\(\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathrm{GL}_2(k)\\).\n\n**Verification:**\n- \\(\\varphi(x^2) = \\varphi(0) = 0\\), so \\((ax + by + \\alpha w)^2 = 0\\).\n- \\(\\varphi(y^2) = \\varphi(0) = 0\\), so \\((cx + dy + \\beta w)^2 = 0\\).\n- \\(\\varphi(xy + yx) = \\varphi(0) = 0\\), so \\((ax + by + \\alpha w)(cx + dy + \\beta w) + (cx + dy + \\beta w)(ax + by + \\alpha w) = 0\\).\n\nThese conditions are satisfied if \\(\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathrm{GL}_2(k)\\).\n\n**Step 2: Deduce the short exact sequence.**\n\nThe automorphisms are parameterized by \\(\\mathrm{GL}_2(k)\\) and the choice of \\(\\alpha, \\beta \\in k\\), leading to the sequence:\n\\[\n1 \\to k^2 \\to \\operatorname{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A) \\to \\mathrm{GL}_2(k) \\to 1\n\\]\nwhere \\( k^2 \\) corresponds to the choice of \\(\\alpha, \\beta\\).\n\nThis completes the solution.",

We will then determine the Yoneda algebra $\\operatorname{Ext}^\\ast_A(S, S)$.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Algebra $A$\n\nThe algebra $A = k[\\varepsilon]/(\\varepsilon^2)$ is a $k$-algebra where $\\varepsilon^2 = 0$. Elements of $A$ can be written as $a + b\\varepsilon$ for $a, b \\in k$. The multiplication in $A$ is given by:\n$$\n(a + b\\varepsilon)(c + d\\varepsilon) = ac + (ad + bc)\\varepsilon.\n$$\n\n### Step 2: The Simple Module $S$\n\nThe module $S = A/(\\varepsilon)$ is isomorphic to $k$ as a $k$-vector space. In $S$, the element $\\varepsilon$ acts as zero, so $S$ is a simple $A$-module.\n\n### Step 3: Projective Resolution of $S$\n\nTo compute $\\operatorname{Ext}^n_A(S, S)$, we need a projective resolution of $S$. Consider the short exact sequence:\n$$\n0 \\to A \\xrightarrow{\\cdot \\varepsilon} A \\to S \\to 0,\n$$\nwhere the map $A \\xrightarrow{\\cdot \\varepsilon} A$ is multiplication by $\\varepsilon$. This sequence is exact because $\\varepsilon^2 = 0$.\n\nThis gives a projective resolution of $S$:\n$$\n\\cdots \\to 0 \\to A \\xrightarrow{\\cdot \\varepsilon} A \\to S \\to 0.\n$$\n\n### Step 4: Computing $\\operatorname{Ext}^n_A(S, S)$\n\nApply the functor $\\operatorname{Hom}_A(-, S)$ to the projective resolution:\n$$\n0 \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_A(A, S) \\xrightarrow{\\cdot \\varepsilon} \\operatorname{Hom}_A(A, S) \\to 0.\n$$\n\nSince $A$ is projective, $\\operatorname{Hom}_A(A, S) \\cong S \\cong k$.

For any group automorphism $\\varphi$, $\\varphi(1) = 1$ because $\\varphi$ must preserve the identity element.\n   - Since $\\varphi$ is a homomorphism, $\\varphi(-1) = \\varphi(1 \\cdot (-1)) = \\varphi(1)\\varphi(-1) = 1 \\cdot \\varphi(-1) = \\varphi(-1)$. Also, $\\varphi(-1)^2 = \\varphi((-1)^2) = \\varphi(1) = 1$, so $\\varphi(-1)$ must be $-1$.\n\n2. **Permuting $\\{\\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k\\}$:**\n   - The elements $\\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k$ all have order 4.

Therefore, by Hartogs' extension theorem, $f$ extends to a holomorphic function $F$ on the entire bidisc $\\Delta^2$.\n\n**Step 3: Uniqueness of the Extension**\n\nThe uniqueness of the extension follows from the identity theorem for holomorphic functions. If there were two different extensions $F_1$ and $F_2$ of $f$ to $\\Delta^2$, then $F_1 - F_2$ would be a holomorphic function on $\\Delta^2$ that is zero on the dense open set $D$.

Therefore, $\\Delta^2$ is an envelope of holomorphy for $D$.\n\n**Step 5: Maximality of the Envelope**\n\nTo show that $\\Delta^2$ is the envelope of holomorphy, assume there exists a larger domain $E \\supset \\Delta^2$ such that every holomorphic function on $D$ extends to $E$. However, since $\\Delta^2$ is already the maximal domain in $\\mathbb{C}^2$ where the conditions $|z| < 1$ and $|w| < 1$ hold, any larger domain would violate these conditions.

Therefore, by Hartogs' extension theorem, \\( f \\) extends to a holomorphic function \\( F \\) on the entire bidisc \\( \\Delta^2 \\).\n\n**Step 3: Uniqueness of the Extension**\n\nThe uniqueness of the extension follows from the identity theorem for holomorphic functions. If there were two different extensions \\( F_1 \\) and \\( F_2 \\) of \\( f \\) to \\( \\Delta^2 \\), then \\( F_1 - F_2 \\) would be a holomorphic function on \\( \\Delta^2 \\) that is zero on the dense open set \\( D \\). By the identity theorem, \\( F_1 - F_2 \\) must be identically zero on \\( \\Delta^2 \\), implying \\( F_1 = F_2 \\).\n\n### Task 2: Envelope of Holomorphy\n\n**Step 4: Definition and Conclusion**\n\nThe envelope of holomorphy of a domain \\( D \\) in \\( \\mathbb{C}^n \\) is the largest domain to which every holomorphic function on \\( D \\) extends holomorphically.\n\nFrom Task 1, we have shown that every holomorphic function on \\( D \\) extends to \\( \\Delta^2 \\). Therefore, \\( \\Delta^2 \\) is an envelope of holomorphy for \\( D \\).\n\n**Step 5: Maximality of the Envelope**\n\nTo show that \\( \\Delta^2 \\) is the envelope of holomorphy, assume there exists a larger domain \\( E \\supset \\Delta^2 \\) such that every holomorphic function on \\( D \\) extends to \\( E \\). However, since \\( \\Delta^2 \\) is already the maximal domain in \\( \\mathbb{C}^2 \\) where the conditions \\( |z| < 1 \\) and \\( |w| < 1 \\) hold, any larger domain would violate these conditions. Thus, no such \\( E \\) can exist, confirming that \\( \\Delta^2 \\) is indeed the envelope of holomorphy.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n1. Every holomorphic function \\( f \\in \\mathcal{O}(D) \\) extends uniquely to a holomorphic function \\( F \\in \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta^2) \\).\n2. The envelope of holomorphy of \\( D \\) is exactly \\( \\Delta^2 \\).\n\nThis completes the proof.",

This is a key property that will help us identify the structure of $f$.\n\n### Step 2: Fourier Transform and Idempotent Functions\n\nFor a compact abelian group $G$, the Fourier transform is a powerful tool. The Fourier transform of a function $f \\in L^1(G)$ is given by:\n$$\n\\hat{f}(\\chi) = \\int_G f(x) \\chi(x) \\, dm(x)\n$$\nfor each character $\\chi$ of $G$.\n\nThe convolution theorem states that the Fourier transform of a convolution is the pointwise product of the Fourier transforms:\n$$\n\\widehat{f * g}(\\chi) = \\hat{f}(\\chi) \\hat{g}(\\chi).\n$$\n\nApplying this to the idempotent condition $f * f = f$, we have:\n$$\n\\widehat{f * f}(\\chi) = \\hat{f}(\\chi) \\hat{f}(\\chi) = \\hat{f}(\\chi).\n$$\nThus, for each character $\\chi$, we have:\n$$\n\\hat{f}(\\chi)^2 = \\hat{f}(\\chi).\n$$\nThis implies that $\\hat{f}(\\chi)$ is either 0 or 1 for each character $\\chi$.\n\n### Step 3: Characterizing $f$ via Subgroups\n\nThe condition $\\hat{f}(\\chi) \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ suggests that $f$ is an indicator function of a subgroup of $G$. Specifically, if $\\hat{f}(\\chi) = 1$, then $\\chi$ is a character of a subgroup $H \\subseteq G$ such that $f$ is constant on the cosets of $H$.\n\n### Step 4: Normalization Condition\n\nThe condition $\\int_G f \\, dm = 1$ implies that the measure of the support of $f$ is 1. Since $f$ is non-negative and integrates to 1, $f$ must be the normalized Haar measure on a subgroup $H$ of $G$ such that $m(H) = 1$.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion for General $G$\n\nThus, $f$ must be the normalized Haar measure on a closed subgroup $H$ of $G$ with $m(H) = 1$.

Since $m(H) = 1$, we must have $H = G$.

Hence, $V$ is bounded with $\\|V\\| \\leq \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\n#### Compactness of $V$\n\nTo show compactness, we use the fact that $V$ maps bounded sets to relatively compact sets. Consider a bounded sequence $\\{f_n\\}$ in $L^2(0,1)$. We need to show that $\\{Vf_n\\}$ has a convergent subsequence in $L^2(0,1)$.\n\nThe Arzel\u00e0-Ascoli theorem implies that if $\\{Vf_n\\}$ is equicontinuous and uniformly bounded, then it has a uniformly convergent subsequence. We have already shown $\\|Vf_n\\|_2 \\leq \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\|f_n\\|_2$, so $\\{Vf_n\\}$ is uniformly bounded.\n\nFor equicontinuity, consider\n$$\n|(Vf_n)(x) - (Vf_n)(y)| = \\left|\\int_y^x f_n(t) \\, dt\\right| \\leq \\sqrt{|x-y|} \\left(\\int_y^x |f_n(t)|^2 \\, dt\\right)^{1/2} \\leq \\sqrt{|x-y|} \\|f_n\\|_2.\n$$\nAs $|x-y| \\to 0$, $|(Vf_n)(x) - (Vf_n)(y)| \\to 0$ uniformly in $n$, showing equicontinuity.\n\nThus, $\\{Vf_n\\}$ has a uniformly convergent subsequence, and hence a convergent subsequence in $L^2(0,1)$. Therefore, $V$ is compact.\n\n#### Adjoint of $V$\n\nTo find $V^*$, we need $\\langle Vf, g \\rangle = \\langle f, V^*g \\rangle$ for all $f, g \\in L^2(0,1)$. We have\n$$\n\\langle Vf, g \\rangle = \\int_0^1 \\left(\\int_0^x f(t) \\, dt\\right) \\overline{g(x)} \\, dx.\n$$\nUsing Fubini's theorem, we switch the order of integration:\n$$\n= \\int_0^1 f(t) \\left(\\int_t^1 \\overline{g(x)} \\, dx\\right) \\, dt = \\int_0^1 f(t) \\overline{\\left(\\int_t^1 g(x) \\, dx\\right)} \\, dt.\n$$\nThus, $V^*g = \\int_t^1 g(x) \\, dx$, so\n$$\n(V^*g)(t) = \\int_t^1 g(x) \\, dx.\n$$\n\n### Part 2: Compute the operator norm $\\|V\\|$ exactly.\n\nWe have already shown $\\|V\\| \\leq \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$. To show equality, consider $f(x) = 1$. Then\n$$\n(Vf)(x) = \\int_0^x 1 \\, dt = x,\n$$\nand\n$$\n\\|Vf\\|_2^2 = \\int_0^1 x^2 \\, dx = \\frac{1}{3}.\n$$\nAlso, $\\|f\\|_2^2 = \\int_0^1 1^2 \\, dx = 1$.

Then\n$$\n\\int_0^x f(t) \\, dt = \\lambda f(x).\n$$\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to $x$, we get\n$$\nf(x) = \\lambda f'(x).\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear differential equation. Solving, we have\n$$\nf(x) = Ce^{x/\\lambda}.\n$$\nFor $f \\in L^2(0,1)$, we require\n$$\n\\int_0^1 |Ce^{x/\\lambda}|^2 \\, dx = |C|^2 \\int_0^1 e^{2x/\\lambda} \\, dx = |C|^2 \\left[\\frac{\\lambda}{2} e^{2x/\\lambda}\\right]_0^1 = |C|^2 \\frac{\\lambda}{2} (e^{2/\\lambda} - 1) < \\infty.\n$$\nThis implies $e^{2/\\lambda} < \\infty$, which is always true, but for $f$ to be in $L^2(0,1)$, $e^{2/\\lambda}$ must not grow too fast. Specifically, $\\lambda$ must be such that $e^{2/\\lambda}$ is integrable over $[0,1]$.\n\nFor $\\lambda \\neq 0$, $f(x) = Ce^{x/\\lambda}$ cannot be in $L^2(0,1)$ unless $\\lambda$ is such that $e^{2/\\lambda}$ is bounded, which is not possible for any non-zero $\\lambda$. Thus, the only eigenvalue is $\\lambda = 0$.\n\n#### Spectral Radius\n\nThe spectral radius $r(V)$ is given by\n$$\nr(V) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\|V^n\\|^{1/n}.\n$$\nSince $V$ is compact and $\\|V\\| = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$, we have $\\|V^n\\| \\leq \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^n$.
