Since all these vertices are in some finite $G_k$, let $U = \\{u_1, \\ldots, u_m\\}$ and $V = \\{v_1, \\ldots, v_n\\}$.\n\nBy construction, in $G_{k+1}$, either some vertex in $G_k$ already realizes $(U, V)$, or a new vertex $z_{U,V}$ was added that realizes $(U, V)$. Either way, $G$ contains a realizing vertex.\n\n### Step 4: Apply Compactness\n\nSince every finite subset $T_0 \\subseteq T$ has a model (the graph $G$ constructed above), by the **Compactness Theorem**, $T$ has a model.\n\n$$\\boxed{T \\text{ is consistent.}}$$\n\n---\n\n## Part 2: Existence of a Countable Model via Downward L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem\n\n### Step 1: Show any model of $T$ is infinite\n\n**Claim:** Any model of $T$ is infinite.\n\n**Proof:** Suppose $G \\models T$ has exactly $n$ vertices for some $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.

The extension axiom for $(n, 0)$ states:\n$$\\forall u_1 \\cdots \\forall u_n \\left(\\text{Distinct}(u_1, \\ldots, u_n) \\to \\exists z \\left(\\bigwedge_{i=1}^n z \\neq u_i \\land \\bigwedge_{i=1}^n E(z, u_i)\\right)\\right)$$\n\nTaking $u_1, \\ldots, u_n$ as all vertices, the antecedent holds (they are distinct). The consequent requires a vertex $z$ distinct from all $u_i$, which is impossible since $G$ has only $n$ vertices.

Hence $\\dim_k A = 4$.\n\n**Multiplication Table:**\n\nComputing all products using $x^2 = y^2 = 0$, $yx = -xy$, and $w = xy$:\n\n| $\\cdot$ | $1$ | $x$ | $y$ | $w$ |\n|---------|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| $1$     | $1$ | $x$ | $y$ | $w$ |\n| $x$     | $x$ | $0$ | $w$ | $0$ |\n| $y$     | $y$ | $-w$| $0$ | $0$ |\n| $w$     | $w$ | $0$ | $0$ | $0$ |\n\n---\n\n## Part 2: Jacobson Radical and Ideals\n\n**The Jacobson Radical:**\n\nLet $I = kx + ky + kw$ (elements with zero constant term). This is a two-sided ideal with $A/I \\cong k$.\n\nComputing powers:\n- $I^2$: Generated by products of pairs from $\\{x, y, w\\}$. These are $0, \\pm w$, so $I^2 = kw$.\n- $I^3 = I \\cdot kw = 0$ (since $xw = yw = w^2 = 0$).\n\nSince $I$ is nilpotent, $I \\subseteq J(A)$. Since $A/I \\cong k$ is simple, $I$ is maximal, so $J(A) \\subseteq I$.\n\n$$\\boxed{J(A) = kx + ky + kw, \\quad J(A)^2 = kw, \\quad J(A)^3 = 0}$$\n\nSince $A/J(A) \\cong k$ is a division ring, **$A$ is local**.\n\n**Classification of Two-Sided Ideals:**\n\nLet $I$ be a two-sided ideal.\n\n- **Case 1:** $I = 0$.\n- **Case 2:** $0 \\neq I \\subseteq J(A)^2$. Since $J(A)^2 = kw$ is 1-dimensional, $I = kw$.\n- **Case 3:** $I \\not\\subseteq J(A)^2$ but $I \\subseteq J(A)$. Then $I$ contains some $ax + by + cw$ with $(a,b) \\neq (0,0)$. Computing $y \\cdot (ax + by) = -aw$ and $x \\cdot (ax + by) = bw$ shows $w \\in I$.\n\n  The ideal $I/J(A)^2$ is a nonzero subspace of $J(A)/J(A)^2 \\cong k^2$. For each $[a:b] \\in \\mathbb{P}^1(k)$, the 2-dimensional ideal $I_{[a:b]} = k(ax + by) + kw$ is indeed a two-sided ideal (one verifies closure under multiplication).\n\n- **Case 4:** $I \\not\\subseteq J(A)$. If $a_0 + a_1x + a_2y + a_3w \\in I$ with $a_0 \\neq 0$, then multiplying by $x$ and $y$ yields $x, y \\in I$, hence $1 \\in I$, so $I = A$.\n\n**Complete list of ideals:**\n$$\\boxed{0 \\subset J(A)^2 = kw \\subset I_{[a:b]} \\subset J(A) \\subset A}$$\nwhere $I_{[a:b]} = k(ax+by) + kw$ for $[a:b] \\in \\mathbb{P}^1(k)$ gives a $\\mathbb{P}^1$-family of 2-dimensional ideals.\n\n---\n\n## Part 3: The Center $Z(A)$\n\nLet $z = \\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 x + \\alpha_2 y + \\alpha_3 w \\in Z(A)$.\n\n**Condition $zx = xz$:**\n- $zx = \\alpha_0 x + \\alpha_2 yx = \\alpha_0 x - \\alpha_2 w$\n- $xz = \\alpha_0 x + \\alpha_2 xy = \\alpha_0 x + \\alpha_2 w$\n\nThis requires $-\\alpha_2 w = \\alpha_2 w$, so $2\\alpha_2 = 0$. Since $\\text{char}(k) \\neq 2$, we get $\\alpha_2 = 0$.\n\n**Condition $zy = yz$:**\n- $zy = \\alpha_0 y + \\alpha_1 w$\n- $yz = \\alpha_0 y - \\alpha_1 w$\n\nThis requires $2\\alpha_1 = 0$, hence $\\alpha_1 = 0$.\n\nOne verifies $w$ is central: $wx = xw = wy = yw = 0$.\n\n$$\\boxed{Z(A) = k \\cdot 1 \\oplus k \\cdot w \\cong k[w]/(w^2)}$$\n\n---\n\n## Part 4: Automorphism Group\n\n**Form of automorphisms:**\n\nLet $\\varphi \\in \\text{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A)$. Write $\\varphi(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2y + a_3w$.\n\nFrom $\\varphi(x)^2 = 0$: The square equals $a_0^2 + (\\text{nilpotent terms}) = a_0^2 = 0$, so $a_0 = 0$. Similarly for $\\varphi(y)$.\n\nThus $\\varphi(x) = ax + by + \\alpha w$ and $\\varphi(y) = cx + dy + \\beta w$.\n\n**The anticommutator relation:** Computing $\\varphi(x)\\varphi(y) + \\varphi(y)\\varphi(x)$:\n$$\\varphi(x)\\varphi(y) = (ax+by)(cx+dy) = adxy + bcyx = (ad-bc)w$$\n$$\\varphi(y)\\varphi(x) = (cx+dy)(ax+by) = cbxy + dayx = (cb-da)w = -(ad-bc)w$$\nSum is $0$ automatically. So $\\varphi(w) = \\varphi(xy) = \\varphi(x)\\varphi(y) = (ad-bc)w$.\n\n**Bijectivity condition:** The restriction of $\\varphi$ to $J(A)$ has matrix (in basis $\\{x, y, w\\}$):\n$$M = \\begin{pmatrix} a & c & 0 \\\\ b & d & 0 \\\\ \\alpha & \\beta & ad-bc \\end{pmatrix}$$\nwith $\\det(M) = (ad-bc)^2$. Thus $\\varphi$ is bijective iff $\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\text{GL}_2(k)$.\n\n**The exact sequence:**\n\nDefine $\\pi: \\text{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A) \\to \\text{GL}_2(k)$ by \n$$\\pi(\\varphi) = \\begin{pmatrix} a & c \\\\ b & d \\end{pmatrix}$$\nwhere $\\varphi(x) = ax + by + \\alpha w$ and $\\varphi(y) = cx + dy + \\beta w$.\n\n**Verification that $\\pi$ is a homomorphism:** Let $\\varphi_1, \\varphi_2$ correspond to parameters $(a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i, \\alpha_i, \\beta_i)$. Direct computation shows:\n$$(\\varphi_1 \\circ \\varphi_2)(x) = (a_2a_1 + b_2c_1)x + (a_2b_1 + b_2d_1)y + (\\cdots)w$$\n$$(\\varphi_1 \\circ \\varphi_2)(y) = (c_2a_1 + d_2c_1)x + (c_2b_1 + d_2d_1)y + (\\cdots)w$$\n\nThus $\\pi(\\varphi_1 \\circ \\varphi_2)$ has $(1,1)$-entry $a_2a_1 + b_2c_1$ and $(2,1)$-entry $a_2b_1 + b_2d_1$, which matches:\n$$\\pi(\\varphi_1)\\pi(\\varphi_2) = \\begin{pmatrix} a_1 & c_1 \\\\ b_1 & d_1 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} a_2 & c_2 \\\\ b_2 & d_2 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nconfirming $\\pi$ is a group homomorphism.\n\n- **Kernel:** $\\ker(\\pi) = \\{\\varphi : a=d=1, b=c=0\\} = \\{\\varphi(x) = x + \\alpha w, \\varphi(y) = y + \\beta w\\}$. Since $(\\varphi_1 \\circ \\varphi_2)(x) = x + (\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2)w$, we have $\\ker(\\pi) \\cong (k^2, +)$.\n\n- **Surjectivity:** For any $N = \\begin{pmatrix} p & q \\\\ r & s \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\text{GL}_2(k)$, define $\\varphi$ by $\\varphi(x) = px + ry$, $\\varphi(y) = qx + sy$. Then $\\pi(\\varphi) = N$.\n\n- **Splitting:** Define $s: \\text{GL}_2(k) \\to \\text{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A)$ by\n$$s\\begin{pmatrix} p & q \\\\ r & s \\end{pmatrix}: x \\mapsto px + ry, \\quad y \\mapsto qx + sy$$\nThen $\\pi \\circ s = \\text{id}$, and direct verification shows $s(N_1)s(N_2) = s(N_1N_2)$, so $s$ is a group homomorphism.\n\n$$\\boxed{1 \\to k^2 \\to \\text{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A) \\xrightarrow{\\pi} \\text{GL}_2(k) \\to 1 \\text{ splits}}$$\n\nThe automorphism group is $\\text{Aut}_{k\\text{-alg}}(A) \\cong k^2 \\rtimes \\text{GL}_2(k)$.",

By **Tonelli's theorem** (the non-negative version of Fubini), we may interchange the sum and integral regardless of whether the result is finite or infinite:\n\n$$I = \\int_{(0,1)^2} \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{(xy)^{n-1}}{n} \\, d\\lambda^2 = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n} \\int_{(0,1)^2} (xy)^{n-1} \\, d\\lambda^2(x,y)$$\n\n## Computing Each Term\n\nFor each $n \\geq 1$, the double integral factors:\n$$\\int_{(0,1)^2} (xy)^{n-1} \\, dx\\, dy = \\left(\\int_0^1 x^{n-1} \\, dx\\right)\\left(\\int_0^1 y^{n-1} \\, dy\\right)$$\n\nEach single integral evaluates to:\n$$\\int_0^1 x^{n-1} \\, dx = \\left[\\frac{x^n}{n}\\right]_0^1 = \\frac{1}{n}$$\n\nTherefore:\n$$\\int_{(0,1)^2} (xy)^{n-1} \\, dx\\, dy = \\frac{1}{n} \\cdot \\frac{1}{n} = \\frac{1}{n^2}$$\n\n## Summing the Series\n\nSubstituting back into our expression for $I$:\n$$I = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n} \\cdot \\frac{1}{n^2} = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^3} = \\zeta(3)$$\n\n## Proving Convergence\n\nThe series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^3}$ converges by the $p$-series test (since $p = 3 > 1$).

Near the corner $(1,1)$ where $xy \\to 1^-$, the singularity $-\\log(1-xy)$ is integrable, as shown by the finiteness of our series.\n\n---\n\n## Final Answer\n\n$$\\boxed{I = \\zeta(3)}$$",

For any $\\zeta$ with $|\\zeta| = R$ and any $w$ with $|w| < 1$, observe that $(\\zeta, w) \\in D$ since $|\\zeta| = R > r$.

By standard theorems on parameter-dependent integrals, $F$ is holomorphic on $\\{|z| < R\\} \\times \\{|w| < 1\\}$.\n\nSince $R$ can be taken arbitrarily close to 1, $F$ extends to all of $\\Delta^2 = \\{|z| < 1\\} \\times \\{|w| < 1\\}$.\n\n**Step 3: Verification that $F = f$ on $D$**\n\n*Case (a): On $\\{|z| < R, |w| < s\\} \\subset D$*\n\nFor fixed $w$ with $|w| < s$, the function $g_w(z) := f(z, w)$ is holomorphic on $\\{|z| < 1\\}$ (since $(z, w) \\in D$ for all $|z| < 1$ when $|w| < s$). By the Cauchy integral formula:\n$$g_w(z) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\oint_{|\\zeta| = R} \\frac{g_w(\\zeta)}{\\zeta - z} \\, d\\zeta = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\oint_{|\\zeta| = R} \\frac{f(\\zeta, w)}{\\zeta - z} \\, d\\zeta = F(z, w)$$\n\nHence $F = f$ on $\\{|z| < R, |w| < s\\}$.\n\n*Case (b): On $\\{r < |z| < R, |w| < 1\\} \\subset D$*\n\nBoth $F$ and $f$ are holomorphic on this connected open set. They agree on the non-empty open subset $\\{r < |z| < R, |w| < s\\}$ (by Case (a)). By the **identity theorem** for holomorphic functions in several variables, $F = f$ on all of $\\{r < |z| < R, |w| < 1\\}$.\n\nSince $R < 1$ was arbitrary (with $R > r$), taking the union over all such $R$:\n- $F = f$ on $\\{|z| < 1, |w| < s\\}$\n- $F = f$ on $\\{r < |z| < 1, |w| < 1\\}$\n\nThe union of these sets equals $D$, confirming $F|_D = f$.\n\n**Step 4: Uniqueness**\n\nSuppose $F_1, F_2 \\in \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta^2)$ both extend $f$.

So $I = N$.\n\n**Lattice structure:** $\\{0\\} \\subset N \\subset I_1 \\subset A$, $\\{0\\} \\subset N \\subset I_2 \\subset A$, with $I_1 \\cap I_2 = N$ and $I_1 + I_2 = A$.\n\n---\n\n## Part 3: Simple Left $A$-Modules and Their Annihilators\n\nSince $A/J(A) \\cong k \\times k$ is semisimple with exactly two simple modules, $A$ has exactly **two simple left modules** up to isomorphism:\n\n### Simple Module $S_1$\n\n**As a vector space:** $S_1 \\cong k$\n\n**Module action:** For $\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 0 & c \\end{pmatrix} \\in A$ and $x \\in S_1 = k$:\n$$\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 0 & c \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot x = ax$$\n\n**Concrete realization:** The submodule $\\left\\{\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} : x \\in k\\right\\}$ of $k^2$, or equivalently $A/I_1$.\n\n**Annihilator:** \n$$\\text{Ann}(S_1) = \\left\\{M \\in A : ax = 0 \\text{ for all } x \\in k\\right\\} = I_1 = \\left\\{\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & b \\\\ 0 & c \\end{pmatrix} : b, c \\in k\\right\\}$$\n\n### Simple Module $S_2$\n\n**As a vector space:** $S_2 \\cong k$\n\n**Module action:** For $\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 0 & c \\end{pmatrix} \\in A$ and $y \\in S_2 = k$:\n$$\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 0 & c \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot y = cy$$\n\n**Concrete realization:** The quotient $k^2/S_1$ where the projection $(x,y)^T \\mapsto y$, or equivalently $A/I_2$.\n\n**Annihilator:**\n$$\\text{Ann}(S_2) = \\left\\{M \\in A : cy = 0 \\text{ for all } y \\in k\\right\\} = I_2 = \\left\\{\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} : a, b \\in k\\right\\}$$\n\n### Verification of Non-Isomorphism\n\n$S_1 \\not\\cong S_2$ since their annihilators differ: $\\text{Ann}(S_1) = I_1 \\neq I_2 = \\text{Ann}(S_2)$.",
