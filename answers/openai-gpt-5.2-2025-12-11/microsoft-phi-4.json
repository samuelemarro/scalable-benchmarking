        "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct admissible colorings of a necklace with 10 beads, where each coloring has exactly 4 black beads and no two black beads are adjacent. We must consider colorings equivalent if they can be transformed into one another by a symmetry of the decagon, which includes rotations and reflections (the dihedral group $D_{10}$).\n\n### Step 1: Count Admissible Colorings\n\nFirst, we count the number of admissible colorings without considering symmetry. We need to place 4 black beads on a circle of 10 beads such that no two black beads are adjacent.\n\nTo ensure no two black beads are adjacent, we can first place the 6 white beads. This creates 6 gaps between the white beads (including the gap between the last and first white bead due to the circular arrangement). We need to place 4 black beads into these 6 gaps, with at most one black bead per gap.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 4 gaps out of 6 to place the black beads is given by the binomial coefficient:\n\n$$\n\\binom{6}{4} = 15\n$$\n\nThus, there are 15 admissible colorings without considering symmetry.\n\n### Step 2: Consider Symmetries\n\nNext, we account for the symmetries of the decagon. The dihedral group $D_{10}$ has 20 elements: 10 rotations and 10 reflections.\n\n#### Rotational Symmetries\n\n- **Rotation by 0 positions (identity):** All 15 colorings are fixed.\n- **Rotation by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 positions:** No coloring is fixed because 4 black beads cannot be evenly distributed around the circle in these cases without having adjacent black beads.\n- **Rotation by 5 positions:** A coloring is fixed if it is symmetric with respect to a 180-degree rotation. This means the pattern must repeat every 5 beads. However, with 4 black beads, this is impossible because it would require 2 black beads in each half, which would force adjacency. Thus, no colorings are fixed.\n\n#### Reflectional Symmetries\n\nFor a coloring to be fixed under a reflection, it must be symmetric with respect to the axis of reflection. Consider the axes of reflection:\n\n- **Axes through a vertex and the midpoint of the opposite side:** There are 5 such axes. For a coloring to be fixed, the pattern must be symmetric about this axis. This requires 2 black beads on one side and 2 on the other, with the axis passing through a white bead. We can choose 2 out of the 5 positions on one side to place black beads, and the other side is determined. The number of ways to choose 2 positions from 5 is:\n\n  $$\n  \\binom{5}{2} = 10\n  $$\n\n  Thus, there are 10 fixed colorings for each of these 5 axes, giving $5 \\times 10 = 50$ fixed colorings.\n\n- **Axes through the midpoints of opposite sides:** There are 5 such axes. For a coloring to be fixed, the pattern must be symmetric about this axis. This requires 2 black beads on each side of the axis. We can choose 2 out of the 4 positions on one side to place black beads, and the other side is determined. The number of ways to choose 2 positions from 4 is:\n\n  $$\n  \\binom{4}{2} = 6\n  $$\n\n  Thus, there are 6 fixed colorings for each of these 5 axes, giving $5 \\times 6 = 30$ fixed colorings.\n\n### Step 3: Apply Burnside's Lemma\n\nBurnside's Lemma states that the number of distinct colorings is the average number of colorings fixed by each group element. Summing the fixed colorings:\n\n- Identity: 15 fixed\n- Rotations by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 positions: 0 fixed each\n- Rotation by 5 positions: 0 fixed\n- Reflections through vertices: 50 fixed\n- Reflections through midpoints: 30 fixed\n\nTotal fixed colorings:\n\n$$\n15 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 50 + 30 = 95\n$$\n\nThe number of distinct colorings is the average:\n\n$$\n\\frac{95}{20} = 4.75\n$$\n\nSince the number of distinct colorings must be an integer, we must have made a mistake in counting. Let's re-evaluate the reflection counts:\n\n- **Reflections through vertices:** Each axis fixes 10 colorings, but we counted 5 axes, so $5 \\times 2 = 10$ distinct colorings (since each coloring is counted twice, once for each half).\n- **Reflections through midpoints:** Each axis fixes 6 colorings, but we counted 5 axes, so $5 \\times 2 = 10$ distinct colorings.\n\nRecalculate total fixed colorings:\n\n$$\n15 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 10 + 10 = 35\n$$\n\nThe number of distinct colorings is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{35}{20} = 1.75\n$$\n\nRe-evaluate: Correct fixed counts should

        "raw_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct admissible colorings of a necklace with 10 beads, where each coloring has exactly 4 black beads and no two black beads are adjacent. We must consider colorings equivalent if they can be transformed into one another by a symmetry of the decagon, which includes rotations and reflections (the dihedral group \\(D_{10}\\)).\n\n### Step 1: Count Admissible Colorings\n\nFirst, we count the number of admissible colorings without considering symmetry. We need to place 4 black beads on a circle of 10 beads such that no two black beads are adjacent.\n\nTo ensure no two black beads are adjacent, we can first place the 6 white beads. This creates 6 gaps between the white beads (including the gap between the last and first white bead due to the circular arrangement). We need to place 4 black beads into these 6 gaps, with at most one black bead per gap.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 4 gaps out of 6 to place the black beads is given by the binomial coefficient:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{4} = 15\n\\]\n\nThus, there are 15 admissible colorings without considering symmetry.\n\n### Step 2: Consider Symmetries\n\nNext, we account for the symmetries of the decagon. The dihedral group \\(D_{10}\\) has 20 elements: 10 rotations and 10 reflections.\n\n#### Rotational Symmetries\n\n- **Rotation by 0 positions (identity):** All 15 colorings are fixed.\n- **Rotation by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 positions:** No coloring is fixed because 4 black beads cannot be evenly distributed around the circle in these cases without having adjacent black beads.\n- **Rotation by 5 positions:** A coloring is fixed if it is symmetric with respect to a 180-degree rotation. This means the pattern must repeat every 5 beads. However, with 4 black beads, this is impossible because it would require 2 black beads in each half, which would force adjacency. Thus, no colorings are fixed.\n\n#### Reflectional Symmetries\n\nFor a coloring to be fixed under a reflection, it must be symmetric with respect to the axis of reflection. Consider the axes of reflection:\n\n- **Axes through a vertex and the midpoint of the opposite side:** There are 5 such axes. For a coloring to be fixed, the pattern must be symmetric about this axis. This requires 2 black beads on one side and 2 on the other, with the axis passing through a white bead. We can choose 2 out of the 5 positions on one side to place black beads, and the other side is determined. The number of ways to choose 2 positions from 5 is:\n\n  \\[\n  \\binom{5}{2} = 10\n  \\]\n\n  Thus, there are 10 fixed colorings for each of these 5 axes, giving \\(5 \\times 10 = 50\\) fixed colorings.\n\n- **Axes through the midpoints of opposite sides:** There are 5 such axes. For a coloring to be fixed, the pattern must be symmetric about this axis. This requires 2 black beads on each side of the axis. We can choose 2 out of the 4 positions on one side to place black beads, and the other side is determined. The number of ways to choose 2 positions from 4 is:\n\n  \\[\n  \\binom{4}{2} = 6\n  \\]\n\n  Thus, there are 6 fixed colorings for each of these 5 axes, giving \\(5 \\times 6 = 30\\) fixed colorings.\n\n### Step 3: Apply Burnside's Lemma\n\nBurnside's Lemma states that the number of distinct colorings is the average number of colorings fixed by each group element. Summing the fixed colorings:\n\n- Identity: 15 fixed\n- Rotations by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 positions: 0 fixed each\n- Rotation by 5 positions: 0 fixed\n- Reflections through vertices: 50 fixed\n- Reflections through midpoints: 30 fixed\n\nTotal fixed colorings:\n\n\\[\n15 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 50 + 30 = 95\n\\]\n\nThe number of distinct colorings is the average:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{95}{20} = 4.75\n\\]\n\nSince the number of distinct colorings must be an integer, we must have made a mistake in counting. Let's re-evaluate the reflection counts:\n\n- **Reflections through vertices:** Each axis fixes 10 colorings, but we counted 5 axes, so \\(5 \\times 2 = 10\\) distinct colorings (since each coloring is counted twice, once for each half).\n- **Reflections through midpoints:** Each axis fixes 6 colorings, but we counted 5 axes, so \\(5 \\times 2 = 10\\) distinct colorings.\n\nRecalculate total fixed colorings:\n\n\\[\n15 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 10 + 10 = 35\n\\]\n\nThe number of distinct colorings is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{35}{20} = 1.75\n\\]\n\nRe-evaluate: Correct fixed counts

        "raw_answer": "To determine the number of distinct admissible colorings of a necklace with 10 beads, where each coloring has exactly 4 black beads and no two black beads are adjacent, we must consider colorings equivalent if they can be transformed into one another by a symmetry of the decagon (rotations and reflections, forming the dihedral group \\(D_{10}\\) of order 20).\n\n### Step 1: Count Admissible Colorings\n\nFirst, we count the number of admissible colorings without considering symmetry. We need to place 4 black beads on a circle of 10 beads such that no two black beads are adjacent.\n\nTo ensure no two black beads are adjacent, we can first place the 6 white beads. This creates 6 gaps between the white beads (including the gap between the last and first white bead due to the circular arrangement). We need to place 4 black beads into these 6 gaps, with at most one black bead per gap.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 4 gaps out of 6 to place the black beads is given by the binomial coefficient:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{4} = 15\n\\]\n\nThus, there are 15 admissible colorings without considering symmetry.\n\n### Step 2: Consider Symmetries\n\nNext, we account for the symmetries of the decagon. The dihedral group \\(D_{10}\\) has 20 elements: 10 rotations and 10 reflections.\n\n#### Rotational Symmetries\n\n- **Rotation by 0 positions (identity):** All 15 colorings are fixed.\n- **Rotation by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 positions:** No coloring is fixed because 4 black beads cannot be evenly distributed around the circle in these cases without having adjacent black beads.\n- **Rotation by 5 positions:** A coloring is fixed if it is symmetric with respect to a 180-degree rotation. This means the pattern must repeat every 5 beads. However, with 4 black beads, this is impossible because it would require 2 black beads in each half, which would force adjacency. Thus, no colorings are fixed.\n\n#### Reflectional Symmetries\n\nFor a coloring to be fixed under a reflection, it must be symmetric with respect to the axis of reflection. Consider the axes of reflection:\n\n- **Axes through a vertex and the midpoint of the opposite side:** There are 5 such axes. For a coloring to be fixed, the pattern must be symmetric about this axis. This requires 2 black beads on one side and 2 on the other, with the axis passing through a white bead. We can choose 2 out of the 5 positions on one side to place black beads, and the other side is determined. The number of ways to choose 2 positions from 5 is:\n\n  \\[\n  \\binom{5}{2} = 10\n  \\]\n\n  Thus, there are 10 fixed colorings for each of these 5 axes, giving \\(5 \\times 10 = 50\\) fixed colorings.\n\n- **Axes through the midpoints of opposite sides:** There are 5 such axes. For a coloring to be fixed, the pattern must be symmetric about this axis. This requires 2 black beads on each side of the axis. We can choose 2 out of the 4 positions on one side to place black beads, and the other side is determined. The number of ways to choose 2 positions from 4 is:\n\n  \\[\n  \\binom{4}{2} = 6\n  \\]\n\n  Thus, there are 6 fixed colorings for each of these 5 axes, giving \\(5 \\times 6 = 30\\) fixed colorings.\n\n### Step 3: Apply Burnside's Lemma\n\nBurnside's Lemma states that the number of distinct colorings is the average number of colorings fixed by each group element. Summing the fixed colorings:\n\n- Identity: 15 fixed\n- Rotations by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 positions: 0 fixed each\n- Rotation by 5 positions: 0 fixed\n- Reflections through vertices: 50 fixed\n- Reflections through midpoints: 30 fixed\n\nTotal fixed colorings:\n\n\\[\n15 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 50 + 30 = 95\n\\]\n\nThe number of distinct colorings is the average:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{95}{20} = 4.75\n\\]\n\nSince the number of distinct colorings must be an integer, we must have made a mistake in counting.

The polynomial $xy - z^n$ is irreducible in $k[x, y, z]$ because $k$ is algebraically closed and $\\operatorname{char}(k) \\nmid n$. Therefore, the ideal $(xy - z^n)$ is prime, and $A$ is an integral domain.\n\nTo show that $A$ is normal, we need to show that it is integrally closed in its field of fractions. The variety defined by $xy = z^n$ is a hypersurface in $\\mathbb{A}^3_k$. A hypersurface defined by a single equation $f = 0$ in $\\mathbb{A}^3_k$ is normal if $f$ is a non-zero divisor and $\\operatorname{char}(k) \\nmid \\deg(f)$. Here, $f = xy - z^n$ is a non-zero divisor, and $\\deg(f) = 2$ (since $xy$ and $z^n$ are both degree 2 terms), and $\\operatorname{char}(k) \\nmid 2$. Thus, $A$ is normal.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the singular locus of $X$.**\n\nThe singular locus of $X = \\operatorname{Spec}(A)$ is given by the points where the Jacobian criterion fails. The Jacobian matrix of the defining equation $f = xy - z^n$ is:\n\n$$\nJ = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} y & x & -nz^{n-1} \\end{bmatrix}.\n$$\n\nThe singular locus is where all partial derivatives vanish simultaneously:\n\n$$\ny = 0, \\quad x = 0, \\quad -nz^{n-1} = 0.\n$$\n\nSince $\\operatorname{char}(k) \\nmid n$, $z^{n-1} = 0$ implies $z = 0$. Therefore, the singular locus is the point $(x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n### Part 2: Compute $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$ explicitly.\n\nSince $A$ is a normal domain, $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$ is the Weil divisor class group. The singular locus consists of a single point, which is a rational double point (an $A_n$ singularity for $n \\geq 2$). The class group of a hypersurface singularity of type $A_{n-1}$ is $\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThus, $\\mathrm{Cl}(A) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n### Part 3: Determine the order of $[D]$ and show that $[D]$ generates $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the order of $[D]$.**\n\nThe divisor $D$ is defined by the prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p} = (x, z)$. The local ring at the generic point of $D$ is $A_{\\mathfrak{p}}$, and the completion of this local ring at the maximal ideal is isomorphic to the completion of $k[[x, y, z]]/(xy - z^n, x, z)$, which is $k[[y]]$. This is a regular local ring of dimension 1, so the divisor $D$ is a Cartier divisor.\n\nTo find the order of $[D]$, consider the map $\\phi: \\mathbb{A}^1_k \\to X$ given by $t \\mapsto (0, t^n, 0)$. The image of $\\phi$ is the closed subscheme defined by $x = z = 0$, which is exactly $D$. The map $\\phi$ is finite of degree $n$, so $[D]$ has order $n$ in $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$.\n\n**Step 2: Show that $[D]$ generates $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$.**\n\nSince $\\mathrm{Cl}(A) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ and $[D]$ has order $n$, $[D]$ generates $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Weil divisor class group $\\mathrm{Cl}(A)$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$, and the divisor $[D]$ generates this group.

Thus, $e^{i\\theta} = 1$.\n\nNow, $v - v = w - R_0 w = 0$ for all $w$, which is trivially true.

Then:\n\n\\[\ny'(x) = 2u(x)u'(x)\n\\]\n\\[\ny''(x) = 2(u'(x))^2 + 2u(x)u''(x)\n\\]\n\nSubstituting these into the original equation gives:\n\n\\[\n2(u'(x))^2 + 2u(x)u''(x) + (u(x))^2 = \\frac{(2u(x)u'(x))^2}{2(u(x))^2}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the right-hand side:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4(u(x))^2(u'(x))^2}{2(u(x))^2} = 2(u'(x))^2\n\\]\n\nThus, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n2(u'(x))^2 + 2u(x)u''(x) + (u(x))^2 = 2(u'(x))^2\n\\]\n\nCanceling \\( 2(u'(x))^2 \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n2u(x)u''(x) + (u(x))^2 = 0\n\\]\n\nDividing through by \\( 2u(x) \\) (assuming \\( u(x) \\neq 0 \\)):\n\n\\[\nu''(x) + \\frac{u(x)}{2} = 0\n\\]\n\nThis is a linear second-order differential equation.

If \\( \\lambda \\neq 0 \\), \\( f(x) = Ce^{x/\\lambda} \\) is not square-integrable unless \\( C = 0 \\). Thus, no non-zero \\( \\lambda \\) can be an eigenvalue.\n\nTherefore, the only point in the spectrum is \\( \\lambda = 0 \\).\n\n#### Spectral Radius of \\( V \\)\n\nThe spectral radius \\( r(V) \\) is given by:\n\\[\nr(V) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\|V^n\\|^{1/n}.\n\\]\nSince \\( V \\) is compact and \\( \\|V\\| = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\), we have \\( \\|V^n\\| \\leq \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^n \\). Thus:\n\\[\nr(V) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(\\|V^n\\|\\right)^{1/n} \\leq \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) = 0.\n\\]\nSince \\( 0 \\) is in the spectrum, \\( r(V) = 0 \\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\n1. \\( V \\) is a bounded compact operator with adjoint \\( V^*g(t) = \\int_t^1 g(x) \\, dx \\).\n2. The operator norm is \\( \\|V\\| = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\).\n3. The spectrum is \\( \\sigma(V) = \\{0\\} \\) and the spectral radius is \\( r(V) = 0 \\).",

Determine the Jacobson Radical $J(A)$.\n\nThe Jacobson radical $J(A)$ of an algebra $A$ is the intersection of all maximal left ideals of $A$.

These are matrices of the form:\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & b \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nwhere $b \\in k$.
