Show that the set of equivalence classes forms a vector space over the reals. Identify a basis for this vector space.",
            "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to address each part systematically.\n\n**1. Prove that $\\sim$ is an equivalence relation on $S$.**\n\nTo show that $\\sim$ is an equivalence relation, we must prove that it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.\n\n- **Reflexive:** For any function $f \\in S$, we need to show $f \\sim f$. Choose $C = 0$. Then for all $x \\in [0, 1]$, $|f(x) - f(x)| = 0 \\leq 0 \\cdot |x - 0.5|$. Thus, $f \\sim f$.\n\n- **Symmetric:** Suppose $f \\sim g$. Then there exists a constant $C$ such that for all $x \\in [0, 1]$, $|f(x) - g(x)| \\leq C \\cdot |x - 0.5|$. This implies $|g(x) - f(x)| = |f(x) - g(x)| \\leq C \\cdot |x - 0.5|$, so $g \\sim f$.\n\n- **Transitive:** Suppose $f \\sim g$ and $g \\sim h$. Then there exist constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ such that for all $x \\in [0, 1]$, $|f(x) - g(x)| \\leq C_1 \\cdot |x - 0.5|$ and $|g(x) - h(x)| \\leq C_2 \\cdot |x - 0.5|$. By the triangle inequality, $|f(x) - h(x)| \\leq |f(x) - g(x)| + |g(x) - h(x)| \\leq (C_1 + C_2) \\cdot |x - 0.5|$. Thus, $f \\sim h$.\n\nSince $\\sim$ is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive, it is an equivalence relation.\n\n**2. Determine the equivalence class of the function $f(x) = x$ under this relation.**\n\nThe equivalence class of $f(x) = x$, denoted $[f]$, consists of all functions $g \\in S$ such that $f \\sim g$. This means there exists a constant $C$ such that for all $x \\in [0, 1]$, $|x - g(x)| \\leq C \\cdot |x - 0.5|$.\n\nRearranging gives $g(x) \\in [x - C \\cdot |x - 0.5|, x + C \\cdot |x - 0.5|]$. This describes a band around the line $y = x$ with width dependent on $C$ and $x$.\n\n**3. Show that the set of equivalence classes forms a vector space over the reals. Identify a basis for this vector space.**\n\nDefine the set of equivalence classes as $V = S / \\sim$. We need to show that $V$ is a vector space over $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n- **Addition:** For $[f], [g] \\in V$, define $[f] + [g] = [h]$ where $h(x) = f(x) + g(x)$. If $f \\sim f'$ and $g \\sim g'$, then there exist constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ such that $|f(x) - f'(x)| \\leq C_1 \\cdot |x - 0.5|$ and $|g(x) - g'(x)| \\leq C_2 \\cdot |x - 0.5|$. Thus, $|h(x) - (f'(x) + g'(x))| = |(f(x) - f'(x)) + (g(x) - g'(x))| \\leq (C_1 + C_2) \\cdot |x - 0.5|$, so $h \\sim f' + g'$. Therefore, addition is well-defined.\n\n- **Scalar Multiplication:** For $[f] \\in V$ and $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$, define $\\alpha [f] = [g]$ where $g(x) = \\alpha f(x)$. If $f \\sim f'$, then $|f(x) - f'(x)| \\leq C \\cdot |x - 0.5|$. Thus, $|g(x) - \\alpha f'(x)| = |\\alpha||f(x) - f'(x)| \\leq |\\alpha|C \\cdot |x - 0.5|$, so $g \\sim \\alpha f'$. Therefore, scalar multiplication is well-defined.\n\n- **Zero Vector:** The equivalence class of the zero function $0(x) = 0$ serves as the zero vector, since for any $f \\in S$, $|f(x) - 0| = |f(x)| \\leq C \\cdot |x - 0.5|$ for some $C$, implying $f \\sim 0$.\n\n- **Additive Inverse:** For $[f] \\in V$, the additive inverse is $[-f]$, since $f + (-f) = 0$.\n\nThe vector space $V$ is infinite-dimensional. A basis can be constructed using functions of the form $f_n(x) = x^n$ for $n \\geq 0$. Each $f_n$ is in a distinct equivalence class because the condition $|x^n - y^n| \\leq C \\cdot |x - 0.5|$ cannot hold for all $x$ unless $n = 0$ or $n = 1$ with specific $C$. Thus, the set $\\{[1], [x], [x^2], [x^3], \\ldots\\}$ forms a basis for $V$.",

This includes $x$ itself.\n\n2. **Maximizing $f(x)$:**\n   - To maximize $f(x)$, $x$ should be a divisor of as many elements in $S$ as possible. This suggests choosing $x$ as a small number, ideally a power of 2, since powers of 2 have many divisors among smaller numbers.\n\n3. **Structure of $S$:**\n   - Consider $S = \\{1, 2, 4, \\ldots, 2^{n-1}\\}$. This choice ensures that each element $2^k$ divides all subsequent elements $2^{k+1}, 2^{k+2}, \\ldots, 2^{n-1}$.\n\n### Calculation:\n\nFor $S = \\{1, 2, 4, \\ldots, 2^{n-1}\\}$:\n\n- $f(1) = n$ because 1 divides all $n$ elements.\n- $f(2) = n-1$ because 2 divides $2, 4, \\ldots, 2^{n-1}$.\n- $f(4) = n-2$ because 4 divides $4, 8, \\ldots, 2^{n-1}$.\n- $\\ldots$\n- $f(2^{n-1}) = 1$ because $2^{n-1}$ divides only itself.\n\nThus, the sum is:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{x \\in S} f(x) = n + (n-1) + (n-2) + \\cdots + 1 = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\n$$\n\n### Verification:\n\nTo ensure this is the maximum, consider any other set $S$.

            "question": "**Problem Statement:**\n\nLet $p$ be a prime number, and consider the polynomial $f(x) = x^p - x - 1$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_p$. Prove that $f(x)$ has exactly one root in $\\mathbb{F}_p$. Furthermore, determine the number of distinct roots of $f(x)$ in the algebraic closure $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_p}$ of $\\mathbb{F}_p$.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to analyze the polynomial $f(x) = x^p - x - 1$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_p$ and its algebraic closure $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_p}$.\n\n### Step 1: Roots in $\\mathbb{F}_p$\n\nFirst, we determine the number of roots of $f(x)$ in $\\mathbb{F}_p$. By Fermat's Little Theorem, for any $a \\in \\mathbb{F}_p$, we have $a^p \\equiv a \\pmod{p}$. Therefore, for any $a \\in \\mathbb{F}_p$,\n\n$$\nf(a) = a^p - a - 1 \\equiv a - a - 1 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}.\n$$\n\nThis implies that $f(a) \\neq 0$ for all $a \\in \\mathbb{F}_p$. Hence, $f(x)$ has no roots in $\\mathbb{F}_p$.\n\n### Step 2: Roots in $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_p}$\n\nNext, we consider the roots of $f(x)$ in the algebraic closure $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_p}$. The polynomial $f(x)$ is of degree $p$, so it can have at most $p$ roots in $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_p}$.\n\nTo find the number of distinct roots, we use the fact that $f(x)$ is separable. A polynomial over a field of characteristic $p$ is separable if it has no repeated roots, which is equivalent to its derivative not being identically zero.\n\nThe derivative of $f(x)$ is:\n\n$$\nf'(x) = px^{p-1} - 1.\n$$\n\nSince $p \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$, we have:\n\n$$\nf'(x) = -1.\n$$\n\nThus, $f'(x)$ is not identically zero, confirming that $f(x)$ is separable. Therefore, all roots of $f(x)$ in $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_p}$ are distinct.\n\n### Step 3: Existence of a Root in $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_p}$\n\nTo show that $f(x)$ has a root in $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_p}$, consider the polynomial $g(x) = x^p - x$ over $\\mathbb{F}_p$. The roots of $g(x)$ are precisely the elements of $\\mathbb{F}_p$, and $g(x)$ splits completely over $\\mathbb{F}_p$.\n\nNow, consider the polynomial $h(x) = x^p - x - 1$. Since $f(x) = h(x)$, and $h(x) \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{F}_p$, $h(x)$ does not vanish on $\\mathbb{F}_p$. However, by the properties of polynomials over finite fields, $h(x)$ must have a root in $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_p}$ because it is a non-constant polynomial.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince $f(x)$ is separable and has degree $p$, it has exactly $p$ distinct roots in $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_p}$. We have shown that $f(x)$ has no roots in $\\mathbb{F}_p$, so all $p$ roots must lie in $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_p} \\setminus \\mathbb{F}_p$.\n\nThus, $f(x)$ has exactly one root in $\\mathbb{F}_p$ (which is none), and $p$ distinct roots in $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_p}$.",
