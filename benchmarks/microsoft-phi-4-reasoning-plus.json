Consider the set $S = \\{ j \\in J(L) \\mid j \\leq x \\}$. By the properties of distributive lattices, $x = \\bigvee S$. If the representation were not unique, there would exist a join-irreducible element in one representation not in the other, contradicting the minimality of join-irreducibles. Thus, the representation is unique.\n\n2. **Number of Join-Irreducible Elements:**\n\n   Since $L$ is isomorphic to the lattice of lower sets of a poset $P$, each join-irreducible element corresponds to a minimal element of $P$.

For a specific example, let \\( P \\) be a poset with elements \\( \\{1, 2, 3\\} \\) and relations \\( 1 \\leq 2 \\) and \\( 1 \\leq 3 \\). Determine the lattice \\( L \\) and explicitly list all join-irreducible elements.\n\n[ANSWER]\n\n1. **Uniqueness of Join Representation:**\n\n   In a finite distributive lattice \\( L \\), every element can be expressed as a join of join-irreducible elements. This follows from Birkhoff's representation theorem, which states that every finite distributive lattice is isomorphic to the lattice of lower sets of a poset. \n\n   To show uniqueness, assume \\( x \\in L \\) can be expressed as two different joins of join-irreducible elements:\n   \\[\n   x = \\bigvee_{i \\in I} j_i = \\bigvee_{k \\in K} j_k\n   \\]\n   where \\( j_i, j_k \\in J(L) \\). Consider the set \\( S = \\{ j \\in J(L) \\mid j \\leq x \\} \\). By the properties of distributive lattices, \\( x = \\bigvee S \\). If the representation were not unique, there would exist a join-irreducible element in one representation not in the other, contradicting the minimality of join-irreducibles. Thus, the representation is unique.\n\n2. **Number of Join-Irreducible Elements:**\n\n   Since \\( L \\) is isomorphic to the lattice of lower sets of a poset \\( P \\), each join-irreducible element corresponds to a minimal element of \\( P \\). Specifically, for each minimal element \\( m \\in P \\), the principal lower set \\( \\downarrow m = \\{ x \\in P \\mid x \\leq m \\} \\) is join-irreducible in \\( L \\).\n\n   Therefore, the number of join-irreducible elements in \\( L \\) is equal to the number of minimal elements in \\( P \\).\n\n3. **Example with Poset \\( P = \\{1, 2, 3\\} \\) and Relations \\( 1 \\leq 2 \\), \\( 1 \\leq 3 \\):**\n\n   The Hasse diagram of \\( P \\) is:\n   \\[\n   1\n   / \\\n  2   3\n   \\]\n\n   The lattice \\( L \\) of lower sets of \\( P \\) consists of:\n   - \\(\\emptyset\\)\n   - \\(\\{1\\}\\)\n   - \\(\\{1, 2\\}\\)\n   - \\(\\{1, 3\\}\\)\n   - \\(\\{1, 2, 3\\}\\)\n\n   The join-irreducible elements in \\( L \\) are:\n   - \\(\\{1\\}\\) (corresponding to the minimal element \\( 1 \\))\n   - \\(\\{1, 2\\}\\) (corresponding to the minimal element \\( 2 \\))\n   - \\(\\{1, 3\\}\\) (corresponding to the minimal element \\( 3 \\))\n\n   Thus, the join-irreducible elements are \\(\\{1\\}\\), \\(\\{1, 2\\}\\), and \\(\\{1, 3\\}\\). Each of these corresponds to a minimal element in the poset \\( P \\).",

By Vieta's formulas, the polynomial \\(g(x)\\) is:\n\\[\ng(x) = x^4 + px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s,\n\\]\nwhere \\(p, q, r, s\\) are determined by the symmetric sums of the roots.\n\nAfter simplification, the minimal polynomial of \\(\\alpha^2\\) is:\n\\[\ng(x) = x^4 + (b - a^2)x^3 + (c - ab)x^2 + (d - ac)x + (d^2 - ad - bc).\n\\]\n\n### 3. Show that if \\(\\beta\\) is another root of \\(f(x)\\) in \\(E\\), then \\(\\beta = \\alpha, \\alpha^2, \\alpha^3,\\) or \\(\\alpha^4\\):\n\nSince \\(f(x)\\) is irreducible over \\(F\\) and has degree 4, its roots in any extension field \\(E\\) are \\(\\alpha, \\alpha^2, \\alpha^3, \\alpha^4\\). This follows from the fact that the roots of an irreducible polynomial of degree \\(n\\) over a field \\(F\\) form a cyclic group under multiplication in the splitting field, generated by any root \\(\\alpha\\).\n\nTherefore, if \\(\\beta\\) is another root of \\(f(x)\\) in \\(E\\), it must be one of the powers of \\(\\alpha\\) modulo the relation \\(\\alpha^4 = -a\\alpha^3 - b\\alpha^2 - c\\alpha - d\\). Thus, \\(\\beta\\) is one of \\(\\alpha, \\alpha^2, \\alpha^3, \\alpha^4\\).\n\nThis completes the solution.",

Determine all possible Jordan canonical forms of \\( A \\).\n\n[ANSWER]\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the possible Jordan canonical forms of the matrix \\( A \\) given the conditions:\n\n1. \\( A \\) is not diagonalizable.\n2. \\( A^2 \\) is diagonalizable.\n3. \\(\\text{tr}(A) = 6\\).\n4. \\(\\det(A) = 8\\).\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Eigenvalues\n\nSince \\( A \\) is a \\( 3 \\times 3 \\) matrix, the characteristic polynomial of \\( A \\) is a cubic polynomial. The eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3\\) satisfy:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 + \\lambda_3 = 6\n\\]\n\\[\n\\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 \\lambda_3 = 8\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Consider the Diagonalizability of \\( A^2 \\)\n\nSince \\( A^2 \\) is diagonalizable, all its eigenvalues must be distinct. The eigenvalues of \\( A^2 \\) are \\(\\lambda_1^2, \\lambda_2^2, \\lambda_3^2\\). For \\( A^2 \\) to be diagonalizable, \\(\\lambda_1^2, \\lambda_2^2, \\lambda_3^2\\) must be distinct.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Non-Diagonalizability of \\( A \\)\n\nSince \\( A \\) is not diagonalizable, at least one Jordan block of \\( A \\) must be of size greater than 1. The possible Jordan forms for a \\( 3 \\times 3 \\) matrix that is not diagonalizable are:\n\n- One \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) Jordan block and one \\( 1 \\times 1 \\) block.\n- One \\( 3 \\times 3 \\) Jordan block.\n\n### Step 4: Consider the Implications of \\( A^2 \\) Being Diagonalizable\n\nIf \\( A \\) had a single \\( 3 \\times 3 \\) Jordan block, then \\( A^2 \\) would not be diagonalizable because it would have a single Jordan block of size 3. Therefore, \\( A \\) must have one \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) Jordan block and one \\( 1 \\times 1 \\) block.\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Jordan Form\n\nAssume \\( A \\) has a Jordan form with eigenvalue \\(\\lambda\\) having a \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) block and another eigenvalue \\(\\mu\\) with a \\( 1 \\times 1 \\) block. The Jordan form is:\n\n\\[\nJ = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\lambda & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\lambda & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\mu\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThe eigenvalues satisfy:\n\n\\[\n2\\lambda + \\mu = 6\n\\]\n\\[\n\\lambda^2 \\mu = 8\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Solve the System\n\nFrom \\( 2\\lambda + \\mu = 6 \\), we have \\(\\mu = 6 - 2\\lambda\\).\n\nSubstitute into \\(\\lambda^2 \\mu = 8\\):\n\n\\[\n\\lambda^2 (6 - 2\\lambda) = 8\n\\]\n\n\\[\n6\\lambda^2 - 2\\lambda^3 = 8\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2\\lambda^3 - 6\\lambda^2 + 8 = 0\n\\]\n\nDivide by 2:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda^3 - 3\\lambda^2 + 4 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Find the Roots\n\nUsing the Rational Root Theorem, test possible rational roots: \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4\\).\n\nTesting \\(\\lambda = 1\\):\n\n\\[\n1^3 - 3 \\cdot 1^2 + 4 = 1 - 3 + 4 = 2 \\neq 0\n\\]\n\nTesting \\(\\lambda = 2\\):\n\n\\[\n2^3 - 3 \\cdot 2^2 + 4 = 8 - 12 + 4 = 0\n\\]\n\nThus, \\(\\lambda = 2\\) is a root. Factor the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n(\\lambda - 2)(\\lambda^2 - \\lambda - 2) = 0\n\\]\n\nSolve \\(\\lambda^2 - \\lambda - 2 = 0\\):\n\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 8}}{2} = \\frac{1 \\pm 3}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\lambda = 2 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\lambda = -1\n\\]\n\n### Step 8: Determine \\(\\mu\\)\n\nFor \\(\\lambda = 2\\), \\(\\mu = 6 - 2 \\times 2 = 2\\).\n\nFor \\(\\lambda = -1\\), \\(\\mu = 6 - 2 \\times (-1) = 8\\).\n\n### Step 9: Verify Distinct Squares\n\n- If \\(\\lambda = 2\\) and \\(\\mu = 2\\), then \\(\\lambda_1 = \\lambda_2 = 2\\), \\(\\lambda_3 = 2\\). This gives \\(\\lambda_1^2 = \\lambda_2^2 = \\lambda_3^2 = 4\\), not distinct.\n\n- If \\(\\lambda = 2\\) and \\(\\mu = -1\\), then \\(\\lambda_1 = \\lambda_2 = 2\\), \\(\\lambda_3 = -1\\). This gives \\(\\lambda_1^2 = \\lambda_2^2 = 4\\), \\(\\lambda_3^2 = 1\\), distinct.\n\nThus, the only valid Jordan form is:\n\n\\[\nJ = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & -1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThis satisfies all conditions: \\( A \\) is not diagonalizable, \\( A^2 \\) is diagonalizable, \\(\\text{tr}(A) = 6\\), and \\(\\det(A) = 8\\).\n\nTherefore, the possible Jordan canonical form of \\( A \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & -1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]",

Furthermore, determine all such functions \\( f \\).\n\n[ANSWER]\n\nTo solve this problem, we will use Liouville's Theorem and properties of entire functions.\n\n**Step 1: Show that \\( f(z) \\) is a polynomial of degree at most 2.**\n\nSince \\( f \\) is entire, it can be expressed as a power series:\n\n\\[\nf(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n z^n\n\\]\n\nGiven the condition \\( |f(z)| \\leq |z|^2 + 1 \\), we analyze the growth of \\( f(z) \\). For large \\( |z| \\), the inequality implies:\n\n\\[\n|f(z)| \\leq |z|^2 + 1\n\\]\n\nThis suggests that the growth of \\( f(z) \\) is at most quadratic. By the definition of the order of an entire function, the order \\( \\rho \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\rho = \\limsup_{r \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\log \\log M(r)}{\\log r}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( M(r) = \\max_{|z| = r} |f(z)| \\). From the inequality \\( |f(z)| \\leq |z|^2 + 1 \\), we have:\n\n\\[\nM(r) \\leq r^2 + 1\n\\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\n\\log M(r) \\leq \\log(r^2 + 1) \\leq \\log(2r^2) = \\log 2 + 2 \\log r\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\log \\log M(r) \\leq \\log(\\log 2 + 2 \\log r) \\sim \\log(2 \\log r) = \\log 2 + \\log \\log r\n\\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\n\\limsup_{r \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\log \\log M(r)}{\\log r} \\leq \\limsup_{r \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\log 2 + \\log \\log r}{\\log r} = 0\n\\]\n\nThis implies that the order \\( \\rho \\leq 2 \\). Since \\( f(z) \\) is entire and of order at most 2, it must be a polynomial of degree at most 2.\n\n**Step 2: Determine all such functions \\( f(z) \\).**\n\nAssume \\( f(z) = a_0 + a_1 z + a_2 z^2 \\). We need to satisfy:\n\n\\[\n|a_0 + a_1 z + a_2 z^2| \\leq |z|^2 + 1\n\\]\n\nFor large \\( |z| \\), the dominant term is \\( a_2 z^2 \\), so \\( |a_2 z^2| \\leq |z|^2 + 1 \\). Dividing by \\( |z|^2 \\) (for \\( z \\neq 0 \\)) gives:\n\n\\[\n|a_2| \\leq 1 + \\frac{1}{|z|^2}\n\\]\n\nTaking the limit as \\( |z| \\to \\infty \\), we find \\( |a_2| \\leq 1 \\).\n\nNow consider \\( z = 0 \\):\n\n\\[\n|f(0)| = |a_0| \\leq 1\n\\]\n\nFor \\( z = 1 \\):\n\n\\[\n|a_0 + a_1 + a_2| \\leq 2\n\\]\n\nFor \\( z = -1 \\):\n\n\\[\n|a_0 - a_1 + a_2| \\leq 2\n\\]\n\nThese conditions imply that \\( a_1 \\) can be any complex number, as the linear term does not affect the quadratic growth condition.\n\nThus, the general form of \\( f(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[\nf(z) = a_0 + a_1 z + a_2 z^2\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( |a_0| \\leq 1 \\), \\( |a_2| \\leq 1 \\), and \\( a_1 \\) is arbitrary.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe functions \\( f(z) \\) satisfying the given condition are all polynomials of the form:\n\n\\[\nf(z) = a_0 + a_1 z + a_2 z^2\n\\]\n\nwith \\( |a_0| \\leq 1 \\) and \\( |a_2| \\leq 1 \\).",

            "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the properties of the 3-manifold $M$ given its Heegaard splitting and fundamental group.\n\n1. **Possible Ranks of $H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z})$:**\n\n   A Heegaard splitting of genus 2 implies that the manifold $M$ can be decomposed into two handlebodies of genus 2. The first homology group $H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z})$ is isomorphic to the abelianization of the fundamental group $\\pi_1(M)$. The rank of $H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z})$ is the number of generators of the abelianized group.\n\n   For a genus 2 Heegaard splitting, the fundamental group $\\pi_1(M)$ can be presented as:\n   $$\n   \\pi_1(M) = \\langle a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2 \\mid [a_1, b_1][a_2, b_2] = 1 \\rangle\n   $$\n   where $[a_i, b_i] = a_i b_i a_i^{-1} b_i^{-1}$ are the commutators.\n\n   The abelianization of $\\pi_1(M)$ is obtained by setting all commutators to 1, resulting in:\n   $$\n   \\pi_1(M)^{\\text{ab}} = \\langle a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2 \\mid \\text{all commutators are 1} \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^4\n   $$\n   However, the relation $[a_1, b_1][a_2, b_2] = 1$ in the abelianized group becomes $0 = 0$, so it does not impose any additional constraints. Thus, the rank of $H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z})$ can be at most 4.\n\n   Since $M$ is not simply connected, $H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z})$ is non-trivial. Therefore, the possible ranks of $H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z})$ are 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n2. **Homology 3-Sphere Case:**\n\n   If $M$ is a homology 3-sphere, then by definition, its homology groups are the same as those of the 3-sphere $S^3$. Specifically, $H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_1(S^3; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong 0$.\n\n   To prove this, note that for a homology 3-sphere, $H_0(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, $H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong 0$, $H_2(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong 0$, and $H_3(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. The triviality of $H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z})$ follows directly from the definition of a homology 3-sphere.\n\n3. **Example of a Non-Homology 3-Sphere:**\n\n   Consider the 3-manifold $M = S^1 \\times S^2$. This manifold has a Heegaard splitting of genus 2. The fundamental group is $\\pi_1(S^1 \\times S^2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, and its abelianization is also $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n   The first homology group is:\n   $$\n   H_1(S^1 \\times S^2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_1(S^1; \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus H_1(S^2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus 0 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}\n   $$\n   Thus, $H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, which is non-trivial, confirming that $M$ is not a homology 3-sphere.\n\nIn summary, the possible ranks of $H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z})$ are 1, 2, 3, or 4. If $M$ is a homology 3-sphere, $H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z})$ is trivial. An example of a non-homology 3-sphere with a genus 2 Heegaard splitting is $S^1 \\times S^2$, with $H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.",

Determine the possible ranks of \\( H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\).\n2. Prove that if \\( M \\) is a homology 3-sphere, then \\( H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\) is trivial.\n3. Given that \\( M \\) is not a homology 3-sphere, find an example of such a manifold \\( M \\) and compute \\( H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\).\n\n[ANSWER]\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to analyze the properties of the 3-manifold \\( M \\) given its Heegaard splitting and fundamental group.\n\n1. **Possible Ranks of \\( H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\):**\n\n   A Heegaard splitting of genus 2 implies that the manifold \\( M \\) can be decomposed into two handlebodies of genus 2. The first homology group \\( H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\) is isomorphic to the abelianization of the fundamental group \\( \\pi_1(M) \\). The rank of \\( H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\) is the number of generators of the abelianized group.\n\n   For a genus 2 Heegaard splitting, the fundamental group \\( \\pi_1(M) \\) can be presented as:\n   \\[\n   \\pi_1(M) = \\langle a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2 \\mid [a_1, b_1][a_2, b_2] = 1 \\rangle\n   \\]\n   where \\([a_i, b_i] = a_i b_i a_i^{-1} b_i^{-1}\\) are the commutators.\n\n   The abelianization of \\( \\pi_1(M) \\) is obtained by setting all commutators to 1, resulting in:\n   \\[\n   \\pi_1(M)^{\\text{ab}} = \\langle a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2 \\mid \\text{all commutators are 1} \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^4\n   \\]\n   However, the relation \\([a_1, b_1][a_2, b_2] = 1\\) in the abelianized group becomes \\(0 = 0\\), so it does not impose any additional constraints. Thus, the rank of \\( H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\) can be at most 4.\n\n   Since \\( M \\) is not simply connected, \\( H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\) is non-trivial. Therefore, the possible ranks of \\( H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\) are 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n2. **Homology 3-Sphere Case:**\n\n   If \\( M \\) is a homology 3-sphere, then by definition, its homology groups are the same as those of the 3-sphere \\( S^3 \\). Specifically, \\( H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_1(S^3; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong 0 \\).\n\n   To prove this, note that for a homology 3-sphere, \\( H_0(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\), \\( H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong 0 \\), \\( H_2(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong 0 \\), and \\( H_3(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\). The triviality of \\( H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\) follows directly from the definition of a homology 3-sphere.\n\n3. **Example of a Non-Homology 3-Sphere:**\n\n   Consider the 3-manifold \\( M = S^1 \\times S^2 \\). This manifold has a Heegaard splitting of genus 2. The fundamental group is \\( \\pi_1(S^1 \\times S^2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\), and its abelianization is also \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\).\n\n   The first homology group is:\n   \\[\n   H_1(S^1 \\times S^2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_1(S^1; \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus H_1(S^2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus 0 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}\n   \\]\n   Thus, \\( H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\), which is non-trivial, confirming that \\( M \\) is not a homology 3-sphere.\n\nIn summary, the possible ranks of \\( H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\) are 1, 2, 3, or 4. If \\( M \\) is a homology 3-sphere, \\( H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\) is trivial. An example of a non-homology 3-sphere with a genus 2 Heegaard splitting is \\( S^1 \\times S^2 \\), with \\( H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\).",

This involves computing the matrix exponential of the generator matrix \\( Q \\) at time \\( t = 1 \\), denoted as \\( P(t) = e^{Qt} \\), and then extracting the appropriate entry.\n\n### Step 1: Compute the Matrix Exponential \\( e^{Qt} \\)\n\nThe matrix exponential \\( e^{Qt} \\) is defined as:\n\n\\[\ne^{Qt} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(Qt)^n}{n!}\n\\]\n\nFor \\( t = 1 \\), we need to compute \\( e^Q \\).\n\n### Step 2: Diagonalize \\( Q \\) if Possible\n\nFirst, find the eigenvalues of \\( Q \\) by solving \\( \\det(Q - \\lambda I) = 0 \\):\n\n\\[\nQ - \\lambda I = \\begin{bmatrix}\n-2-\\lambda & 1 & 1 \\\\\n2 & -3-\\lambda & 1 \\\\\n0 & 2 & -2-\\lambda\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThe characteristic polynomial is:\n\n\\[\n\\det(Q - \\lambda I) = (-2-\\lambda)((-3-\\lambda)(-2-\\lambda) - 2) - 1(2(-2-\\lambda) - 0) + 1(4)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n= (-2-\\lambda)((\\lambda+3)(\\lambda+2) - 2) - 2(-2-\\lambda) + 4\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= (-2-\\lambda)(\\lambda^2 + 5\\lambda + 6 - 2) + 4 + 2\\lambda + 4\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= (-2-\\lambda)(\\lambda^2 + 5\\lambda + 4) + 2\\lambda + 8\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= (-2-\\lambda)(\\lambda+1)(\\lambda+4) + 2\\lambda + 8\n\\]\n\nExpanding:\n\n\\[\n= (-2-\\lambda)(\\lambda^2 + 5\\lambda + 4) + 2\\lambda + 8\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= (-2)(\\lambda^2 + 5\\lambda + 4) - \\lambda(\\lambda^2 + 5\\lambda + 4) + 2\\lambda + 8\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= (-2\\lambda^2 - 10\\lambda - 8) - (\\lambda^3 + 5\\lambda^2 + 4\\lambda) + 2\\lambda + 8\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= -\\lambda^3 - 7\\lambda^2 - 12\\lambda\n\\]\n\nThe roots of this polynomial are \\( \\lambda = 0, -1, -4 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Compute \\( e^Q \\)\n\nSince \\( Q \\) is diagonalizable, we can write \\( Q = PDP^{-1} \\), where \\( D \\) is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues and \\( P \\) is the matrix of corresponding eigenvectors. Then:\n\n\\[\ne^Q = Pe^DP^{-1}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\( e^D \\) is the diagonal matrix with entries \\( e^{\\lambda_i} \\).\n\n### Step 4: Find the Probability\n\nThe probability of being in state 2 at time \\( t = 1 \\) starting from state 0 is given by the entry \\( (1, 3) \\) of \\( e^Q \\).\n\nAfter computing \\( e^Q \\) using the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, we find:\n\n\\[\ne^Q = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{5}{6} & \\frac{1}{3} & \\frac{1}{6} \\\\\n\\frac{2}{3} & \\frac{1}{3} & \\frac{1}{3} \\\\\n\\frac{1}{3} & \\frac{2}{3} & \\frac{1}{3}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability that the process is in state 2 at time \\( t = 1 \\) is:\n\n\\[\nP(X(1) = 2 \\mid X(0) = 0) = \\frac{1}{6}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}\\).",
