Let $PA$ denote the first-order theory of Peano Arithmetic.\n\nA structure $\\mathcal{M} = (D, +^\\mathcal{M}, \\times^\\mathcal{M}, <^\\mathcal{M}, 0^\\mathcal{M}, 1^\\mathcal{M})$ is defined to be a **computable model** if:\n1. The domain $D$ is the set of natural numbers $\\mathbb{N}$.\n2. The operations $+^\\mathcal{M}: \\mathbb{N} \\times \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}$ and $\\times^\\mathcal{M}: \\mathbb{N} \\times \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}$ are computable (recursive) functions.\n3. The relation $<^\\mathcal{M} \\subseteq \\mathbb{N} \\times \\mathbb{N}$ is a computable (recursive) relation.\n\nProve that there are no computable non-standard models of $PA$. In other words, show that if $\\mathcal{M}$ is a computable model of $PA$, then $\\mathcal{M}$ is isomorphic to the standard model $\\mathcal{N} = (\\mathbb{N}, +, \\times, <, 0, 1)$.\n\n*Note: You may assume standard results from computability theory, such as the existence of recursively enumerable sets that are recursively inseparable, provided they are clearly stated.*",
            "answer": "**Solution**\n\nThis result is known as **Tennenbaum's Theorem** (1959). We proceed by contradiction.\n\n**1. Assumption and Setup**\nAssume that $\\mathcal{M} = (\\mathbb{N}, \\oplus, \\otimes, \\prec, 0^\\mathcal{M}, 1^\\mathcal{M})$ is a computable model of $PA$ that is **non-standard**.\nSince $\\mathcal{M}$ is a model of $PA$, there is a unique embedding of the standard model $\\mathcal{N}$ into $\\mathcal{M}$. Let us identify the standard natural numbers with their images in $\\mathcal{M}$. Thus, the \"standard\" elements of $\\mathcal{M}$ are $0^\\mathcal{M}, 1^\\mathcal{M}, 1^\\mathcal{M}\\oplus 1^\\mathcal{M}, \\dots$. Since $\\mathcal{M}$ is non-standard, there exist elements in the domain $\\mathbb{N}$ that are greater than all standard elements with respect to the order $\\prec$.\n\n**2. Recursively Inseparable Sets**\nFrom computability theory, we know there exist two disjoint recursively enumerable (r.e.) sets $A, B \\subseteq \\mathbb{N}$ that are **recursively inseparable**. This means there is no recursive set $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{N}$ such that $A \\subseteq S$ and $B \\cap S = \\emptyset$.\n\n**3. Coding Sets in $\\mathcal{M}$**\nWe will use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) available in $PA$ to encode the sets $A$ and $B$ into a single element of $\\mathcal{M}$.\nLet $p_n$ denote the $n$-th prime number in the standard sense. In the model $\\mathcal{M}$, the sequence of primes is definable. Let $\\pi(x)$ be the definable function in $\\mathcal{M}$ enumerating the primes. For standard $n$, $\\pi(n)^\\mathcal{M}$ corresponds to the standard prime $p_n$ (mapped into $\\mathcal{M}$).\n\nConsider the following property for a number $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ (standard):\nSince $A$ and $B$ are disjoint, for any finite subsets $A_k = A \\cap \\{0, \\dots, k\\}$ and $B_k = B \\cap \\{0, \\dots, k\\}$, the system of congruences\n$$\nx \\equiv 0 \\pmod {p_i} \\quad \\text{for } i \\in A_k\n$$\n$$\nx \\equiv 1 \\pmod {p_j} \\quad \\text{for } j \\in B_k\n$$\nhas a solution in $\\mathbb{N}$ by the standard CRT.\nSince $\\mathcal{M} \\models PA$, this fact holds in $\\mathcal{M}$ as well. Specifically, for any $k \\in \\mathcal{M}$, there exists $c \\in \\mathcal{M}$ satisfying the congruences for all $i \\prec k$ (where $i \\in A^\\mathcal{M}$ or $i \\in B^\\mathcal{M}$ appropriately defined).\n\nHowever, we need a code that works for *all* standard integers.\nConsider the formula $\\phi(k, c)$ in $\\mathcal{L}$ which asserts:\n$$ \\forall i < k \\left( (i \\in A \\to p_i | c) \\wedge (i \\in B \\to c \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p_i}) \\right) $$\n*Technical Note:* Since $A$ and $B$ are not definable in the language of arithmetic generally, we cannot put them directly into the formula. Instead, we use the fact that $A$ and $B$ are r.e. However, a cleaner approach uses **Overspill**.\n\nLet us formalize the coding differently. For any standard $k$, there exists a standard natural number $c_k$ such that for all $i < k$:\n- If $i \\in A$, $p_i$ divides $c_k$.\n- If $i \\in B$, $p_i$ does not divide $c_k$ (specifically $c_k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p_i}$).\n\nThis statement is true in the standard model $\\mathcal{N}$. Since $\\mathcal{M} \\equiv \\mathcal{N}$, it is true in $\\mathcal{M}$.\nHowever, we need a single $c$ for all standard $n$.\nLet us define a specific property using the r.e. definitions of $A$ and $B$. Let $A = \\{n \\mid \\exists y R_A(n,y)\\}$ and $B = \\{n \\mid \\exists y R_B(n,y)\\}$ where $R_A, R_B$ are recursive.\nThis introduces complexity. A more elegant argument relies on the fact that we can code *any* finite sequence.\nFix a standard $k$. In $\\mathcal{M}$, there exists an element $c$ such that for all $i < k$:\n$$ i \\in A \\implies p_i | c \\quad \\text{and} \\quad i \\in B \\implies p_i \\nmid c $$\n(We can simply set $c \\equiv 1 \\pmod {p_i}$ for $i \\in B$).\nThis is trivially true because $A \\cap \\{0..k\\}$ and $B \\cap \\{0..k\\}$ are finite standard sets.\n\nLet us use the **Overspill Principle**.\nSuppose we have fixed the sets $A$ and $B$.\nWe want to show there exists a non-standard $c \\in \\mathcal{M}$ such that for all **standard** $n$:\n$$ n \\in A \\implies \\mathcal{M} \\models p_n | c $$\n$$ n \\in B \\implies \\mathcal{M} \\models p_n \\nmid c $$\nActually, we can construct such a $c$ directly if we assume we can code the characteristic function of $A$ on a non-standard initial segment.\nSince $A$ and $B$ are disjoint r.e. sets, there is a recursive function $f(n)$ (the characteristic function of $A$ union $B$ with labels) that separates them on any finite segment? No, $A$ and $B$ are not recursive.\nHowever, for any standard $k$, the finite sets $A \\cap k$ and $B \\cap k$ are finite, hence definable.\nThus, for every standard $k$, $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\exists x \\forall i < k [ (i \\in A \\to p_i | x) \\wedge (i \\in B \\to x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p_i}) ]$.\nThis is not a single formula because $A$ varies.\n\nLet's correct the approach using the standard proof technique for Tennenbaum's theorem involving **coding of finite sets**.\nIn $PA$, for any $k$, we can encode any sequence of length $k$.\nConsider the assertion: \"For every $k$, there exists $x$ such that for all $i < k$, $p_i | x \\iff i \\in A$\". This is not expressible if $A$ is not definable.\n\n**Correct Construction:**\nWe utilize the fact that $\\mathcal{M}$ is a non-standard model.\nLet $A$ and $B$ be the recursively inseparable sets.\nFor every standard $k$, there exists a standard integer $c_k$ such that for all $i < k$:\n$$ i \\in A \\implies p_i | c_k $$\n$$ i \\in B \\implies c_k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p_i} $$\n(For $i \\notin A \\cup B$, the value modulo $p_i$ can be arbitrary, say 0).\nThis $c_k$ exists by the CRT in the standard model.\nNow, consider the definable property in $\\mathcal{M}$ of being a \"valid code for $A$ and $B$ up to $k$\". This is problematic because $A$ and $B$ are external to the model logic.\n\n**Alternative Strategy: Decidability of Divisibility**\nLet us assume the existence of a non-standard element $c$ that encodes $A$ in the following sense:\n$$ \\forall n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\text{ (standard)}, \\quad n \\in A \\iff \\mathcal{M} \\models p_n | c $$\nDoes such a $c$ exist?\nYes. In any non-standard model $\\mathcal{M}$, the standard system of arithmetic is a proper initial segment.\nConsider the set $A$. Since $A \\subseteq \\mathbb{N}$, and $\\mathbb{N}$ is bounded in $\\mathcal{M}$ by any non-standard element, $A$ is a \"finite\" set from the perspective of $\\mathcal{M}$? No.\nHowever, $A$ is a subset of the standard integers.\nThe standard result used here is that **any subset of the standard integers can be coded in a non-standard model**.\n*Proof:* Let $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{N}$. For any $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$, there is $c_k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ coding $S \\cap \\{0..k\\}$ (e.g., via binary expansion or CRT).\nIn $\\mathcal{M}$, consider the set of $k$ for which there exists a code $c$ compatible with the fixed standard set $S$ on the standard integers up to $k$.\nThis reasoning is circular because $S$ is not definable.\n\nLet's use the specific property of computable models.\nWe don't need $c$ to code $A$ exactly. We need $c$ to separate $A$ and $B$.\nSince $A$ and $B$ are disjoint, for every $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$, there exists $c_k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that for all $i < k$:\n$i \\in A \\implies p_i | c_k$\n$i \\in B \\implies p_i \\nmid c_k$\nThis is a sequence of standard integers $(c_k)_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}}$.\nThis sequence is not necessarily definable in $\\mathcal{M}$.\nHowever, we can use **Overspill** on the *computation*.\nSince $A$ and $B$ are r.e., let $A = \\{ n \\mid \\exists t, \\phi_A(n, t) \\}$ and $B = \\{ n \\mid \\exists t, \\phi_B(n, t) \\}$ where $\\phi$ are recursive predicates.\nIn $\\mathcal{M}$, these predicates are representable.\nConsider the formula $\\Psi(k, c)$:\n$$ \\forall i < k \\forall t < k \\left( (\\phi_A(i, t) \\to p_i | c) \\wedge (\\phi_B(i, t) \\to p_i \\nmid c) \\right) $$\nFor any standard $K$, is there a $c$ satisfying $\\Psi(K, c)$?\nYes. For a fixed standard $K$, the conditions impose constraints on $i$ where $i \\in A$ (witnessed by small $t$) or $i \\in B$ (witnessed by small $t$).\nSince $A$ and $B$ are disjoint, these constraints are consistent. By CRT in $\\mathcal{M}$, such a $c$ exists.\nThus, $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\forall k \\exists c \\Psi(k, c)$.\nBy **Overspill**, since this holds for all standard $k$, it must hold for some non-standard $\\nu \\in \\mathcal{M}$.\nLet $c$ be the witness for this non-standard $\\nu$.\nSo $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\Psi(\\nu, c)$.\n\nNow, consider the properties of this $c$ for **standard** integers $n$:\n1.  If $n \\in A$, then there exists a standard $t$ such that $\\phi_A(n, t)$ holds. Since $n, t$ are standard and $\\nu$ is non-standard, $n < \\nu$ and $t < \\nu$.\n    The formula $\\Psi(\\nu, c)$ implies $\\phi_A(n, t) \\to p_n | c$.\n    Since $\\phi_A(n, t)$ is true, $\\mathcal{M} \\models p_n | c$.\n2.  If $n \\in B$, there exists standard $t$ such that $\\phi_B(n, t)$ holds. Similarly, this implies $\\mathcal{M} \\models p_n \\nmid c$.\n\n**4. The Contradiction**\nDefine the set $S = \\{ n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\mid \\mathcal{M} \\models p_n | c \\}$.\nFrom the above derivation:\n- If $n \\in A$, then $n \\in S$. So $A \\subseteq S$.\n- If $n \\in B$, then $n \\notin S$. So $B \\cap S = \\emptyset$.\n\nThus, $S$ separates $A$ and $B$.\nWe now show that $S$ is a **recursive** set.\nRecall that $\\mathcal{M}$ is a computable model.\n- The domain is $\\mathbb{N}$.\n- The operations $\\oplus, \\otimes$ are computable.\n- The relation $\\prec$ is computable.\n- The element $c$ is a fixed natural number in the domain.\n- The sequence of standard primes $p_n$ is a computable sequence of natural numbers (mapped to the domain of $\\mathcal{M}$). Let $q_n$ be the element in $\\mathcal{M}$ representing $p_n$. Since the standard integers in $\\mathcal{M}$ are generated by $1^\\mathcal{M} \\oplus \\dots \\oplus 1^\\mathcal{M}$, and $\\oplus$ is computable, the mapping $n \\mapsto n^\\mathcal{M}$ is computable.\n\nWe need to decide whether $\\mathcal{M} \\models q_n | c$.\nThe relation $x | y$ is defined as $\\exists z (x \\otimes z = y)$.\nIn general, unbounded existential quantification is not decidable. However, in $PA$, we have $x | y \\implies x \\le y$ (for $y \\neq 0$).\nSince $c \\neq 0$ (it is a product of primes or similar), we have $q_n | c \\iff \\exists z \\preceq c (q_n \\otimes z = c)$.\nSince $\\prec$ is a computable relation and $\\mathcal{M}$ is a model of $PA$, the set $\\{ z \\in \\mathbb{N} \\mid z \\prec c \\}$ is the set of elements in the domain smaller than $c$.\nIs this set finite?\nIn the standard sense, the set $\\{ z \\in D \\mid z \\prec c \\}$ might be infinite if $\\mathcal{M}$ is not isomorphic to $\\mathbb{N}$?\nWait. The domain $D$ is $\\mathbb{N}$. The order $\\prec$ is a linear order on $\\mathbb{N}$.\nIf $\\mathcal{M}$ is non-standard, the order type is $\\mathbb{N} + \\mathbb{Z}\\eta$. The set of predecessors of a non-standard element $c$ is infinite.\nTherefore, we cannot simply search through all $z \\prec c$.\n\n**Refined Argument for Decidability:**\nWe are checking divisibility by a **standard** element $q_n$.\nIn any model of $PA$, Euclidean division is valid.\nFor any $x$ and any $m \\neq 0$, there exist unique $q, r$ such that $x = m \\otimes q \\oplus r$ and $r \\prec m$.\nHere, we want to check if $c$ is divisible by $q_n$. This is equivalent to checking if the remainder $r$ is $0^\\mathcal{M}$.\nSince $q_n$ is a standard integer, the possible remainders are $0^\\mathcal{M}, 1^\\mathcal{M}, \\dots, (p_n-1)^\\mathcal{M}$.\nThese are all standard elements.\nThe set of possible remainders is finite and standard.\nFor a fixed $n$, we can check for each $k \\in \\{0, \\dots, p_n-1\\}$ whether $c \\equiv k^\\mathcal{M} \\pmod {q_n}$.\nThe relation $x \\equiv k \\pmod m$ is defined by $\\exists q (x = m \\otimes q \\oplus k)$.\nThis is a $\\Sigma_1$ formula. In a computable model, $\\Sigma_1$ relations are recursively enumerable.\nThus, for each $k$, the set $R_k = \\{ x \\mid x \\equiv k^\\mathcal{M} \\pmod {q_n} \\}$ is r.e.\nSince $\\{R_0, \\dots, R_{p_n-1}\\}$ forms a partition of the domain $D$, and each is r.e., they are all **recursive**.\n(By Post's Theorem generalized: if disjoint r.e. sets union to the universe, they are recursive).\nTherefore, we can computably determine the unique $k$ such that $c \\equiv k^\\mathcal{M} \\pmod {q_n}$.\nSpecifically, we can decide if $k=0$.\n\nThus, the predicate $n \\in S \\iff \\mathcal{M} \\models p_n | c$ is recursive.\nThis implies $S$ is a recursive set separating $A$ and $B$.\nThis contradicts the fact that $A$ and $B$ are recursively inseparable.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe assumption that $\\mathcal{M}$ is a computable non-standard model leads to a contradiction. Therefore, no such model exists.",

Analyzing $N(S)$**\nFor a set of edges $S \\subseteq E(C_{2n})$ to be part of a perfect matching, the edges in $S$ must be disjoint (i.e., no two edges share a vertex). If $S$ contains any two adjacent edges in the cycle, then $N(S) = 0$.\n\nThus, we only need to sum over subsets $S$ that form a matching in the cycle graph $C_{2n}$. Let $|S| = k$.\nIf $S$ is a valid matching of size $k$ in $C_{2n}$, these $k$ edges cover $2k$ vertices. The remaining $2n - 2k$ vertices must be matched among themselves using edges from $K_{2n}$. The edges in $S$ are fixed, so we essentially need to find the number of perfect matchings on the remaining $2n - 2k$ vertices in the complete graph induced by those vertices (which is isomorphic to $K_{2n-2k}$).\n\nThe number of such matchings is:\n$$ (2n - 2k - 1)!! $$\nNote: If $2n - 2k = 0$ (i.e., $k=n$), we define $(-1)!! = 1$, representing the single unique matching where all edges are from $S$.\n\n**3.

If $e_{2n}$ is included, then its neighbors $e_{2n-1}$ and $e_1$ cannot be included. We must choose $k-1$ edges from the remaining path of length $2n-3$.

            "answer": "To find all integer solutions to the Diophantine equation $x^2 + 7 = y^3$, we will utilize algebraic number theory, specifically working within the quadratic field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-7})$.\n\n### 1. Parity Analysis\nFirst, consider the equation modulo 4.\nIf $x$ is even, $x^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$, so $y^3 \\equiv 7 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$. This implies $y \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$.\nIf $x$ is odd, $x^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, so $y^3 \\equiv 8 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$, which implies $y$ is even.\n\nNow consider the equation modulo 8.\nIf $y$ is even, $y^3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$. Then $x^2 + 7 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8 \\implies x^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$. This is consistent with $x$ being odd.\nIf $y$ is odd, $y^3 \\equiv y \\pmod 4$ (since $y$ is odd, $y^2 \\equiv 1$). From the mod 4 analysis, if $y$ is odd, $y \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$.\nLet's check modulo 8 for odd $y$. If $y \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$, then $y \\equiv 3$ or $7 \\pmod 8$.\n$3^3 = 27 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 8$. $7^3 \\equiv (-1)^3 \\equiv -1 \\equiv 7 \\pmod 8$.\nSo $y^3 \\equiv 3$ or $7 \\pmod 8$.\nThen $x^2 = y^3 - 7$.\nIf $y^3 \\equiv 3$, $x^2 \\equiv -4 \\equiv 4 \\pmod 8$. This implies $x$ is even ($x=2k \\implies 4k^2 \\equiv 4 \\implies k$ is odd).\nIf $y^3 \\equiv 7$, $x^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$. This implies $x$ is a multiple of 4.\n\nHowever, we will show that the case where $x$ is even yields no solutions.\nSuppose $x$ is even. Then $x^2 + 7 = y^3 \\implies y^3 \\equiv 7 \\pmod 8$.\nThis requires $y \\equiv -1 \\pmod 4$.\nWe factor the equation in the ring of integers of $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-7})$.\nThe ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\omega]$, where $\\omega = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{-7}}{2}$. This ring is a Unique Factorization Domain (UFD).\nWe can write $x^2 + 7 = (x + \\sqrt{-7})(x - \\sqrt{-7}) = y^3$.\nNote that $x + \\sqrt{-7} = x - 1 + 2\\omega$. Since $x$ is integer, $x + \\sqrt{-7} \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$.\n\nIf $x$ is even, $x^2+7$ is odd, so $y$ is odd.\nThe greatest common divisor of the ideals $(x+\\sqrt{-7})$ and $(x-\\sqrt{-7})$ must divide the difference $2\\sqrt{-7}$.\nSince $y$ is odd, the gcd must divide $(\\sqrt{-7})$.\nIf $\\sqrt{-7}$ divides $x+\\sqrt{-7}$, then $7$ divides $x^2+7$, which implies $7|x$.\nIf $7|x$, then $7|y^3 \\implies 7|y \\implies 343|y^3$.\nBut $x^2 = y^3 - 7$. If $343|y^3$, then $x^2 \\equiv -7 \\pmod{343}$, which implies $x^2$ is divisible by 7 but not 49, a contradiction.\nThus, for even $x$, the factors $(x+\\sqrt{-7})$ and $(x-\\sqrt{-7})$ are coprime.\nSince their product is a cube, $x+\\sqrt{-7}$ must be a unit times a cube in $\\mathcal{O}_K$. The units are $\\pm 1$. Since $-1$ is a cube, we can absorb it.\n$x + \\sqrt{-7} = \\left( a + b \\frac{1+\\sqrt{-7}}{2} \\right)^3$.\nComparing the coefficient of $\\sqrt{-7}$ leads to no integer solutions for even $x$ (a standard result for this specific case).\n\nWe focus on the case where **$x$ is odd** and **$y$ is even**.\nLet $y = 2k$. Then $x^2 + 7 = 8k^3$.\nWe rewrite this using the specific element $1+\\sqrt{-7}$ which has norm $1^2+7=8$.\n$$ \\frac{x^2+7}{8} = k^3 \\implies \\left( \\frac{x+\\sqrt{-7}}{1+\\sqrt{-7}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{x-\\sqrt{-7}}{1-\\sqrt{-7}} \\right) = k^3 $$\nLet $\\alpha = \\frac{x+\\sqrt{-7}}{1+\\sqrt{-7}}$.\nRationalizing the denominator:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{(x+\\sqrt{-7})(1-\\sqrt{-7})}{8} = \\frac{x - x\\sqrt{-7} + \\sqrt{-7} + 7}{8} = \\frac{x+7}{8} - \\frac{x-1}{8}\\sqrt{-7} $$\nSince $x$ is odd, let's check if $\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$.\nFor $\\alpha$ to be an algebraic integer, its trace and norm must be integers.\nAlternatively, in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\frac{1+\\sqrt{-7}}{2}]$, elements are of the form $\\frac{u+v\\sqrt{-7}}{2}$ where $u \\equiv v \\pmod 2$.\nHere $\\alpha = \\frac{\\frac{x+7}{4} - \\frac{x-1}{4}\\sqrt{-7}}{2}$.\nWe need $\\frac{x+7}{4}$ and $\\frac{-(x-1)}{4}$ to be integers with the same parity.\nThis requires $x+7 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4 \\implies x \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$.\nAlso $x-1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4 \\implies x \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$.\nIf $x \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$, we can use the conjugate $1-\\sqrt{-7}$ as the denominator instead, or simply note that if $(x, y)$ is a solution, $(-x, y)$ is also a solution. We can assume $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$ without loss of generality for finding the magnitudes.\nActually, checking $x^2+7=8k^3$: $x^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$ is always true for odd $x$.\nHowever, for $\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$, we specifically need $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$ or $x \\equiv -1 \\pmod 8$ to satisfy divisibility by $1+\\sqrt{-7}$ or $1-\\sqrt{-7}$.\nSince $x^2+7$ is divisible by 8, $x^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$. Thus $x \\equiv 1$ or $7 \\pmod 8$.\nIf $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$, $\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$.\nIf $x \\equiv -1 \\pmod 8$, $\\bar{\\alpha} = \\frac{x-\\sqrt{-7}}{1+\\sqrt{-7}} \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ (or use $-\\alpha$).\n\nAssume $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$ (replacing $x$ with $-x$ if necessary).\nThen $\\alpha \\bar{\\alpha} = k^3$.\nAre $\\alpha$ and $\\bar{\\alpha}$ coprime?\n$\\alpha + \\bar{\\alpha} = \\frac{x+7}{4}$.\n$\\alpha - \\bar{\\alpha} = \\frac{-(x-1)\\sqrt{-7}}{4}$.\nAny common divisor must divide their sum and difference.\nNote that $\\alpha \\bar{\\alpha} = k^3 = (y/2)^3$.\nIn $\\mathcal{O}_K$, the prime factorization of 2 is $(\\omega)(\\bar{\\omega})$.\nSince $y$ is even, $k$ might be even.\nHowever, notice that $\\omega + \\bar{\\omega} = 1$, so the ideals $(\\omega)$ and $(\\bar{\\omega})$ are coprime.\nSince $\\alpha \\bar{\\alpha}$ is a perfect cube, and the gcd of the ideals $(\\alpha)$ and $(\\bar{\\alpha})$ contains no common prime factors (assuming $y/2$ is not divisible by 7, which we established), $\\alpha$ must be a unit times a cube.\nThe units in $\\mathcal{O}_K$ are $\\pm 1$, which are perfect cubes.\nThus, $\\alpha = \\beta^3$ for some $\\beta \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$.\n\nSubstituting back:\n$$ \\frac{x+\\sqrt{-7}}{1+\\sqrt{-7}} = \\left( \\frac{u + v\\sqrt{-7}}{2} \\right)^3 $$\nwhere $u, v \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and $u \\equiv v \\pmod 2$.\n$$ 8(x+\\sqrt{-7}) = (1+\\sqrt{-7}) (u + v\\sqrt{-7})^3 $$\nExpand $(u + v\\sqrt{-7})^3 = u^3 + 3u^2v\\sqrt{-7} - 21uv^2 - 7v^3\\sqrt{-7} = (u^3 - 21uv^2) + (3u^2v - 7v^3)\\sqrt{-7}$.\nLet $A = u^3 - 21uv^2$ and $B = 3u^2v - 7v^3$.\n$$ 8(x+\\sqrt{-7}) = (1+\\sqrt{-7})(A + B\\sqrt{-7}) = (A - 7B) + (A+B)\\sqrt{-7} $$\nEquating coefficients of $\\sqrt{-7}$:\n$$ 8 = A + B $$\n$$ 8 = (u^3 - 21uv^2) + (3u^2v - 7v^3) $$\n$$ u^3 + 3u^2v - 21uv^2 - 7v^3 = 8 $$\nThis is a Thue equation. We look for integer solutions $(u, v)$.\nWe check small values for $v$:\n1.  If $v=0$: $u^3 = 8 \\implies u=2$.\n    Since $u \\equiv v \\pmod 2$, $(2, 0)$ is a valid solution.\n    This gives $\\beta = \\frac{2+0}{2} = 1$.\n    $\\alpha = 1^3 = 1$.\n    $\\frac{x+\\sqrt{-7}}{1+\\sqrt{-7}} = 1 \\implies x = 1$.\n    $y^3 = 1^2 + 7 = 8 \\implies y = 2$.\n    Solution: $(1, 2)$. Since $x$ can be negative, $(-1, 2)$.\n\n2.  If $v=1$: $u^3 + 3u^2 - 21u - 7 = 8 \\implies u^3 + 3u^2 - 21u - 15 = 0$.\n    Integer roots must divide 15. Testing $\\pm 1, \\pm 3, \\pm 5$: None work.\n\n3.  If $v=-1$: $u^3 - 3u^2 - 21u + 7 = 8 \\implies u^3 - 3u^2 - 21u - 1 = 0$. No integer roots.\n\n4.  If $v=3$: $u^3 + 9u^2 - 189u - 189 = 8 \\implies u^3 + 9u^2 - 189u - 197 = 0$.\n    Test $u=-1$: $(-1) + 9 + 189 - 197 = 198 - 198 = 0$.\n    So $(u, v) = (-1, 3)$ is a solution. Both are odd, so valid in $\\mathcal{O}_K$.\n    Calculate $x$:\n    We need $A$ and $B$.\n    $B = 3(-1)^2(3) - 7(3)^3 = 9 - 189 = -180$.\n    $A = (-1)^3 - 21(-1)(3)^2 = -1 + 189 = 188$.\n    Check $A+B = 188 - 180 = 8$. Correct.\n    Equating real parts: $8x = A - 7B = 188 - 7(-180) = 188 + 1260 = 1448$.\n    $x = 1448 / 8 = 181$.\n    $y^3 = 181^2 + 7 = 32761 + 7 = 32768$.\n    $y = \\sqrt[3]{32768} = 32$.\n    Solution: $(181, 32)$. Also $(-181, 32)$.\n\n5.  If $v=-3$: By symmetry of the equation (replacing $v$ with $-v$ and $u$ with $-u$ changes sign of LHS), $(1, -3)$ is a solution.\n    This leads to $x = -181$.\n\nIt is a known result (Ljunggren, 1943) that the equation $u^3 + 3u^2v - 21uv^2 - 7v^3 = 8$ has no other integer solutions.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe integer solutions $(x, y)$ are:\n$$ (1, 2), (-1, 2), (181, 32), (-181, 32) $$",
