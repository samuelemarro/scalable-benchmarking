The problem should be well-posed, clear, non-trivial, and solvable with established mathematical methods.\n\n## Step 2: Identify a suitable topic within algebraic geometry\nAlgebraic geometry is a broad field that involves the study of geometric objects, such as varieties and schemes, using tools from abstract algebra. A suitable topic could involve the study of curves, surfaces, or higher-dimensional varieties, and their properties.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a specific problem\nLet's consider a problem involving the intersection of curves on a surface. A classic result in algebraic geometry is B\u00e9zout's theorem, which describes the intersection of two curves on a projective plane. We can formulate a problem related to this.\n\n## Step 4: State the problem\nConsider two curves $C_1$ and $C_2$ on $\\mathbb{P}^2$, defined by homogeneous polynomials $f(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 - z^2$ and $g(x,y,z) = xy - z^2$, respectively. Find the number of intersection points of $C_1$ and $C_2$ in $\\mathbb{P}^2$, counted with multiplicity.\n\n## Step 5: Provide the solution\nTo find the intersection points, we need to solve the system of equations given by $f(x,y,z) = 0$ and $g(x,y,z) = 0$. This means we have to solve $x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = 0$ and $xy - z^2 = 0$ simultaneously.\n\n## Step 6: Solve the system of equations\nFirst, from $xy - z^2 = 0$, we can express $z^2 = xy$. Substituting $z^2$ into the first equation gives $x^2 + y^2 - xy = 0$. This is a homogeneous equation in $x$ and $y$, which can be solved by considering it as a quadratic form.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze the quadratic form\nThe equation $x^2 - xy + y^2 = 0$ can be analyzed by finding its roots. This is equivalent to solving $x^2 - xy + y^2 = 0$ for $x$ in terms of $y$ (or vice versa), treating it as a quadratic equation.\n\n## Step 8: Solve for $x$ in terms of $y$\nUsing the quadratic formula, $x = \\frac{y \\pm \\sqrt{y^2 - 4y^2}}{2} = \\frac{y \\pm \\sqrt{-3y^2}}{2}$. For $y \\neq 0$, this simplifies to $x = \\frac{y(1 \\pm i\\sqrt{3})}{2}$.

The problem should be well-posed, clear, non-trivial, and solvable with established mathematical methods.\n\n## Step 2: Identify a suitable topic within algebraic geometry\nAlgebraic geometry is a broad field that involves the study of geometric objects, such as varieties and schemes, using tools from abstract algebra. A suitable topic could involve the study of curves, surfaces, or higher-dimensional varieties, and their properties.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a specific problem\nLet's consider a problem involving the intersection of curves on a surface. A classic result in algebraic geometry is B\u00e9zout's theorem, which describes the intersection of two curves on a projective plane. We can formulate a problem related to this.\n\n## Step 4: State the problem\nConsider two curves $C_1$ and $C_2$ on $\\mathbb{P}^2$, defined by homogeneous polynomials $f(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 - z^2$ and $g(x,y,z) = xy - z^2$, respectively. Find the number of intersection points of $C_1$ and $C_2$ in $\\mathbb{P}^2$, counted with multiplicity.\n\n## Step 5: Provide the solution\nTo find the intersection points, we need to solve the system of equations given by $f(x,y,z) = 0$ and $g(x,y,z) = 0$. This means we have to solve $x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = 0$ and $xy - z^2 = 0$ simultaneously.\n\n## Step 6: Solve the system of equations\nFirst, from $xy - z^2 = 0$, we can express $z^2 = xy$. Substituting $z^2$ into the first equation gives $x^2 + y^2 - xy = 0$. This is a homogeneous equation in $x$ and $y$, which can be solved by considering it as a quadratic form.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze the quadratic form\nThe equation $x^2 - xy + y^2 = 0$ can be analyzed by finding its roots. This is equivalent to solving $x^2 - xy + y^2 = 0$ for $x$ in terms of $y$ (or vice versa), treating it as a quadratic equation.\n\n## Step 8: Solve for $x$ in terms of $y$\nUsing the quadratic formula, $x = \\frac{y \\pm \\sqrt{y^2 - 4y^2}}{2} = \\frac{y \\pm \\sqrt{-3y^2}}{2}$. For $y \\neq 0$, this simplifies to $x = \\frac{y(1 \\pm i\\sqrt{3})}{2}$.

This implies $z = \\pm y\\sqrt{\\omega}$ and $z = \\pm y\\sqrt{\\omega^2}$.

For $S^2$, we know that $K^0(S^2)$ is related to the isomorphism classes of complex vector bundles on $S^2$, and $K^1(S^2)$ is related to the stable homotopy group $\\pi_1(S^2)$.\n\n## Step 7: Write down the problem and its solution\n### Problem\nCompute $K^0(S^2)$ and $K^1(S^2)$.\n\n### Solution\n$K^0(S^2)$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$ because $S^2$ is a compact, connected manifold, and the rank of $K^0(S^2)$ is related to the number of connected components. $K^1(S^2)$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$ as well, due to the Bott periodicity and the fact that $K^1(S^2) \\cong \\tilde{K}^0(S^2) \\oplus K^1(\\text{pt})$, but here it directly relates to $\\mathbb{Z}$ due to the nature of $S^2$ being a sphere.\n\nFor $S^2$, we have that $K^0(S^2) = \\mathbb{Z}$ and $K^1(S^2) = 0$ due to the properties of complex K-theory.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$ for $K^1(S^2)$ and $\\boxed{\\mathbb{Z}}$ for $K^0(S^2)$.\n\n## Step 8: Verify the solution fits the required format\nThe solution provided is a direct computation and explanation related to the K-theory of $S^2$, fitting the request for a challenging problem in K-theory.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0} \\text{ and } \\mathbb{Z}$",

If $f'(0) = 0$, then $f(x) = 0$ for all $x$, which is indeed a solution.\n\n## Step 11: Formulate the final problem and solution.\nLet's formulate the problem: \"Find all $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy $f(x + y) = \\frac{f(x) + f(y)}{1 - f(x)f(y)}$ for all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\"\n\n[QUESTION]\nFind all $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy $f(x + y) = \\frac{f(x) + f(y)}{1 - f(x)f(y)}$ for all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n[ANSWER]\nThe solution to the functional equation is $f(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, because for any other $f'(0)$, $f(x) = \\tan(f'(0)x)$ is not defined for all $x$. Thus, the only solution that is defined for all real numbers is $f(x) = 0$.",

The boundary data is $f(y) = \\log|y - (1,0)| = \\log\\sqrt{2 - 2\\cos\\phi}$. So, $u(x) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{1 - r^2}{r^2 - 2r\\cos(\\theta - \\phi) + 1} \\log\\sqrt{2 - 2\\cos\\phi} d\\phi$.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the integral\nThe integral can be simplified by recognizing that $\\log\\sqrt{2 - 2\\cos\\phi} = \\log|1 - e^{i\\phi}| = \\log|1 - e^{i\\phi}| = \\Re(\\log(1 - e^{i\\phi}))$. However, directly evaluating this integral is complex and typically involves recognizing it as a special case that can be related to the properties of harmonic functions and the Poisson kernel.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluate the solution using properties of harmonic functions\nFor $x \\in D$, the solution can be found by directly applying properties of harmonic functions and recognizing that the given boundary condition corresponds to a specific harmonic function. The function $u(x) = \\log|x - (1,0)|$ is harmonic in $D$ except at $x = (1,0)$, which is outside $D$ since $|1,0| = 1$ is on $\\partial D$. Thus, we directly check if $u(x)$ satisfies the given boundary condition and is harmonic.\n\n## Step 9: Check if the given boundary data directly provides the solution\nSince $\\log|x - (1,0)|$ is harmonic in $D$ and equals $\\log|y - (1,0)|$ on $\\partial D$, it is the solution to the Dirichlet problem.\n\nThe final answer is: \n[QUESTION]\nLet $D = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2: |x| < 1\\}$ be the unit disk in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Find the solution $u(x)$ to the Dirichlet problem $\\Delta u = 0$ in $D$, $u(x) = \\log|x - (1,0)|$ on $\\partial D$.\n\n[ANSWER]\nThe solution to the Dirichlet problem is $u(x) = \\log|x - (1,0)|$ for $x \\in D$, because this function is harmonic in $D$ and takes the value $\\log|y - (1,0)|$ on $\\partial D$. Thus, $u(x)$ satisfies both the Laplace equation in $D$ and the given boundary condition on $\\partial D$.",

Instead, use $\\Gamma(n + \\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{(2n - 1)!!\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2^n}$.\n\nLet's simplify the expression further and correctly: $\\Gamma(n + \\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{(2n - 1)!!}{2^n}\\sqrt{\\pi}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{(2n - 1)!!\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2^n}}$.\n\n\n## Step 11: Checking the validity of the steps\nWe have derived the expression for $\\Gamma(n + \\frac{1}{2})$ and provided a step-by-step simplification.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\Gamma(n + \\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{(2n - 1)!!\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2^n}}$.\n\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{(2n)!\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2^{2n}n!}}$.\n\n\n## Step 12: Verification of the result\nTo verify, let's directly check for $n = 0$ and $n = 1$.\n\nFor $n = 0$, $\\Gamma(\\frac{1}{2}) = \\sqrt{\\pi}$, which is correct.\n\nFor $n = 1$, $\\Gamma(\\frac{3}{2}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2}$.\n\nThus, our derivation is correct.\n\nThe best answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{(2n)!\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2^{2n}n!}}$.",

Ergodic theory is a branch of mathematics that studies the behavior of dynamical systems over time, focusing on their statistical properties. Key concepts include ergodicity, measure-preserving transformations, and the ergodic theorem.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a problem\nTo create a problem, we need to incorporate concepts from dynamical systems and ergodic theory. A potential problem could involve analyzing the behavior of a specific dynamical system, such as determining if it is ergodic or calculating its invariant measures.\n\n## Step 4: Specify the problem\nLet's consider a simple yet challenging example: the rotation map on the unit circle. The unit circle can be represented as $\\mathbb{T} = \\mathbb{R}/\\mathbb{Z}$, and a rotation map $T: \\mathbb{T} \\to \\mathbb{T}$ is defined by $T(x) = x + \\alpha \\mod 1$, where $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n## Step 5: Formulate the question\nWe can ask whether the rotation map $T$ is ergodic with respect to the Lebesgue measure on $\\mathbb{T}$ when $\\alpha$ is irrational.\n\n## Step 6: Write the problem statement\n\"Let $T: \\mathbb{T} \\to \\mathbb{T}$ be defined by $T(x) = x + \\alpha \\mod 1$, where $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is irrational. Prove that $T$ is ergodic with respect to the Lebesgue measure on $\\mathbb{T}$.\"\n\n## Step 7: Provide the solution\nTo prove that $T$ is ergodic, we need to show that if $A \\subset \\mathbb{T}$ is $T$-invariant (i.e., $T(A) = A$) and measurable, then either $m(A) = 0$ or $m(A) = 1$, where $m$ denotes the Lebesgue measure.\n\n## Step 8: Detail the solution\nFirst, recall that $T$ is measure-preserving because $m(T^{-1}(A)) = m(A)$ for any measurable $A \\subset \\mathbb{T}$. For $T$ to be ergodic, we must show that $T$-invariant sets have measure 0 or 1.\n\n## Step 9: Use Fourier analysis to prove ergodicity\nConsider a $T$-invariant set $A$. The characteristic function $\\chi_A$ of $A$ is $T$-invariant, meaning $\\chi_A(T(x)) = \\chi_A(x)$. We can expand $\\chi_A$ in a Fourier series: $\\chi_A(x) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} c_n e^{2\\pi inx}$, where $c_n = \\int_{\\mathbb{T}} \\chi_A(x)e^{-2\\pi inx} dx$.\n\n## Step 10: Apply $T$-invariance to the Fourier series\nSince $\\chi_A(T(x)) = \\chi_A(x + \\alpha) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} c_n e^{2\\pi in(x + \\alpha)} = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} c_n e^{2\\pi in\\alpha}e^{2\\pi inx}$, and this equals $\\chi_A(x)$, we have $c_n = c_n e^{2\\pi in\\alpha}$ for all $n$. For $\\alpha$ irrational, $e^{2\\pi in\\alpha} \\neq 1$ unless $n = 0$. Thus, $c_n = 0$ for $n \\neq 0$.\n\n## Step 11: Conclude ergodicity from the Fourier analysis\nThis implies $\\chi_A(x) = c_0 = \\int_{\\mathbb{T}} \\chi_A(x) dx = m(A)$, meaning $\\chi_A$ is constant. Hence, $A$ is either $\\mathbb{T}$ (if $m(A) = 1$) or $\\emptyset$ (if $m(A) = 0$), proving $T$ is ergodic.\n\n## Step 12: Format the question and answer according to the required structure\n\nLet $T: \\mathbb{T} \\to \\mathbb{T}$ be defined by $T(x) = x + \\alpha \\mod 1$, where $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is irrational. Prove that $T$ is ergodic with respect to the Lebesgue measure on $\\mathbb{T}$.",

            "raw_answer": "## Step 1: Understand the task\nThe task is to generate a challenging but solvable mathematics problem in the domain of dynamical systems and ergodic theory, along with a complete and verifiable solution.\n\n## Step 2: Identify key concepts in dynamical systems and ergodic theory\nDynamical systems involve the study of the behavior of systems that change over time according to certain rules. Ergodic theory is a branch of mathematics that studies the behavior of dynamical systems over time, focusing on their statistical properties. Key concepts include ergodicity, measure-preserving transformations, and the ergodic theorem.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a problem\nTo create a problem, we need to incorporate concepts from dynamical systems and ergodic theory. A potential problem could involve analyzing the behavior of a specific dynamical system, such as determining if it is ergodic or calculating its invariant measures.\n\n## Step 4: Specify the problem\nLet's consider a simple yet challenging example: the rotation map on the unit circle. The unit circle can be represented as $\\mathbb{T} = \\mathbb{R}/\\mathbb{Z}$, and a rotation map $T: \\mathbb{T} \\to \\mathbb{T}$ is defined by $T(x) = x + \\alpha \\mod 1$, where $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n## Step 5: Formulate the question\nWe can ask whether the rotation map $T$ is ergodic with respect to the Lebesgue measure on $\\mathbb{T}$ when $\\alpha$ is irrational.\n\n## Step 6: Write the problem statement\n\"Let $T: \\mathbb{T} \\to \\mathbb{T}$ be defined by $T(x) = x + \\alpha \\mod 1$, where $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is irrational. Prove that $T$ is ergodic with respect to the Lebesgue measure on $\\mathbb{T}$.\"\n\n## Step 7: Provide the solution\nTo prove that $T$ is ergodic, we need to show that if $A \\subset \\mathbb{T}$ is $T$-invariant (i.e., $T(A) = A$) and measurable, then either $m(A) = 0$ or $m(A) = 1$, where $m$ denotes the Lebesgue measure.\n\n## Step 8: Detail the solution\nFirst, recall that $T$ is measure-preserving because $m(T^{-1}(A)) = m(A)$ for any measurable $A \\subset \\mathbb{T}$. For $T$ to be ergodic, we must show that $T$-invariant sets have measure 0 or 1.\n\n## Step 9: Use Fourier analysis to prove ergodicity\nConsider a $T$-invariant set $A$. The characteristic function $\\chi_A$ of $A$ is $T$-invariant, meaning $\\chi_A(T(x)) = \\chi_A(x)$. We can expand $\\chi_A$ in a Fourier series: $\\chi_A(x) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} c_n e^{2\\pi inx}$, where $c_n = \\int_{\\mathbb{T}} \\chi_A(x)e^{-2\\pi inx} dx$.\n\n## Step 10: Apply $T$-invariance to the Fourier series\nSince $\\chi_A(T(x)) = \\chi_A(x + \\alpha) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} c_n e^{2\\pi in(x + \\alpha)} = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} c_n e^{2\\pi in\\alpha}e^{2\\pi inx}$, and this equals $\\chi_A(x)$, we have $c_n = c_n e^{2\\pi in\\alpha}$ for all $n$. For $\\alpha$ irrational, $e^{2\\pi in\\alpha} \\neq 1$ unless $n = 0$. Thus, $c_n = 0$ for $n \\neq 0$.\n\n## Step 11: Conclude ergodicity from the Fourier analysis\nThis implies $\\chi_A(x) = c_0 = \\int_{\\mathbb{T}} \\chi_A(x) dx = m(A)$, meaning $\\chi_A$ is constant. Hence, $A$ is either $\\mathbb{T}$ (if $m(A) = 1$) or $\\emptyset$ (if $m(A) = 0$), proving $T$ is ergodic.\n\n## Step 12: Format the question and answer according to the required structure\n[QUESTION]\nLet $T: \\mathbb{T} \\to \\mathbb{T}$ be defined by $T(x) = x + \\alpha \\mod 1$, where $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is irrational. Prove that $T$ is ergodic with respect to the Lebesgue measure on $\\mathbb{T}$.\n\n[ANSWER]\nTo prove $T$ is ergodic, we show that any $T$-invariant measurable set $A \\subset \\mathbb{T}$ has $m(A) = 0$ or $m(A) = 1$. Consider the Fourier series of $\\chi_A$: $\\chi_A(x) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} c_n e^{2\\pi inx}$. Since $\\chi_A$ is $T$-invariant, we have $\\chi_A(x + \\alpha) = \\chi_A(x)$, which implies $c_n = c_n e^{2\\pi in\\alpha}$. For irrational $\\alpha$, this forces $c_n = 0$ for $n \\neq 0$. Thus, $\\chi_A(x) = c_0 = m(A)$, so $\\chi_A$ is constant, and $A$ has measure 0 or 1. This proves $T$ is ergodic.",

However, the given $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ is not directly provided; instead, we have $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ expressed in terms of its Fourier transform. We need to directly compute $f(x)$ using the definition of the inverse Fourier transform.\n\n## Step 7: Check if the problem is solvable and meaningful\nThe problem is to find $f(x)$ given $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\xi^2)^{3/2}}$.

We need to use these properties to prove that $I - T^2$ is positive.\n\n## Step 2: Recall relevant properties of self-adjoint operators\nSince $T$ is self-adjoint, $T = T^*$, which implies that $\\langle Tx, y \\rangle = \\langle x, Ty \\rangle$ for all $x, y \\in H$. Also, for a self-adjoint operator, $\\|T\\| = \\sup_{\\|x\\| = 1} |\\langle Tx, x \\rangle|$.\n\n## Step 3: Examine the expression $\\langle (I - T^2)x, x \\rangle$\nFor any $x \\in H$, $\\langle (I - T^2)x, x \\rangle = \\langle x, x \\rangle - \\langle T^2x, x \\rangle = \\|x\\|^2 - \\langle Tx, Tx \\rangle = \\|x\\|^2 - \\|Tx\\|^2$.\n\n## Step 4: Use the given condition $\\|T\\| \\leq 1$ to establish the positivity of $I - T^2$\nSince $\\|T\\| \\leq 1$, for any $x \\in H$, $\\|Tx\\| \\leq \\|T\\|\\|x\\| \\leq 1 \\cdot \\|x\\| = \\|x\\|$. Thus, $\\|Tx\\|^2 \\leq \\|x\\|^2$, which implies $\\|x\\|^2 - \\|Tx\\|^2 \\geq 0$.\n\n## Step 5: Conclude that $I - T^2$ is positive\nFrom Step 3, $\\langle (I - T^2)x, x \\rangle = \\|x\\|^2 - \\|Tx\\|^2$, and from Step 4, $\\|x\\|^2 - \\|Tx\\|^2 \\geq 0$. Therefore, $\\langle (I - T^2)x, x \\rangle \\geq 0$ for all $x \\in H$, proving that $I - T^2$ is positive.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$ is not required as the task was to prove that $I - T^2$ is positive, which has been demonstrated. $$ is not needed here as the response format does not require it for the answer box.

Substituting into $1 = c_1e + c_2e^{-1}$ gives $1 = c_1e - c_1e^{-1}$, which simplifies to $1 = c_1(e - e^{-1})$. Thus, $c_1 = \\frac{1}{e - e^{-1}}$ and $c_2 = -c_1$.\n\n## Step 14: Verify the solution\n$c_1 = \\frac{1}{e - e^{-1}}$ and $c_2 = -\\frac{1}{e - e^{-1}}$.

A suitable topic could involve the properties of curves or surfaces, such as curvature, geodesics, or the application of differential geometry to other areas like physics.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a specific problem\nLet's consider a problem involving the curvature of a surface. A classic result in differential geometry is the Theorema Egregium of Gauss, which states that the Gaussian curvature of a surface is invariant under isometric deformations.

We need to show that there exists a convergent subnet.\n\n#### Step 1: Understand the given condition\nThe space $X$ being compact means that every open cover of $X$ has a finite subcover.\n\n#### Step 2: Relate compactness to the net\nFor a net $(x_i)_{i \\in I}$, if it does not have a convergent subnet, it implies that for any $x \\in X$, there exists a neighborhood $U_x$ of $x$ such that the set $\\{i \\in I : x_i \\notin U_x\\}$ is cofinal in $I$. This is not directly relevant but illustrates the concept of convergence in relation to compactness.\n\n#### Step 3: Use the definition of compactness to show the existence of a convergent subnet\nSince $X$ is compact, it is not straightforward to directly apply this property to show that every net has a convergent subnet without additional topological concepts.\n\n### Direction 2: Showing that every net has a convergent subnet implies compactness\n\nAssume $X$ is not compact. Then, there exists an open cover $\\{U_\\alpha\\}$ of $X$ without a finite subcover. For each $x \\in X$, choose $U_{\\alpha(x)}$ such that $x \\in U_{\\alpha(x)}$. The set of all such $\\alpha(x)$ is not finite, implying that $\\{U_{\\alpha(x)}\\}$ is not a finite cover.\n\n## Step 9: Provide the final answer in the required format\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{Let $X$ be a topological space.

The probability density functions (pdfs) of $X$ and $Y$ are given by $f_X(x) = \\lambda e^{-\\lambda x}$ for $x \\geq 0$ and $f_Y(y) = \\mu e^{-\\mu y}$ for $y \\geq 0$, respectively.\n\n## Step 2: Derive the distribution of $Z = \\min(X, Y)$\nTo find the distribution of $Z$, we first determine the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of $Z$. For $z \\geq 0$, we have:\n\\[F_Z(z) = \\mathbb{P}(Z \\leq z) = \\mathbb{P}(\\min(X, Y) \\leq z) = 1 - \\mathbb{P}(\\min(X, Y) > z) = 1 - \\mathbb{P}(X > z, Y > z).\\]\nSince $X$ and $Y$ are independent, $\\mathbb{P}(X > z, Y > z) = \\mathbb{P}(X > z)\\mathbb{P}(Y > z)$. Thus,\n\\[F_Z(z) = 1 - \\mathbb{P}(X > z)\\mathbb{P}(Y > z) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda z}e^{-\\mu z} = 1 - e^{-(\\lambda + \\mu)z}.\\]\nThis is the CDF of an exponential distribution with rate parameter $\\lambda + \\mu$, so $Z \\sim \\text{Exp}(\\lambda + \\mu)$.\n\n## Step 3: Derive the probability density function (pdf) of $Z$\nThe pdf of $Z$, denoted $f_Z(z)$, is the derivative of $F_Z(z)$ with respect to $z$. Hence,\n\\[f_Z(z) = \\frac{d}{dz}F_Z(z) = \\frac{d}{dz}(1 - e^{-(\\lambda + \\mu)z}) = (\\lambda + \\mu)e^{-(\\lambda + \\mu)z}\\]\nfor $z \\geq 0$. This confirms that $Z$ follows an exponential distribution with rate $\\lambda + \\mu$.\n\n## Step 4: Compute $\\mathbb{E}[Z]$\nThe expectation of $Z$, $\\mathbb{E}[Z]$, for $Z \\sim \\text{Exp}(\\lambda + \\mu)$ is given by $\\frac{1}{\\lambda + \\mu}$ because the mean of an exponentially distributed random variable with rate parameter $\\theta$ is $\\frac{1}{\\theta}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{\\lambda + \\mu}}$",

To simplify this expression, we first simplify the terms inside: $x_2 = \\frac{1}{e - 2} - \\frac{e^{\\frac{1}{e - 2}} - \\frac{2 + (e - 2)}{e - 2}}{e^{\\frac{1}{e - 2}} - 2} = \\frac{1}{e - 2} - \\frac{e^{\\frac{1}{e - 2}} - \\frac{e}{e - 2}}{e^{\\frac{1}{e - 2}} - 2}$.\n\n## Step 6: Further simplification of $x_2$\nSimplifying further, $x_2 = \\frac{1}{e - 2} - \\frac{\\frac{(e - 2)e^{\\frac{1}{e - 2}} - e}{e - 2}}{\\frac{e^{\\frac{1}{e - 2}}(e - 2) - 2(e - 2)}{e - 2}} = \\frac{1}{e - 2} - \\frac{(e - 2)e^{\\frac{1}{e - 2}} - e}{(e - 2)(e^{\\frac{1}{e - 2}} - 2)}$.\n\n## Step 7: Final simplification of $x_2$\nLet's simplify the expression algebraically. $x_2 = \\frac{1}{e - 2} - \\frac{(e - 2)e^{\\frac{1}{e - 2}} - e}{(e - 2)(e^{\\frac{1}{e - 2}} - 2)} = \\frac{e^{\\frac{1}{e - 2}} - 2 - e^{\\frac{1}{e - 2}} + \\frac{e}{e - 2}}{e^{\\frac{1}{e - 2}} - 2}$.\n\n## Step 8: Simplify the expression for $x_2$ further\n$x_2 = \\frac{\\frac{e}{e - 2} - 2}{e^{\\frac{1}{e - 2}} - 2} = \\frac{\\frac{e - 2(e - 2)}{e - 2}}{e^{\\frac{1}{e - 2}} - 2} = \\frac{\\frac{e - 2e + 4}{e - 2}}{e^{\\frac{1}{e - 2}} - 2} = \\frac{\\frac{4 - e}{e - 2}}{e^{\\frac{1}{e - 2}} - 2}$.\n\n## Step 9: Final calculation for $x_2$\n$x_2 = \\frac{4 - e}{(e - 2)e^{\\frac{1}{e - 2}} - 2(e - 2)}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{4 - e}{(e - 2)e^{\\frac{1}{e - 2}} - 2(e - 2)}}$",
