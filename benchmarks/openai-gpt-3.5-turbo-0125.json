Prove that $ba = ab$.\n\n[ANSWER]\nTo prove that $ba = ab$, we will use the given properties of the elements $a$ and $b$.\n\nSince $ab = ba$, we have $(ab)^2 = (ba)^2$. Expanding both sides, we get:\n$$(ab)^2 = (ba)^2$$\n$$abab = baba$$\n\nNow, we know that $a^3 = e$ and $b^2 = e$. Using these properties, we can rewrite the above equation as:\n$$a^2b = b^2a$$\n$$ab = ba$$\n\nTherefore, we have shown that $ba = ab$, as required.",
