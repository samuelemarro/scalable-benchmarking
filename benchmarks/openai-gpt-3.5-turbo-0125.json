Using these properties, we can rewrite the above equation as:\n$$a^2b = b^2a$$\n$$ab = ba$$\n\nTherefore, we have shown that $ba = ab$, as required.",

The cosine function is an even function, so we have:\n$$2\\int_{0}^{x} e^{-t^2} \\cos(t) dt = 2\\int_{0}^{x} e^{-t^2} \\cos(t) dt = 2\\int_{0}^{x} e^{-t^2} \\cos(t) dt.$$\n\nNext, we can use integration by parts with $u = \\cos(t)$ and $dv = e^{-t^2} dt$ to simplify the integral:\n$$\\int e^{-t^2} \\cos(t) dt = \\frac{1}{2} e^{-t^2} \\sin(t) + \\frac{1}{2} \\int e^{-t^2} \\sin(t) dt.$$\n\nSubstitute this back into the integral equation, we get:\n$$2\\left(\\frac{1}{2} e^{-x^2} \\sin(x) + \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{x} e^{-t^2} \\sin(t) dt\\right) = 0.$$\n\nSince $e^{-x^2} \\sin(x)$ is continuous and differentiable, we can differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to $x$ to find the critical points. After differentiation, we get:\n$$e^{-x^2} \\sin(x) + e^{-x^2} \\cos(x) = 0.$$\n\nDividing by $e^{-x^2}$ (which is never zero), we have:\n$$\\sin(x) + \\cos(x) = 0.$$\n\nSolving this trigonometric equation gives us the solutions for $x$.",

We have:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} \\nu(A) &= \\nu(T^{-1}(A)) \\\\ &= \\nu(\\{x \\in [0, 1) : 2x \\mod 1 \\in [0, 1/2)\\}) \\\\ &= \\nu(\\{x \\in [0, 1) : 2x \\in [0, 1)\\}) \\\\ &= \\nu([0, 1)) \\\\ &= 1 \\end{aligned}$$\n\nHowever, since $\\nu$ is a measure, we must have $\\nu([0, 1/2)) + \\nu([1/2, 1)) = \\nu([0, 1))$, which implies $\\nu([1/2, 1)) = 0$. \n\nThis contradicts the fact that $\\nu(T^{-1}([1/2, 1)) = \\nu([0, 1/2)) = 1$.\n\nTherefore, there can only be one measure satisfying the invariance property, and thus the dynamical system is uniquely ergodic.",

By the triangle inequality, we have:\n$$\n\\|Ty - Tx\\| \\leq \\|Ty - y\\| + \\|y - x\\| < \\|y\\| + \\varepsilon = \\|y\\| + \\|x\\| - \\|Tx\\|.\n$$\n\nSince $x \\in B$, we have $\\|Tx\\| < \\|x\\|$, which implies $\\|y\\| + \\|x\\| - \\|Tx\\| > \\|y\\|$. Therefore, $\\|Ty - Tx\\| < \\|y\\|$, which means $y \\in B$. This shows that $B_{\\varepsilon}(x) \\subseteq B$.\n\nThus, for every $x \\in B$, we have found an $\\varepsilon > 0$ such that $B_{\\varepsilon}(x) \\subseteq B$, proving that $B$ is an open subset of $X$.",

In other words, $r^n$ must be a multiple of $x^2 - 4$.\n\nSince $x^2 - 4 = (x - 2)(x + 2)$, any $r$ such that $r^n$ is a multiple of $x^2 - 4$ must have factors of $(x - 2)$ and $(x + 2)$ raised to at least the power $n$. Therefore, the elements in $\\sqrt{I}$ are of the form $r = a(x - 2)^n(x + 2)^m$, where $a \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and $n, m \\geq 0$.\n\nHence, the radical $\\sqrt{I}$ of the ideal $I = \\langle x^2 - 4 \\rangle$ in the ring $R = \\mathbb{Z}[x]$ is the set of all polynomials of the form $a(x - 2)^n(x + 2)^m$, where $a \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and $n, m \\geq 0$.",

Consider the set $G \\setminus N_G(H)$.\n\nLet $g \\in G \\setminus N_G(H)$. This means there exists $h \\in H$ such that $ghg^{-1} \\neq h$. Since $H$ is closed and the map $g \\mapsto ghg^{-1}$ is continuous (as $G$ is a Lie group), there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $g$ such that for all $g' \\in U$, $g'hg'^{-1} \\neq h$. This implies $U \\subseteq G \\setminus N_G(H)$.\n\nTherefore, $G \\setminus N_G(H)$ is open, making $N_G(H)$ closed in $G.\n\nThus, we have shown that the normalizer $N_G(H)$ is a closed subgroup of the connected Lie group $G$.",

In other words, $\\mu_2(\\{1/3\\}) = 1$ and $\\mu_2(A) = 0$ for all other measurable sets $A$.\n\nWe will show that $\\mu_2$ is also an invariant measure under the dynamical system. For any set $A$ measurable in the Borel $\\sigma$-algebra of $[0, 1)$, we have:\n\n$$\\mu_2(T^{-1}(A)) = \\mu_2(\\{x \\in [0, 1) : 2x \\mod 1 \\in A\\})$$\n\nSince the transformation $T$ is $2x \\mod 1$, we see that $T^{-1}(A)$ contains $\\frac{1}{2}A$ and $\\frac{1}{2}A + \\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, if $\\frac{1}{3} \\in A$, then $\\frac{1}{2}A + \\frac{1}{2}$ contains $\\frac{1}{3}$, and $\\mu_2(T^{-1}(A)) = 1$. If $\\frac{1}{3} \\notin A$, then $\\mu_2(T^{-1}(A)) = 0$. This shows that $\\mu_2$ is also invariant under the dynamical system.\n\nSince we have found two distinct invariant measures, namely $\\mu_1$ and $\\mu_2$, the dynamical system defined by $x_{n+1} = 2x_n \\mod 1$ for $n \\geq 0$, where $x_0 \\in [0, 1)$ is not uniquely ergodic.",

            "raw_answer": "To find $f(2022)$ using the given functional equation $f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) + 2xy$, we can proceed as follows:\n\nGiven $f(1) = 3$ and $f(2) = 7$, we first find $f(3)$:\nSubstitute $x = 1$ and $y = 2$ into the functional equation:\n$$f(1 + 2) = f(1) + f(2) + 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2$$\n$$f(3) = 3 + 7 + 4 = 14$$\n\nNext, we find $f(2022)$ by expressing $2022$ as a sum of smaller numbers. For example, $2022 = 3 \\cdot 673$. Using this decomposition:\n$$f(2022) = f(3 \\cdot 673) = f(3) + f(673) + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 673$$\n\nNow, we need to find $f(673)$. We can express $673$ as a sum of smaller numbers, for instance, $673 = 1 + 672$. Using this:\n$$f(673) = f(1) + f(672) + 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 672$$\n\nTo find $f(672)$, we express $672$ as $672 = 2 \\cdot 336$. Using the functional equation:\n$$f(672) = f(2) + f(336) + 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 336$$\n$$f(672) = 7 + f(336) + 1344$$\n\nContinuing this process, we eventually reach $f(336)$. We can express $336$ as $336 = 2 \\cdot 168$. Using the functional equation:\n$$f(336) = f(2) + f(168) + 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 168$$\n$$f(336) = 7 + f(168) + 672$$\n\nFurther, we express $168$ as $168 = 2 \\cdot 84$. Using the functional equation:\n$$f(168) = f(2) + f(84) + 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 84$$\n$$f(168) = 7 + f(84) + 336$$\n\nContinuing this process, we express $84$ as $84 = 2 \\cdot 42$. Using the functional equation:\n$$f(84) = f(2) + f(42) + 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 42$$\n$$f(84) = 7 + f(42) + 168$$\n\nNext, we express $42$ as $42 = 2 \\cdot 21$. Using the functional equation:\n$$f(42) = f(2) + f(21) + 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 21$$\n$$f(42) = 7 + f(21) + 84$$\n\nFinally, we express $21$ as $21 = 1 + 20$. Using the functional equation:\n$$f(21) = f(1) + f(20) + 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 20$$\n$$f(21) = 3 + f(20) + 40$$\n\nNow, we find $f(20)$ by expressing $20$ as $20 = 2 \\cdot 10$. Using the functional equation:\n$$f(20) = f(2) + f(10) + 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10$$\n$$f(20) = 7 + f(10) + 40$$\n\nFurther, we express $10$ as $10 = 1 + 9$. Using the functional equation:\n$$f(10) = f(1) + f(9) + 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 9$$\n$$f(10) = 3 + f(9) + 18$$\n\nFinally, we find $f(9)$ by expressing $9$ as $9 = 3 \\cdot 3$. Using the functional equation:\n$$f(9) = f(3) + f(3) + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3$$\n$$f(9) = 14 + 14 + 18 = 46$$\n\nNow, substituting back the values we found into the expression for $f(2022)$:\n$$f(2022) =

Determine the probability density function of $Y$, i.e., find $f_Y(y)$ for all possible values of $y$.\n\n[ANSWER]\nTo find the probability density function $f_Y(y)$ of the random variable $Y = X^2$, we need to consider the transformation of random variables.\n\nGiven $Y = X^2$, we can express $X$ in terms of $Y$ as $X = \\sqrt{Y}$ for $0 \\leq \\sqrt{y} \\leq 1$, which implies $0 \\leq y \\leq 1$.\n\nThe probability density function of $Y$, denoted as $f_Y(y)$, can be found using the formula for transforming probability density functions:\n$$ f_Y(y) = f_X(g^{-1}(y)) \\left| \\frac{d}{dy} g^{-1}(y) \\right| $$\n\nHere, $g(x) = x^2$ and $g^{-1}(y) = \\sqrt{y}$.\n\n1.
