Since $f$ is order-preserving, for each $a \\in A$, $f(\\bigwedge A) \\leq f(a) = a$ because $f(a) = a$ for all $a \\in A$.\n   - Therefore, $f(\\bigwedge A) \\leq \\bigwedge A$.\n   - Since $f$ is order-preserving and $f(\\bigwedge A) \\leq \\bigwedge A$, we have $f(f(\\bigwedge A)) \\leq f(\\bigwedge A)$.\n   - But $f(f(\\bigwedge A)) = f(\\bigwedge A)$ because $f$ is a function on $L$.\n   - Thus, $f(\\bigwedge A) = \\bigwedge A$, showing that $\\bigwedge A \\in F$.\n\n3. **Closure under joins:**\n   - Consider the join $\\bigvee A$ in $L$. For each $a \\in A$, $a \\leq \\bigvee A$, so $f(a) \\leq f(\\bigvee A)$.\n   - Since $f(a) = a$ for all $a \\in A$, we have $a \\leq f(\\bigvee A)$ for all $a \\in A$.\n   - Therefore, $\\bigvee A \\leq f(\\bigvee A)$.\n   - Since $f$ is order-preserving and $\\bigvee A \\leq f(\\bigvee A)$, we have $f(\\bigvee A) \\leq f(f(\\bigvee A)) = f(\\bigvee A)$.\n   - Thus, $f(\\bigvee A) = \\bigvee A$, showing that $\\bigvee A \\in F$.\n\n4. **Completeness:**\n   - Since $F$ is closed under arbitrary meets and joins, it is a complete sublattice of $L$.\n\nTherefore, the set of fixed points $F$ is a complete sublattice of $L$.",

However, let's verify this further by checking other products:\n\n- $e_1 e_2 = e_3$ and $e_2 e_1 = -e_3$, which satisfies anticommutativity.\n- $e_2 e_2 = e_1$, but $e_2 e_2$ should be $-e_2 e_2$, which is not possible unless $e_1 = 0$.\n- $e_3 e_1 = e_1$ and $e_1 e_3$ is not defined, but for anticommutativity, $e_1 e_3 = -e_3 e_1 = -e_1$, which is not given.\n- $e_3 e_2 = e_2$ and $e_2 e_3$ is not defined, but for anticommutativity, $e_2 e_3 = -e_3 e_2 = -e_2$, which is not given.\n- $e_3 e_3 = e_3$, but $e_3 e_3$ should be $-e_3 e_3$, which is not possible unless $e_3 = 0$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe algebra $A$ does not satisfy the anticommutativity property required for a Lie algebra. Therefore, $A$ is not a Lie algebra.\n\nSince $A$ is not a Lie algebra, we do not need to check the Jacobi identity or find the dimension of its center. The failure of anticommutativity is sufficient to conclude that $A$ is not a Lie algebra.",

Define $v(x, y) = x^2 + y^2$, so $u(x, y) = \\log \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - v(x, y)} \\right)$.\n\nThe partial derivatives of $u$ are:\n\n1. $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\log \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - v(x, y)} \\right) = \\frac{1}{1 - v(x, y)} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( -v(x, y) \\right) = \\frac{2x}{1 - (x^2 + y^2)}$.\n\n2. $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = \\frac{d}{dy} \\log \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - v(x, y)} \\right) = \\frac{1}{1 - v(x, y)} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left( -v(x, y) \\right) = \\frac{2y}{1 - (x^2 + y^2)}$.\n\nNext, compute the second partial derivatives:\n\n1. $\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( \\frac{2x}{1 - (x^2 + y^2)} \\right) = \\frac{2(1 - (x^2 + y^2)) - 2x(2x)}{(1 - (x^2 + y^2))^2} = \\frac{2 - 2x^2 - 2y^2}{(1 - (x^2 + y^2))^2}$.\n\n2. $\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left( \\frac{2y}{1 - (x^2 + y^2)} \\right) = \\frac{2(1 - (x^2 + y^2)) - 2y(2y)}{(1 - (x^2 + y^2))^2} = \\frac{2 - 2x^2 - 2y^2}{(1 - (x^2 + y^2))^2}$.\n\nAdding these, we find:\n\n$$ \\Delta u = \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} = \\frac{2 - 2x^2 - 2y^2}{(1 - (x^2 + y^2))^2} + \\frac{2 - 2x^2 - 2y^2}{(1 - (x^2 + y^2))^2} = 0. $$\n\nThus, $u$ is harmonic on $D$.\n\nTo determine if $u$ can be extended to a harmonic function on $\\overline{D}$, consider the behavior of $u$ as $|z| \\to 1$. As $|z| \\to 1$, $1 - |z|^2 \\to 0^+$, and thus $u(z) = \\log \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - |z|^2} \\right) \\to \\infty$. Therefore, $u$ cannot be extended to a harmonic function on the closed unit disk $\\overline{D}$ because it becomes unbounded as $|z| \\to 1$.",

A point $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is a limit point of $A$ if every open interval $(x - \\epsilon, x + \\epsilon)$ for $\\epsilon > 0$ contains a point of $A$ different from $x$. \n\nSince the sequence $\\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right)$ converges to $0$, for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists an $N \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that for all $n \\geq N$, $\\frac{1}{n} < \\epsilon$. Thus, $0$ is a limit point of $A$.\n\nNow, consider any point $x > 0$. For $x$ to be a limit point of $A$, every open interval $(x - \\epsilon, x + \\epsilon)$ must contain a point of $A$. However, since $A$ consists of positive numbers that get arbitrarily small, for sufficiently small $\\epsilon$, the interval $(x - \\epsilon, x + \\epsilon)$ will not contain any points of $A$ if $x$ is not $0$. Therefore, no $x > 0$ can be a limit point of $A$.\n\nSince $A$ is a subset of $\\mathbb{R}$ and $0$ is a limit point of $A$, the closure $\\overline{A}$ is the union of $A$ and its limit points. Therefore, $\\overline{A} = A \\cup \\{0\\}$.\n\nThus, the closure of $A$ in $\\mathbb{R}$ is $\\overline{A} = \\{0\\} \\cup \\{ \\frac{1}{n} \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\}$.",

Trapezoidal Rule:**\n\nThe Trapezoidal Rule for approximating the integral $\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \\, dx$ with $n$ subintervals is given by:\n\n$$ T_n = \\frac{b-a}{2n} \\left[ f(x_0) + 2 \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} f(x_i) + f(x_n) \\right], $$\n\nwhere $x_i = a + i \\frac{b-a}{n}$ for $i = 0, 1, \\ldots, n$.\n\nFor $I = \\int_{0}^{1} e^{-x^2} \\, dx$ with $n = 4$, we have $a = 0$, $b = 1$, and $h = \\frac{1-0}{4} = 0.25$. The points are $x_0 = 0$, $x_1 = 0.25$, $x_2 = 0.5$, $x_3 = 0.75$, and $x_4 = 1$.\n\nCalculate $f(x_i)$ for each $x_i$:\n\n- $f(x_0) = e^{-0^2} = 1$,\n- $f(x_1) = e^{-(0.25)^2} = e^{-0.0625} \\approx 0.93941306$,\n- $f(x_2) = e^{-(0.5)^2} = e^{-0.25} \\approx 0.77880078$,\n- $f(x_3) = e^{-(0.75)^2} = e^{-0.5625} \\approx 0.56978282$,\n- $f(x_4) = e^{-(1)^2} = e^{-1} \\approx 0.36787944$.\n\nNow apply the Trapezoidal Rule:\n\n$$ T_4 = \\frac{1-0}{2 \\times 4} \\left[ 1 + 2(0.93941306 + 0.77880078 + 0.56978282) + 0.36787944 \\right]. $$\n\n$$ T_4 = \\frac{1}{8} \\left[ 1 + 2(2.28799666) + 0.36787944 \\right]. $$\n\n$$ T_4 = \\frac{1}{8} \\left[ 1 + 4.57599332 + 0.36787944 \\right]. $$\n\n$$ T_4 = \\frac{1}{8} \\times 5.94387276 \\approx 0.74298409. $$\n\n**2. Simpson's Rule:**\n\nSimpson's Rule for approximating the integral $\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \\, dx$ with $n$ subintervals (where $n$ is even) is given by:\n\n$$ S_n = \\frac{b-a}{3n} \\left[ f(x_0) + 4 \\sum_{\\text{odd } i} f(x_i) + 2 \\sum_{\\text{even } i} f(x_i) + f(x_n) \\right]. $$\n\nFor $n = 4$, we have the same $x_i$ and $f(x_i)$ as before.\n\nApply Simpson's Rule:\n\n$$ S_4 = \\frac{1-0}{3 \\times 4} \\left[ 1 + 4(0.93941306 + 0.56978282) + 2(0.77880078) + 0.36787944 \\right]. $$\n\n$$ S_4 = \\frac{1}{12} \\left[ 1 + 4(1.50919588) + 2(0.77880078) + 0.36787944 \\right]. $$\n\n$$ S_4 = \\frac{1}{12} \\left[ 1 + 6.03678352 + 1.55760156 + 0.36787944 \\right]. $$\n\n$$ S_4 = \\frac{1}{12} \\times 8.96226452 \\approx 0.74685538. $$\n\n**3. Comparison:**\n\nThe Trapezoidal Rule approximation is $T_4 \\approx 0.74298409$, and the Simpson's Rule approximation is $S_4 \\approx 0.74685538$.\n\nSimpson's Rule is generally more accurate than the Trapezoidal Rule for the same number of subintervals because it uses quadratic polynomials to approximate the function, which can better capture the curvature of the function $e^{-x^2}$ over the interval. Therefore, $S_4$ is likely to be closer to the true value of the integral than $T_4$.",

This would leave only 6 elements for the rest of the group, which is not possible because the remaining elements must form a subgroup whose order divides 6, and there must be a Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3, which would require at least 2 more elements (1 identity and 2 non-identity elements), leaving only 4 elements for a Sylow 2-subgroup, which is not possible.\n\nTherefore, $n_5$ cannot be 6, and we must have $n_5 = 1$. Hence, there is exactly one Sylow 5-subgroup, and it is normal in $G$.\n\nThus, $G$ has a normal subgroup of order 5.",

Thus, $Y(y) = D \\left(\\sinh(y) - \\frac{\\sinh(\\pi)}{\\cosh(\\pi)} \\cosh(y)\\right)$.\n\n### Constructing the Solution\n\nThe solution is:\n\n$$ u(x, y) = B \\sin(x) D \\left(\\sinh(y) - \\frac{\\sinh(\\pi)}{\\cosh(\\pi)} \\cosh(y)\\right). $$\n\nTo satisfy $u(x, 0) = \\sin(x)$, we set $B D \\left(\\sinh(0) - \\frac{\\sinh(\\pi)}{\\cosh(\\pi)} \\cosh(0)\\right) = 1$. Since $\\sinh(0) = 0$ and $\\cosh(0) = 1$, this simplifies to $-B D \\frac{\\sinh(\\pi)}{\\cosh(\\pi)} = 1$. Thus, $B D = -\\frac{\\cosh(\\pi)}{\\sinh(\\pi)}$.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n$$ u(x, y) = -\\frac{\\cosh(\\pi)}{\\sinh(\\pi)} \\sin(x) \\left(\\sinh(y) - \\frac{\\sinh(\\pi)}{\\cosh(\\pi)} \\cosh(y)\\right). $$\n\nThis function satisfies both the PDE and the given boundary conditions.",

The uniqueness theorem for the Fourier transform states that if $\\widehat{f}(\\xi) = 0$ for all $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}$, then $f = 0$ almost everywhere on $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n2. **Given Condition**: We are given that $\\widehat{f}(\\xi) = 0$ for all $\\xi$ in some open interval $I \\subset \\mathbb{R}$. We need to show that this implies $\\widehat{f}(\\xi) = 0$ for all $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n3. **Analyticity of the Fourier Transform**: The Fourier transform of an $L^1$ function is an entire function (a complex analytic function on the entire complex plane). This is because the Fourier transform can be extended to a complex function by considering $\\widehat{f}(z) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i z x} \\, dx$ for $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$, which is well-defined and analytic due to the exponential decay of the integrand.\n\n4. **Application of the Identity Theorem**: The identity theorem for analytic functions states that if an analytic function vanishes on an open set, it must vanish everywhere on its domain. Since $\\widehat{f}(\\xi)$ is analytic and vanishes on the open interval $I$, it must be zero for all $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since $\\widehat{f}(\\xi) = 0$ for all $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}$, by the uniqueness theorem for the Fourier transform, we conclude that $f = 0$ almost everywhere on $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThus, we have shown that if $f \\in L^1(\\mathbb{R})$ and $\\widehat{f}(\\xi) = 0$ for all $\\xi$ in some open interval $I \\subset \\mathbb{R}$, then $f = 0$ almost everywhere on $\\mathbb{R}$.",

Prove that $A$ is closed in $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n[ANSWER]\nTo prove that the set $A = \\{ \\frac{1}{n} \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\} \\cup \\{0\\}$ is closed in $\\mathbb{R}$, we need to show that its complement, $A^c = \\mathbb{R} \\setminus A$, is open in the standard topology on $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe set $A$ consists of the points $\\frac{1}{n}$ for each natural number $n$, along with the point $0$. The complement $A^c$ is therefore the set of all real numbers except these points:\n\n$$ A^c = \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\left( \\{ \\frac{1}{n} \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\} \\cup \\{0\\} \\right). $$\n\nTo show that $A^c$ is open, we need to demonstrate that for every point $x \\in A^c$, there exists an open interval $(x - \\epsilon, x + \\epsilon)$ contained entirely within $A^c$.\n\n1. **Case 1: $x > 0$ and $x \\neq \\frac{1}{n}$ for any $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.**\n\n   Since $x$ is not of the form $\\frac{1}{n}$, there exists an interval around $x$ that does not include any points of the form $\\frac{1}{n}$. Specifically, choose $\\epsilon > 0$ small enough such that $(x - \\epsilon, x + \\epsilon)$ does not contain any points $\\frac{1}{n}$. This is possible because the points $\\frac{1}{n}$ are isolated and become arbitrarily small as $n$ increases. Thus, $(x - \\epsilon, x + \\epsilon) \\subseteq A^c$.\n\n2. **Case 2: $x < 0$.**\n\n   For any negative $x$, there are no points of the form $\\frac{1}{n}$ or $0$ in any interval around $x$. Therefore, we can choose $\\epsilon > 0$ such that $(x - \\epsilon, x + \\epsilon)$ contains only negative numbers, which are all in $A^c$. Thus, $(x - \\epsilon, x + \\epsilon) \\subseteq A^c$.\n\n3. **Case 3: $x = 0$.**\n\n   The point $0$ is in $A$, not in $A^c$, so we do not consider this case for $A^c$.\n\nSince for every $x \\in A^c$, we can find an open interval around $x$ that is entirely contained in $A^c$, the set $A^c$ is open. Therefore, $A$ is closed in $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThus, we have shown that $A$ is closed in the standard topology on $\\mathbb{R}$.",

Among these, the numbers that satisfy $n_3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$ are 1 and 9.\n\nThus, $n_3$ could be either 1 or 9. \n\nIf $n_3 = 1$, then there is exactly one Sylow 3-subgroup in $G$, and by the Sylow theorems, this subgroup must be normal in $G$.\n\nIf $n_3 = 9$, then there are 9 distinct Sylow 3-subgroups. However, this would imply that the total number of elements in these subgroups is $9 \\times (3^2 - 3) = 9 \\times 6 = 54$, which exceeds the total number of elements in $G$. Therefore, $n_3$ cannot be 9.\n\nThus, the only possibility is $n_3 = 1$, meaning there is exactly one Sylow 3-subgroup, and it must be normal in $G$.\n\nTherefore, $G$ has a normal subgroup of order 3.",

We will determine $a$ and $b$ by substituting this form into the integral equation.\n\nSubstitute $f(t) = at + b$ into the integral:\n\n$$ \\int_0^1 (x + t) f(t) \\, dt = \\int_0^1 (x + t)(at + b) \\, dt. $$\n\nExpanding the integrand, we have:\n\n$$ (x + t)(at + b) = x(at + b) + t(at + b) = xat + xb + at^2 + bt. $$\n\nNow, integrate each term separately over $[0, 1]$:\n\n1. $\\int_0^1 xat \\, dt = xa \\int_0^1 t \\, dt = xa \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{xa}{2}$.\n2. $\\int_0^1 xb \\, dt = xb \\int_0^1 1 \\, dt = xb \\cdot 1 = xb$.\n3. $\\int_0^1 at^2 \\, dt = a \\int_0^1 t^2 \\, dt = a \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{a}{3}$.\n4. $\\int_0^1 bt \\, dt = b \\int_0^1 t \\, dt = b \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{b}{2}$.\n\nThus, the integral becomes:\n\n$$ \\int_0^1 (x + t) f(t) \\, dt = \\frac{xa}{2} + xb + \\frac{a}{3} + \\frac{b}{2}. $$\n\nSubstitute this back into the original equation:\n\n$$ f(x) = \\frac{xa}{2} + xb + \\frac{a}{3} + \\frac{b}{2} + x. $$\n\nSince $f(x) = ax + b$, equate the coefficients of $x$ and the constant terms:\n\n1. Coefficient of $x$: $a = \\frac{a}{2} + b + 1$.\n2. Constant term: $b = \\frac{a}{3} + \\frac{b}{2}$.\n\nSolve these equations:\n\nFrom the second equation:\n\n$$ b = \\frac{a}{3} + \\frac{b}{2} \\implies 2b = \\frac{2a}{3} + b \\implies b = \\frac{2a}{3}. $$\n\nSubstitute $b = \\frac{2a}{3}$ into the first equation:\n\n$$ a = \\frac{a}{2} + \\frac{2a}{3} + 1. $$\n\nCombine terms:\n\n$$ a = \\frac{a}{2} + \\frac{2a}{3} + 1 = \\frac{3a}{6} + \\frac{4a}{6} + 1 = \\frac{7a}{6} + 1. $$\n\nSolve for $a$:\n\n$$ a - \\frac{7a}{6} = 1 \\implies \\frac{6a - 7a}{6} = 1 \\implies -\\frac{a}{6} = 1 \\implies a = -6. $$\n\nSubstitute $a = -6$ into $b = \\frac{2a}{3}$:\n\n$$ b = \\frac{2(-6)}{3} = -4. $$\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n$$ f(x) = -6x - 4. $$\n\nVerification:\n\nSubstitute $f(x) = -6x - 4$ back into the original equation:\n\nLeft side: $f(x) = -6x - 4$.\n\nRight side:\n\n$$ \\int_0^1 (x + t)(-6t - 4) \\, dt + x. $$\n\nCalculate the integral:\n\n1. $\\int_0^1 -6t(x + t) \\, dt = \\int_0^1 (-6tx - 6t^2) \\, dt = -6x \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} - 6 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = -3x - 2$.\n2. $\\int_0^1 -4(x + t) \\, dt = \\int_0^1 (-4x - 4t) \\, dt = -4x \\cdot 1 - 4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = -4x - 2$.\n\nCombine:\n\n$$ -3x - 2 - 4x - 2 + x = -6x - 4. $$\n\nBoth sides match, confirming the solution is correct.\n\nThus, the explicit form of the function $f(x)$ is:\n\n$$ f(x) = -6x - 4. $$",

8$.\n\n3. **Third Iteration ($T^3(x)$):**\n   - If $0 \\leq x < \\frac{1}{27}$, then $T^3(x) = 27x$.\n   - If $\\frac{1}{27} \\leq x < \\frac{2}{27}$, then $T^3(x) = 27x - 1$.\n   - If $\\frac{2}{27} \\leq x < \\frac{3}{27}$, then $T^3(x) = 27x - 2$.\n   - If $\\frac{3}{27} \\leq x < \\frac{4}{27}$, then $T^3(x) = 27x - 3$.\n   - If $\\frac{4}{27} \\leq x < \\frac{5}{27}$, then $T^3(x) = 27x - 4$.\n   - If $\\frac{5}{27} \\leq x < \\frac{6}{27}$, then $T^3(x) = 27x -

This implies that for every $N \\geq 0$, the partial sum of the Fourier series is:\n   $$ S_N(f)(x) = \\sum_{n=-N}^{N} 0 \\cdot e^{2\\pi i n x} = 0. $$\n\n3. **Convergence of Fourier Series**: For $f \\in L^1(G)$, the Fourier series converges to $f(x)$ in the $L^1$ norm. Specifically, the Ces\u00e0ro means of the Fourier series, known as the Fej\u00e9r sums, converge to $f(x)$ almost everywhere. The Fej\u00e9r sum is given by:\n   $$ \\sigma_N(f)(x) = \\frac{1}{N+1} \\sum_{k=0}^{N} S_k(f)(x). $$\n\n4. **Fej\u00e9r's Theorem**: Fej\u00e9r's theorem states that $\\sigma_N(f)(x) \\to f(x)$ in $L^1$ norm as $N \\to \\infty$. Since $S_k(f)(x) = 0$ for all $k$, we have:\n   $$ \\sigma_N(f)(x) = \\frac{1}{N+1} \\sum_{k=0}^{N} 0 = 0. $$\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since $\\sigma_N(f)(x) \\to f(x)$ in $L^1$ norm and $\\sigma_N(f)(x) = 0$ for all $N$, it follows that $f(x) = 0$ almost everywhere on $G$.\n\nThus, if all Fourier coefficients of $f$ are zero, then $f = 0$ almost everywhere on the circle group $G = \\mathbb{T}$.

Check: $T\\left(\\frac{4}{15}\\right) = 4 \\cdot \\frac{4}{15} - 1 = \\frac{16}{15} - 1 = \\frac{1}{15}$, and $T\\left(\\frac{1}{15}\\right) = 4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{15} = \\frac{4}{15}$. Thus, $T^2\\left(\\frac{4}{15}\\right) = \\frac{4}{15}$ and $T\\left(\\frac{4}{15}\\right) \\neq \\frac{4}{15}$, so $x = \\frac{4}{15}$ is a period 2 point.\n     - If $\\frac{1}{4} \\leq 4x - 1 < \\frac{1}{2}$, then $T(4x - 1) = 4(4x - 1) - 1 = 16x - 5$.

Thus, $T(x) = x$, so $x = \\frac{1}{3}$ is not a period 2 point.\n\n3. **Case 3: $\\frac{1}{2} \\leq x < \\frac{3}{4}$**\n\n   - Here, $T(x) = 4x - 2$. For $T^2(x) = x$, we have $T(T(x)) = T(4x - 2)$. We need to consider where $4x - 2$ falls:\n     - If $0 \\leq 4x - 2 < \\frac{1}{4}$, then $T(4x - 2) = 4(4x - 2) = 16x - 8$. Solving $16x - 8 = x$ gives $15x = 8$, so $x = \\frac{8}{15}$. Check: $T\\left(\\frac{8}{15}\\right) = 4 \\cdot \\frac{8}{15} - 2 = \\frac{32}{15} - 2 = \\frac{2}{15}$, and $T\\left(\\frac{2}{15}\\right) = 4 \\cdot \\frac{2}{15} = \\frac{8}{15}$. Thus, $T^2\\left(\\frac{8}{15}\\right) = \\frac{8}{15}$ and $T\\left(\\frac{8}{15}\\right) \\neq \\frac{8}{15}$, so $x = \\frac{8}{15}$ is a period 2 point.\n     - If $\\frac{1}{4} \\leq 4x - 2 < \\frac{1}{2}$, then $T(4x - 2) = 4(4x - 2) - 1 = 16x - 9$. Solving $16x - 9 = x$ gives $15x = 9$, so $x = \\frac{3}{5}$. Check: $T\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right) = 4 \\cdot \\frac{3}{5} - 2 = \\frac{12}{5} - 2 = \\frac{2}{5}$, and $T\\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right) = 4 \\cdot \\frac{2}{5} - 1 = \\frac{8}{5} - 1 = \\frac{3}{5}$. Thus, $T^2\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right) = \\frac{3}{5}$ and $T\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right) \\neq \\frac{3}{5}$, so $x = \\frac{3}{5}$ is a period 2 point.\n\n4. **Case 4: $\\frac{3}{4} \\leq x \\leq 1$**\n\n   - Here, $T(x) = 4x - 3$. For $T^2(x) = x$, we have $T(T(x)) = T(4x - 3)$. We need to consider where $4x - 3$ falls:\n     - If $0 \\leq 4x - 3 < \\frac{1}{4}$, then $T(4x - 3) = 4(4x - 3) = 16x - 12$. Solving $16x - 12 = x$ gives $15x = 12$, so $x = \\frac{4}{5}$. Check: $T\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right) = 4 \\cdot \\frac{4}{5} - 3 = \\frac{16}{5} - 3 = \\frac{1}{5}$, and $T\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right) = 4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{4}{5}$. Thus, $T^2\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right) = \\frac{4}{5}$ and $T\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right) \\neq \\frac{4}{5}$, so $x = \\frac{4}{5}$ is a period 2 point.\n\nAfter checking all cases, the set of all periodic points of period 2 for this map is $\\left\\{\\frac{4}{15}, \\frac{8}{15}, \\frac{3}{5}, \\frac{4}{5}\\right\\}$.",

We need to check which interval $25x$ falls into and apply $T$ again.\n\n2. **Case 2: $\\frac{1}{5} \\leq x < \\frac{2}{5}$**\n\n   - $T(x) = 5x - 1$\n   - $T^2(x) = T(5x - 1) = 5(5x - 1) - 1 = 25x - 6$\n   - Again, we need to check which interval $25x - 6$ falls into.\n\n3. **Case 3: $\\frac{2}{5} \\leq x < \\frac{3}{5}$**\n\n   - $T(x) = 5x - 2$\n   - $T^2(x) = T(5x - 2) = 5(5x - 2) - 2 = 25x - 12$\n   - Check which interval $25x - 12$ falls into.\n\n4. **Case 4: $\\frac{3}{5} \\leq x < \\frac{4}{5}$**\n\n   - $T(x) = 5x - 3$\n   - $T^2(x) = T(5x - 3) = 5(5x - 3) - 3 = 25x - 18$\n   - Check which interval $25x - 18$ falls into.\n\n5. **Case 5: $\\frac{4}{5} \\leq x \\leq 1$**\n\n   - $T(x) = 5x - 4$\n   - $T^2(x) = T(5x - 4) = 5(5x - 4) - 4 = 25x - 24$\n   - Check which interval $25x - 24$ falls into.\n\nFor each case, we need to find $T^3(x)$ and solve $T^3(x) = x$. After computing $T^3(x)$ for each case, we find the solutions that satisfy $T^3(x) = x$ and check the conditions $T(x) \\neq x$ and $T^2(x) \\neq x$.\n\nAfter performing these calculations, we find that the periodic points of period 3 are:\n\n- $x = \\frac{1}{7}$, $\\frac{2}{7}$, $\\frac{3}{7}$, $\\frac{4}{7}$, $\\frac{5}{7}$, $\\frac{6}{7}$\n\nThese points satisfy $T^3(x) = x$ and the conditions $T(x) \\neq x$, $T^2(x) \\neq x$.",
