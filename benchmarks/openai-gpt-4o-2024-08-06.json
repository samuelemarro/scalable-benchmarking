Since $f$ is order-preserving, for each $a \\in A$, $f(\\bigwedge A) \\leq f(a) = a$ because $f(a) = a$ for all $a \\in A$.\n   - Therefore, $f(\\bigwedge A) \\leq \\bigwedge A$.\n   - Since $f$ is order-preserving and $f(\\bigwedge A) \\leq \\bigwedge A$, we have $f(f(\\bigwedge A)) \\leq f(\\bigwedge A)$.\n   - But $f(f(\\bigwedge A)) = f(\\bigwedge A)$ because $f$ is a function on $L$.\n   - Thus, $f(\\bigwedge A) = \\bigwedge A$, showing that $\\bigwedge A \\in F$.\n\n3. **Closure under joins:**\n   - Consider the join $\\bigvee A$ in $L$. For each $a \\in A$, $a \\leq \\bigvee A$, so $f(a) \\leq f(\\bigvee A)$.\n   - Since $f(a) = a$ for all $a \\in A$, we have $a \\leq f(\\bigvee A)$ for all $a \\in A$.\n   - Therefore, $\\bigvee A \\leq f(\\bigvee A)$.\n   - Since $f$ is order-preserving and $\\bigvee A \\leq f(\\bigvee A)$, we have $f(\\bigvee A) \\leq f(f(\\bigvee A)) = f(\\bigvee A)$.\n   - Thus, $f(\\bigvee A) = \\bigvee A$, showing that $\\bigvee A \\in F$.\n\n4. **Completeness:**\n   - Since $F$ is closed under arbitrary meets and joins, it is a complete sublattice of $L$.\n\nTherefore, the set of fixed points $F$ is a complete sublattice of $L$.",

However, let's verify this further by checking other products:\n\n- $e_1 e_2 = e_3$ and $e_2 e_1 = -e_3$, which satisfies anticommutativity.\n- $e_2 e_2 = e_1$, but $e_2 e_2$ should be $-e_2 e_2$, which is not possible unless $e_1 = 0$.\n- $e_3 e_1 = e_1$ and $e_1 e_3$ is not defined, but for anticommutativity, $e_1 e_3 = -e_3 e_1 = -e_1$, which is not given.\n- $e_3 e_2 = e_2$ and $e_2 e_3$ is not defined, but for anticommutativity, $e_2 e_3 = -e_3 e_2 = -e_2$, which is not given.\n- $e_3 e_3 = e_3$, but $e_3 e_3$ should be $-e_3 e_3$, which is not possible unless $e_3 = 0$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe algebra $A$ does not satisfy the anticommutativity property required for a Lie algebra. Therefore, $A$ is not a Lie algebra.\n\nSince $A$ is not a Lie algebra, we do not need to check the Jacobi identity or find the dimension of its center. The failure of anticommutativity is sufficient to conclude that $A$ is not a Lie algebra.",

Define $v(x, y) = x^2 + y^2$, so $u(x, y) = \\log \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - v(x, y)} \\right)$.\n\nThe partial derivatives of $u$ are:\n\n1. $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\log \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - v(x, y)} \\right) = \\frac{1}{1 - v(x, y)} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( -v(x, y) \\right) = \\frac{2x}{1 - (x^2 + y^2)}$.\n\n2. $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = \\frac{d}{dy} \\log \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - v(x, y)} \\right) = \\frac{1}{1 - v(x, y)} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left( -v(x, y) \\right) = \\frac{2y}{1 - (x^2 + y^2)}$.\n\nNext, compute the second partial derivatives:\n\n1. $\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( \\frac{2x}{1 - (x^2 + y^2)} \\right) = \\frac{2(1 - (x^2 + y^2)) - 2x(2x)}{(1 - (x^2 + y^2))^2} = \\frac{2 - 2x^2 - 2y^2}{(1 - (x^2 + y^2))^2}$.\n\n2. $\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left( \\frac{2y}{1 - (x^2 + y^2)} \\right) = \\frac{2(1 - (x^2 + y^2)) - 2y(2y)}{(1 - (x^2 + y^2))^2} = \\frac{2 - 2x^2 - 2y^2}{(1 - (x^2 + y^2))^2}$.\n\nAdding these, we find:\n\n$$ \\Delta u = \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} = \\frac{2 - 2x^2 - 2y^2}{(1 - (x^2 + y^2))^2} + \\frac{2 - 2x^2 - 2y^2}{(1 - (x^2 + y^2))^2} = 0. $$\n\nThus, $u$ is harmonic on $D$.\n\nTo determine if $u$ can be extended to a harmonic function on $\\overline{D}$, consider the behavior of $u$ as $|z| \\to 1$. As $|z| \\to 1$, $1 - |z|^2 \\to 0^+$, and thus $u(z) = \\log \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - |z|^2} \\right) \\to \\infty$. Therefore, $u$ cannot be extended to a harmonic function on the closed unit disk $\\overline{D}$ because it becomes unbounded as $|z| \\to 1$.",

A point $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is a limit point of $A$ if every open interval $(x - \\epsilon, x + \\epsilon)$ for $\\epsilon > 0$ contains a point of $A$ different from $x$. \n\nSince the sequence $\\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right)$ converges to $0$, for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists an $N \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that for all $n \\geq N$, $\\frac{1}{n} < \\epsilon$. Thus, $0$ is a limit point of $A$.\n\nNow, consider any point $x > 0$. For $x$ to be a limit point of $A$, every open interval $(x - \\epsilon, x + \\epsilon)$ must contain a point of $A$. However, since $A$ consists of positive numbers that get arbitrarily small, for sufficiently small $\\epsilon$, the interval $(x - \\epsilon, x + \\epsilon)$ will not contain any points of $A$ if $x$ is not $0$. Therefore, no $x > 0$ can be a limit point of $A$.\n\nSince $A$ is a subset of $\\mathbb{R}$ and $0$ is a limit point of $A$, the closure $\\overline{A}$ is the union of $A$ and its limit points. Therefore, $\\overline{A} = A \\cup \\{0\\}$.\n\nThus, the closure of $A$ in $\\mathbb{R}$ is $\\overline{A} = \\{0\\} \\cup \\{ \\frac{1}{n} \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\}$.",

Trapezoidal Rule:**\n\nThe Trapezoidal Rule for approximating the integral $\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \\, dx$ with $n$ subintervals is given by:\n\n$$ T_n = \\frac{b-a}{2n} \\left[ f(x_0) + 2 \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} f(x_i) + f(x_n) \\right], $$\n\nwhere $x_i = a + i \\frac{b-a}{n}$ for $i = 0, 1, \\ldots, n$.\n\nFor $I = \\int_{0}^{1} e^{-x^2} \\, dx$ with $n = 4$, we have $a = 0$, $b = 1$, and $h = \\frac{1-0}{4} = 0.25$. The points are $x_0 = 0$, $x_1 = 0.25$, $x_2 = 0.5$, $x_3 = 0.75$, and $x_4 = 1$.\n\nCalculate $f(x_i)$ for each $x_i$:\n\n- $f(x_0) = e^{-0^2} = 1$,\n- $f(x_1) = e^{-(0.25)^2} = e^{-0.0625} \\approx 0.93941306$,\n- $f(x_2) = e^{-(0.5)^2} = e^{-0.25} \\approx 0.77880078$,\n- $f(x_3) = e^{-(0.75)^2} = e^{-0.5625} \\approx 0.56978282$,\n- $f(x_4) = e^{-(1)^2} = e^{-1} \\approx 0.36787944$.\n\nNow apply the Trapezoidal Rule:\n\n$$ T_4 = \\frac{1-0}{2 \\times 4} \\left[ 1 + 2(0.93941306 + 0.77880078 + 0.56978282) + 0.36787944 \\right]. $$\n\n$$ T_4 = \\frac{1}{8} \\left[ 1 + 2(2.28799666) + 0.36787944 \\right]. $$\n\n$$ T_4 = \\frac{1}{8} \\left[ 1 + 4.57599332 + 0.36787944 \\right]. $$\n\n$$ T_4 = \\frac{1}{8} \\times 5.94387276 \\approx 0.74298409. $$\n\n**2. Simpson's Rule:**\n\nSimpson's Rule for approximating the integral $\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \\, dx$ with $n$ subintervals (where $n$ is even) is given by:\n\n$$ S_n = \\frac{b-a}{3n} \\left[ f(x_0) + 4 \\sum_{\\text{odd } i} f(x_i) + 2 \\sum_{\\text{even } i} f(x_i) + f(x_n) \\right]. $$\n\nFor $n = 4$, we have the same $x_i$ and $f(x_i)$ as before.\n\nApply Simpson's Rule:\n\n$$ S_4 = \\frac{1-0}{3 \\times 4} \\left[ 1 + 4(0.93941306 + 0.56978282) + 2(0.77880078) + 0.36787944 \\right]. $$\n\n$$ S_4 = \\frac{1}{12} \\left[ 1 + 4(1.50919588) + 2(0.77880078) + 0.36787944 \\right]. $$\n\n$$ S_4 = \\frac{1}{12} \\left[ 1 + 6.03678352 + 1.55760156 + 0.36787944 \\right]. $$\n\n$$ S_4 = \\frac{1}{12} \\times 8.96226452 \\approx 0.74685538. $$\n\n**3. Comparison:**\n\nThe Trapezoidal Rule approximation is $T_4 \\approx 0.74298409$, and the Simpson's Rule approximation is $S_4 \\approx 0.74685538$.\n\nSimpson's Rule is generally more accurate than the Trapezoidal Rule for the same number of subintervals because it uses quadratic polynomials to approximate the function, which can better capture the curvature of the function $e^{-x^2}$ over the interval. Therefore, $S_4$ is likely to be closer to the true value of the integral than $T_4$.",
