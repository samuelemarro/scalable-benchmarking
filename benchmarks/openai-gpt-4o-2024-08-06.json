Let $P(x)$ be a predicate over a domain $D$, and let $a$ and $b$ be specific elements of $D$. The axioms and rules are as follows:\n\n1. Axiom 1: $\\forall x \\in D, P(x) \\rightarrow Q(x)$\n2. Axiom 2: $P(a)$\n3. Axiom 3: $\\neg Q(b)$\n4. Rule of Inference: Modus Ponens - From $A \\rightarrow B$ and $A$, infer $B$.\n\nProve or disprove: $a \\neq b$.",
            "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given axioms and apply logical reasoning to determine whether $a \\neq b$.\n\n1. **Axiom 1** states that for every element $x$ in the domain $D$, if $P(x)$ is true, then $Q(x)$ is also true. Symbolically, this is $\\forall x \\in D, P(x) \\rightarrow Q(x)$.\n\n2. **Axiom 2** states that $P(a)$ is true.\n\n3. **Axiom 3** states that $Q(b)$ is false, i.e., $\\neg Q(b)$.\n\n4. **Rule of Inference (Modus Ponens)** allows us to infer $Q(a)$ from $P(a)$ and $P(x) \\rightarrow Q(x)$.\n\nLet's apply these axioms and rules:\n\n- From **Axiom 2** ($P(a)$) and **Axiom 1** ($\\forall x \\in D, P(x) \\rightarrow Q(x)$), we can use Modus Ponens to infer $Q(a)$. Therefore, $Q(a)$ is true.\n\n- **Axiom 3** tells us that $Q(b)$ is false.\n\nNow, we have:\n- $Q(a)$ is true.\n- $Q(b)$ is false.\n\nSince $Q(a)$ is true and $Q(b)$ is false, it follows that $a$ and $b$ cannot be the same element. If $a = b$, then $Q(a)$ and $Q(b)$ would have to be the same, which leads to a contradiction because $Q(a)$ is true and $Q(b)$ is false.\n\nTherefore, we conclude that $a \\neq b$.\n\nThus, the statement $a \\neq b$ is proven to be true based on the given axioms and rules.\n\n[ANSWER]\nThe statement $a \\neq b$ is true.",
