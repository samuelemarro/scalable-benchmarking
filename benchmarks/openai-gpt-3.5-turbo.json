        "question": "### Problem:  Given a positive integer $N$, define a \"sum-of-digit factorial\" function $F(N)$ as follows:\n1. Calculate the sum of the digits of $N$.\n2. Compute the factorial of this sum.\n3. Continue until a single-digit number is obtained.\n\nFor example, with $N = 49$:\n- Sum of digits: $4 + 9 = 13$\n- Factorial of sum: $13! = 6227020800$\n- Since this is not a single-digit number, we repeat the process:\n  - Sum of digits: $6 + 2 + 2 + 7 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 27$\n  - Factorial of sum: $27! = 10888869450418352160768000000$\n\nWe now have a single-digit number, so $F(49) = 7$.\n\nGiven this definition, determine the two-digit number $N$ such that $F(N) = 4$.",
        "answer": "The key observation in solving this problem is to understand that the factorial of a number grows very rapidly. This property allows us to work backward, starting from the desired single-digit result and deducing the corresponding original number.\n\nLet's start by considering potential factorial values that would lead to $4$ after digit summing:\n- Factorial $3! = 6$: As $\\log_{10}(6) \\approx 0.7782$, this won't lead to a single digit after summing.\n- Factorial $4! = 24$: The logarithm value is about $1.3802$, giving a sum of $6$.\n- Factorial $5! = 120$: The logarithm is approximately $2.0792$, resulting in a sum of $3$.\n- Factorial $6! = 720$: The logarithm is close to $2.8573$, leading to a sum of $4$.\n\nThus, $F(720) = 4$, and this corresponds to the two-digit number $\\boxed{72}$ as the solution."

        "question": "### Problem:  \n\nLet $n$ be a positive integer greater than $1$, and let $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$ be the distinct prime factors of $n$. Define $s_k$ as the sum of all possible products of $k$ distinct $p_i$'s, for $k=1, 2, \\ldots, n$. \n\nProve that the sequence $s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_n$ can be written as a polynomial in terms of $n$.",
        "answer": "To prove the sequence $s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_n$ can be expressed as a polynomial in terms of $n$, we will first establish some key observations and then derive the polynomial expression.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n1. By the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, every positive integer greater than $1$ can be uniquely factored into a product of prime numbers.\n2. Given the distinct prime factors $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$ of $n$, any product of these primes can be expressed as $p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \\cdots p_n^{e_n}$, where each $e_i$ can be $0$ or $1$.\n3. The sum of all such products is equivalent to the sum of the products of all possible subsets of distinct primes, which leads to the sequence $s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_n$.\n\n**Derivation:**\nLet $P(x) = (1 + p_1x)(1 + p_2x) \\cdots (1 + p_nx)$ represent the generating function of the sequence $s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_n$. The coefficient of $x^k$ in $P(x)$ gives $s_k$.\n\nExpanding $P(x)$, we get:\n$P(x) = 1 + (p_1 + p_2 + \\cdots + p_n)x + \\sum p_ip_j x^2 + \\cdots + p_1p_2\\ldots p_n x^n$\n\nSince we are interested in the coefficient of $x^k$ for $k=1, 2, \\ldots, n$, we notice that this can be expressed as a symmetric polynomial of the sums of products of all possible subsets of primes up to $n$. \n\nHence, $s_k$ can indeed be written as a polynomial in terms of $n$ for $k=1, 2, \\ldots, n$, completing the proof.\n\nTherefore, the sequence $s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_n$ can be expressed as a polynomial in terms of $n$."

        "question": "### Problem:\nLet $f(x)$ be a continuous and differentiable function on the closed interval $[0, 1]$ such that $f(0) = f(1)$. Show that there exist distinct real numbers $a, b \\in [0, 1]$ such that $f(a) = f(b)$ and $f'(a) = f'(b)$.",
        "answer": "To prove this statement, consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Define a New Function:**\n   Let $g(x) = f(x) - f(x-1)$ for $x \\in (0, 1]$ with periodic extension for $x = 0$ ($g(0) = g(1)$).\n\n2. **Use Intermediate Value Theorem:**\n    - Since $g(x)$ is continuous on $[0, 1]$, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there exist $a$ and $b$ in $(0, 1]$ such that $g(a) = g(b) = 0$.\n\n3. **Analyze the Derivative of $g(x)$:**\n    - For $x \\in (0, 1]$, we have $g'(x) = f'(x) - f'(x-1)$.\n    - Note that $f'(x)$ is continuous due to the differentiability of $f(x)$ in $[0, 1]$, so $g'(x)$ exists and is continuous as well.\n\n4. **Utilize Mean Value Theorem:**\n    - Apply the Mean Value Theorem for the function $g(x)$ on the interval $[a, b]$ to get $g'(c) = 0$ for some $c \\in (a, b)$.\n\n5. **Connect Back to $f(x)$:**\n    - Since $g(x) = f(x) - f(x-1)$ and $g'(c) = f'(c) - f'(c-1) = 0$, this implies $f'(c) = f'(c-1)$.\n    \n6. **Obtain the Desired Result:**\n    - Therefore, there exist distinct real numbers $a, b \\in [0, 1]$ such that $f(a) = f(b)$ and $f'(a) = f'(b)$.\n\nHence, we have shown that for a continuous and differentiable function $f(x)$ on $[0, 1]$ with $f(0) = f(1)$, there are distinct $a$ and $b$ in $[0, 1]$ such that $f(a) = f(b)$ and $f'(a) = f'(b$.\n\n[NOTE]\nThis problem demonstrates the fundamental theorem of calculus and the application of intermediate and mean value theorems. The concept of transforming the function through differences is key to simplifying the analysis of derivatives."
