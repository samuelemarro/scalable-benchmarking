            "answer": "To prove that there exist infinitely many prime numbers, we will assume the opposite, i.e., there are only finitely many prime numbers. Let's denote these prime numbers as $p_1, p_2, ..., p_n$, where $n$ is a finite number.\n\nNow, consider the number $N = p_1 \\cdot p_2 \\cdot ... \\cdot p_n + 1$. This number is greater than any of the prime numbers $p_1, p_2, ..., p_n$.\n\nSince $N$ is greater than any of the known prime numbers, it must either be a prime number itself or have a prime factor that is different from all the known prime numbers. \n\nIf $N$ is prime, then we have found a prime number greater than any of the known prime numbers, which contradicts our assumption that there are only finitely many prime numbers.\n\nIf $N$ is not prime, then it must have a prime factor $p$ that is different from all the known prime numbers. This new prime factor $p$ would also contradict our assumption that there are only finitely many prime numbers.\n\nTherefore, our assumption that there are only finitely many prime numbers must be false. Hence, there exist infinitely many prime numbers.",

            "answer": "To solve this problem, we can approach it using a recursive method combined with dynamic programming.\n\nLet's define a function $f(n)$ as the number of valid colorings of an $n \\times n$ grid. We will start by calculating $f(1)$ and $f(2)$ manually:\n\n- For $f(1)$, there are 2 ways to color a single cell (either black or white).\n- For $f(2)$, there are 2 ways to color the first row. For the second row, we need to ensure that no cell has the same color as its upper neighbor. So, there are 2 ways to color the second row. Therefore, $f(2) = 2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n\nNow, we can establish a recursive formula for $f(n)$ for $n \\geq 3$. Let's consider the first row of the grid:\n\n- The first cell can be colored in 2 ways.\n- The second cell can be colored in 2 ways.\n- For the third cell onwards, each cell must have a different color than its left neighbor. So, there are 2 ways to color each of these cells.\n\nTherefore, for each row after the first row, there are $2 \\times 2^{n-2} = 2^{n-1}$ ways to color the row.\n\nHence, the total number of valid colorings for an $n \\times n$ grid is given by the recursive formula:\n\n$$ f(n) = \\begin{cases} 2 & \\text{if } n = 1 \\\\ 4 & \\text{if } n = 2 \\\\ 2 \\times 2^{n-1} & \\text{if } n \\geq 3 \\end{cases} $$\n\nTherefore, for a 10x10 grid, the number of ways to color the cells such that no two adjacent cells share the same color is $f(10) = 2 \\times 2^9 = 2 \\times 512 = 1024$.",

            "answer": "To prove that $p^2 - 1$ is always divisible by 24 for a prime number $p > 3$, we can use the fact that any prime number greater than 3 can be expressed in the form $6k \\pm 1$ for some integer $k \\geq 1$.\n\nGiven that $p$ is a prime number greater than 3, we can express it as $p = 6k \\pm 1$ for some integer $k \\geq 1$.\n\nNow, let's calculate $p^2 - 1$:\n$$ p^2 - 1 = (6k \\pm 1)^2 - 1 $$\n$$ = 36k^2 \\pm 12k + 1 - 1 $$\n$$ = 36k^2 \\pm 12k $$\n\nSince $36k^2$ is divisible by 24 for any integer $k$, we only need to consider the term $\\pm 12k$.\n\nIf $p = 6k + 1$, then $p^2 - 1 = 36k^2 + 12k$. Since $12k$ is divisible by 24, $p^2 - 1$ is also divisible by 24.\n\nIf $p = 6k - 1$, then $p^2 - 1 = 36k^2 - 12k$.
