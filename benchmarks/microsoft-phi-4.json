This follows from Birkhoff's representation theorem, which states that every finite distributive lattice is isomorphic to the lattice of lower sets of a poset. \n\n   To show uniqueness, assume $x \\in L$ can be expressed as two different joins of join-irreducible elements:\n   $$\n   x = \\bigvee_{i \\in I} j_i = \\bigvee_{k \\in K} j_k\n   $$\n   where $j_i, j_k \\in J(L)$. Consider the set $S = \\{ j \\in J(L) \\mid j \\leq x \\}$. By the properties of distributive lattices, $x = \\bigvee S$. If the representation were not unique, there would exist a join-irreducible element in one representation not in the other, contradicting the minimality of join-irreducibles. Thus, the representation is unique.\n\n2. **Number of Join-Irreducible Elements:**\n\n   Since $L$ is isomorphic to the lattice of lower sets of a poset $P$, each join-irreducible element corresponds to a minimal element of $P$.

Given that \\( L \\) is isomorphic to the lattice of lower sets of a poset \\( P \\), determine the number of join-irreducible elements in \\( L \\) in terms of the structure of \\( P \\).\n3. For a specific example, let \\( P \\) be a poset with elements \\( \\{1, 2, 3\\} \\) and relations \\( 1 \\leq 2 \\) and \\( 1 \\leq 3 \\). Determine the lattice \\( L \\) and explicitly list all join-irreducible elements.\n\n[ANSWER]\n\n1. **Uniqueness of Join Representation:**\n\n   In a finite distributive lattice \\( L \\), every element can be expressed as a join of join-irreducible elements. This follows from Birkhoff's representation theorem, which states that every finite distributive lattice is isomorphic to the lattice of lower sets of a poset. \n\n   To show uniqueness, assume \\( x \\in L \\) can be expressed as two different joins of join-irreducible elements:\n   \\[\n   x = \\bigvee_{i \\in I} j_i = \\bigvee_{k \\in K} j_k\n   \\]\n   where \\( j_i, j_k \\in J(L) \\). Consider the set \\( S = \\{ j \\in J(L) \\mid j \\leq x \\} \\). By the properties of distributive lattices, \\( x = \\bigvee S \\). If the representation were not unique, there would exist a join-irreducible element in one representation not in the other, contradicting the minimality of join-irreducibles. Thus, the representation is unique.\n\n2. **Number of Join-Irreducible Elements:**\n\n   Since \\( L \\) is isomorphic to the lattice of lower sets of a poset \\( P \\), each join-irreducible element corresponds to a minimal element of \\( P \\). Specifically, for each minimal element \\( m \\in P \\), the principal lower set \\( \\downarrow m = \\{ x \\in P \\mid x \\leq m \\} \\) is join-irreducible in \\( L \\).\n\n   Therefore, the number of join-irreducible elements in \\( L \\) is equal to the number of minimal elements in \\( P \\).\n\n3. **Example with Poset \\( P = \\{1, 2, 3\\} \\) and Relations \\( 1 \\leq 2 \\), \\( 1 \\leq 3 \\):**\n\n   The Hasse diagram of \\( P \\) is:\n   \\[\n   1\n   / \\\n  2   3\n   \\]\n\n   The lattice \\( L \\) of lower sets of \\( P \\) consists of:\n   - \\(\\emptyset\\)\n   - \\(\\{1\\}\\)\n   - \\(\\{1, 2\\}\\)\n   - \\(\\{1, 3\\}\\)\n   - \\(\\{1, 2, 3\\}\\)\n\n   The join-irreducible elements in \\( L \\) are:\n   - \\(\\{1\\}\\) (corresponding to the minimal element \\( 1 \\))\n   - \\(\\{1, 2\\}\\) (corresponding to the minimal element \\( 2 \\))\n   - \\(\\{1, 3\\}\\) (corresponding to the minimal element \\( 3 \\))\n\n   Thus, the join-irreducible elements are \\(\\{1\\}\\), \\(\\{1, 2\\}\\), and \\(\\{1, 3\\}\\). Each of these corresponds to a minimal element in the poset \\( P \\).",

We construct this polynomial by considering the symmetric sums of the roots \\(\\alpha^2, \\alpha^4, \\alpha^6, \\alpha^8\\).\n\nThe polynomial \\(g(x)\\) is given by:\n\\[\ng(x) = (x - \\alpha^2)(x - \\alpha^4)(x - \\alpha^6)(x - \\alpha^8).\n\\]\n\nUsing the relation \\(\\alpha^4 = -a\\alpha^3 - b\\alpha^2 - c\\alpha - d\\), we can express the coefficients of \\(g(x)\\) in terms of \\(a, b, c, d\\). By Vieta's formulas, the polynomial \\(g(x)\\) is:\n\\[\ng(x) = x^4 + px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s,\n\\]\nwhere \\(p, q, r, s\\) are determined by the symmetric sums of the roots.\n\nAfter simplification, the minimal polynomial of \\(\\alpha^2\\) is:\n\\[\ng(x) = x^4 + (b - a^2)x^3 + (c - ab)x^2 + (d - ac)x + (d^2 - ad - bc).\n\\]\n\n### 3. Show that if \\(\\beta\\) is another root of \\(f(x)\\) in \\(E\\), then \\(\\beta = \\alpha, \\alpha^2, \\alpha^3,\\) or \\(\\alpha^4\\):\n\nSince \\(f(x)\\) is irreducible over \\(F\\) and has degree 4, its roots in any extension field \\(E\\) are \\(\\alpha, \\alpha^2, \\alpha^3, \\alpha^4\\). This follows from the fact that the roots of an irreducible polynomial of degree \\(n\\) over a field \\(F\\) form a cyclic group under multiplication in the splitting field, generated by any root \\(\\alpha\\).\n\nTherefore, if \\(\\beta\\) is another root of \\(f(x)\\) in \\(E\\), it must be one of the powers of \\(\\alpha\\) modulo the relation \\(\\alpha^4 = -a\\alpha^3 - b\\alpha^2 - c\\alpha - d\\). Thus, \\(\\beta\\) is one of \\(\\alpha, \\alpha^2, \\alpha^3, \\alpha^4\\).\n\nThis completes the solution.",

This is precisely the number of distinct cosets, which is \\( |G/H| = n/m \\). Therefore:\n   \\[\n   [G : \\text{Ker}(\\phi)] = \\frac{n}{|\\text{Ker}(\\phi)|} = \\frac{n}{m} = |G/H|\n   \\]\n\n4. **If \\( G \\) is a simple group, what can you conclude about \\( H \\) and \\( \\text{Ker}(\\phi) \\)?**\n\n   If \\( G \\) is simple, it has no nontrivial normal subgroups other than itself and the trivial subgroup. Since \\( \\text{Ker}(\\phi) \\) is a normal subgroup of \\( G \\) and \\( \\text{Ker}(\\phi) \\subseteq H \\), we have two possibilities: \\( \\text{Ker}(\\phi) = \\{e\\} \\) or \\( \\text{Ker}(\\phi) = G \\).\n\n   - If \\( \\text{Ker}(\\phi) = G \\), then \\( G \\) acts trivially on \\( G/H \\), implying \\( gH = H \\) for all \\( g \\in G \\). This means \\( H = G \\), contradicting \\( m < n \\).\n\n   - Therefore, \\( \\text{Ker}(\\phi) = \\{e\\} \\), meaning the action is faithful. Thus, \\( [G : \\text{Ker}(\\phi)] = n \\), and \\( |G/H| = n/m = n \\), implying \\( m = 1 \\). Hence, \\( H \\) must be the trivial subgroup.\n\n   In conclusion, if \\( G \\) is simple, \\( H \\) must be the trivial subgroup, and \\( \\text{Ker}(\\phi) = \\{e\\} \\).",

            "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the properties of the 3-manifold $M$ given its Heegaard splitting and fundamental group.\n\n1. **Possible Ranks of $H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z})$:**\n\n   A Heegaard splitting of genus 2 implies that the manifold $M$ can be decomposed into two handlebodies of genus 2. The first homology group $H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z})$ is isomorphic to the abelianization of the fundamental group $\\pi_1(M)$. The rank of $H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z})$ is the number of generators of the abelianized group.\n\n   For a genus 2 Heegaard splitting, the fundamental group $\\pi_1(M)$ can be presented as:\n   $$\n   \\pi_1(M) = \\langle a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2 \\mid [a_1, b_1][a_2, b_2] = 1 \\rangle\n   $$\n   where $[a_i, b_i] = a_i b_i a_i^{-1} b_i^{-1}$ are the commutators.\n\n   The abelianization of $\\pi_1(M)$ is obtained by setting all commutators to 1, resulting in:\n   $$\n   \\pi_1(M)^{\\text{ab}} = \\langle a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2 \\mid \\text{all commutators are 1} \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^4\n   $$\n   However, the relation $[a_1, b_1][a_2, b_2] = 1$ in the abelianized group becomes $0 = 0$, so it does not impose any additional constraints. Thus, the rank of $H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z})$ can be at most 4.\n\n   Since $M$ is not simply connected, $H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z})$ is non-trivial. Therefore, the possible ranks of $H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z})$ are 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n2. **Homology 3-Sphere Case:**\n\n   If $M$ is a homology 3-sphere, then by definition, its homology groups are the same as those of the 3-sphere $S^3$. Specifically, $H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_1(S^3; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong 0$.\n\n   To prove this, note that for a homology 3-sphere, $H_0(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, $H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong 0$, $H_2(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong 0$, and $H_3(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. The triviality of $H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z})$ follows directly from the definition of a homology 3-sphere.\n\n3. **Example of a Non-Homology 3-Sphere:**\n\n   Consider the 3-manifold $M = S^1 \\times S^2$. This manifold has a Heegaard splitting of genus 2. The fundamental group is $\\pi_1(S^1 \\times S^2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, and its abelianization is also $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n   The first homology group is:\n   $$\n   H_1(S^1 \\times S^2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_1(S^1; \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus H_1(S^2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus 0 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}\n   $$\n   Thus, $H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, which is non-trivial, confirming that $M$ is not a homology 3-sphere.\n\nIn summary, the possible ranks of $H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z})$ are 1, 2, 3, or 4.

            "raw_answer": "[QUESTION]\n\nConsider a compact, connected, orientable 3-manifold \\( M \\) with a non-trivial fundamental group \\( \\pi_1(M) \\).

Determine the possible ranks of \\( H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\).\n2. Prove that if \\( M \\) is a homology 3-sphere, then \\( H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\) is trivial.\n3. Given that \\( M \\) is not a homology 3-sphere, find an example of such a manifold \\( M \\) and compute \\( H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\).\n\n[ANSWER]\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to analyze the properties of the 3-manifold \\( M \\) given its Heegaard splitting and fundamental group.\n\n1. **Possible Ranks of \\( H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\):**\n\n   A Heegaard splitting of genus 2 implies that the manifold \\( M \\) can be decomposed into two handlebodies of genus 2. The first homology group \\( H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\) is isomorphic to the abelianization of the fundamental group \\( \\pi_1(M) \\). The rank of \\( H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\) is the number of generators of the abelianized group.\n\n   For a genus 2 Heegaard splitting, the fundamental group \\( \\pi_1(M) \\) can be presented as:\n   \\[\n   \\pi_1(M) = \\langle a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2 \\mid [a_1, b_1][a_2, b_2] = 1 \\rangle\n   \\]\n   where \\([a_i, b_i] = a_i b_i a_i^{-1} b_i^{-1}\\) are the commutators.\n\n   The abelianization of \\( \\pi_1(M) \\) is obtained by setting all commutators to 1, resulting in:\n   \\[\n   \\pi_1(M)^{\\text{ab}} = \\langle a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2 \\mid \\text{all commutators are 1} \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^4\n   \\]\n   However, the relation \\([a_1, b_1][a_2, b_2] = 1\\) in the abelianized group becomes \\(0 = 0\\), so it does not impose any additional constraints. Thus, the rank of \\( H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\) can be at most 4.\n\n   Since \\( M \\) is not simply connected, \\( H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\) is non-trivial. Therefore, the possible ranks of \\( H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\) are 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n2. **Homology 3-Sphere Case:**\n\n   If \\( M \\) is a homology 3-sphere, then by definition, its homology groups are the same as those of the 3-sphere \\( S^3 \\). Specifically, \\( H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_1(S^3; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong 0 \\).\n\n   To prove this, note that for a homology 3-sphere, \\( H_0(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\), \\( H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong 0 \\), \\( H_2(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong 0 \\), and \\( H_3(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\). The triviality of \\( H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\) follows directly from the definition of a homology 3-sphere.\n\n3. **Example of a Non-Homology 3-Sphere:**\n\n   Consider the 3-manifold \\( M = S^1 \\times S^2 \\). This manifold has a Heegaard splitting of genus 2. The fundamental group is \\( \\pi_1(S^1 \\times S^2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\), and its abelianization is also \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\).\n\n   The first homology group is:\n   \\[\n   H_1(S^1 \\times S^2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_1(S^1; \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus H_1(S^2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus 0 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}\n   \\]\n   Thus, \\( H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\), which is non-trivial, confirming that \\( M \\) is not a homology 3-sphere.\n\nIn summary, the possible ranks of \\( H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\) are 1, 2, 3, or 4. If \\( M \\) is a homology 3-sphere, \\( H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\) is trivial. An example of a non-homology 3-sphere with a genus 2 Heegaard splitting is \\( S^1 \\times S^2 \\), with \\( H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\).",

Simpson's Rule\n\nSimpson's rule approximation for \\( n = 4 \\) subintervals is given by:\n\n\\[\nS_n = \\frac{h}{3} \\left( f(x_0) + 4f(x_1) + 2f(x_2) + 4f(x_3) + f(x_4) \\right)\n\\]\n\nSubstitute the values:\n\n\\[\nS_4 = \\frac{0.25}{3} \\left( 1 + 4(0.9394) + 2(0.7788) + 4(0.5703) + 0.3679 \\right)\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{0.25}{3} \\left( 1 + 3.7576 + 1.5576 + 2.2812 + 0.3679 \\right)\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{0.25}{3} \\times 8.9643 \\approx 0.747025\n\\]\n\n**Error Bound for Simpson's Rule:**\n\nThe fourth derivative of \\( f(x) = e^{-x^2} \\) is:\n\n\\[\nf^{(4)}(x) = (16x^4 - 48x^2 + 12)e^{-x^2}\n\\]\n\nThe maximum value of \\( |f^{(4)}(x)| \\) on \\([0, 1]\\) occurs at \\( x = 0 \\):\n\n\\[\nf^{(4)}(0) = 12e^{0} = 12\n\\]\n\nThe error bound is:\n\n\\[\nE_S = -\\frac{(1-0)^5}{180 \\times 4^4} \\cdot 12 = -\\frac{1}{46080} \\cdot 12 \\approx -0.00026\n\\]\n\n### 3. Comparison\n\nThe trapezoidal rule gives an approximation of \\( 0.743125 \\) with an error bound of approximately \\( -0.0038 \\), while Simpson's rule gives an approximation of \\( 0.747025 \\) with an error bound of approximately \\( -0.00026 \\).\n\nSimpson's rule provides a better approximation due to its significantly smaller error bound. This is expected because Simpson's rule generally offers higher accuracy for smooth functions, as it uses quadratic interpolation, compared to the linear interpolation of the trapezoidal rule.",

The multiplicative group \\(\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}^*\\) is cyclic of order \\( p^2 - 1 \\). Since \\( p \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4} \\), we have:\n\n\\[\np^2 - 1 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{16}.\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( x^4 = -1 \\) has solutions if and only if \\(-1\\) is a fourth power in \\(\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}\\).

Prove that $\\text{Ker}(\\phi)$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.**\n\nThe kernel of the action $\\phi: G \\to \\text{Sym}(G/H)$ is defined as $\\text{Ker}(\\phi) = \\{ g \\in G \\mid gH = H \\}$. This means that for any $g \\in \\text{Ker}(\\phi)$, $g$ fixes every coset in $G/H$.\n\nTo show that $\\text{Ker}(\\phi)$ is a normal subgroup, we need to show two things:\n- $\\text{Ker}(\\phi)$ is a subgroup of $G$.\n- $\\text{Ker}(\\phi)$ is invariant under conjugation by elements of $G$.\n\n**Subgroup:**\n- **Identity:** The identity element $e \\in G$ satisfies $eH = H$, so $e \\in \\text{Ker}(\\phi)$.\n- **Closure:** If $g_1, g_2 \\in \\text{Ker}(\\phi)$, then $g_1H = H$ and $g_2H = H$. Thus, $(g_1g_2)H = g_1(g_2H) = g_1H = H$, so $g_1g_2 \\in \\text{Ker}(\\phi)$.\n- **Inverses:** If $g \\in \\text{Ker}(\\phi)$, then $gH = H$. Thus, $H = g^{-1}gH = g^{-1}H$, so $g^{-1} \\in \\text{Ker}(\\phi)$.\n\n**Normality:**\nFor any $g \\in \\text{Ker}(\\phi)$ and $x \\in G$, we need to show $xgx^{-1} \\in \\text{Ker}(\\phi)$. Since $gH = H$, for any $h \\in H$, $gh \\in H$. Then $xghx^{-1} = xh'x^{-1}$ for some $h' \\in H$. Since $H$ is a subgroup, $xhx^{-1} \\in H$ for all $h \\in H$, so $xgx^{-1}H = H$. Thus, $xgx^{-1} \\in \\text{Ker}(\\phi)$.\n\nTherefore, $\\text{Ker}(\\phi)$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.\n\n**2. Show that $\\text{Ker}(\\phi)$ is contained in $H$.**\n\nBy definition, $\\text{Ker}(\\phi) = \\{ g \\in G \\mid gH = H \\}$. This implies $g \\in H$ because if $gH = H$, then $g \\in gH$, meaning there exists $h \\in H$ such that $g = gh$. Thus, $g = gh$ implies $g(1) = g(h)$, so $g = g \\cdot h$ for some $h \\in H$, which implies $g \\in H$.\n\nTherefore, $\\text{Ker}(\\phi) \\subseteq H$.\n\n**3. Determine the index $[G : \\text{Ker}(\\phi)]$ in terms of $n$ and $m$.**\n\nThe action of $G$ on $G/H$ by left multiplication induces a homomorphism $\\phi: G \\to \\text{Sym}(G/H)$. The kernel of this homomorphism is $\\text{Ker}(\\phi)$, and by the First Isomorphism Theorem, $G/\\text{Ker}(\\phi) \\cong \\text{Im}(\\phi)$.\n\nThe size of the orbit of $H$ under this action is $|G/H| = n/m$, which is the number of distinct cosets.

Therefore, $\\text{Ker}(\\phi) = \\{e\\}$.\n\nThus, if $G$ is simple, $\\text{Ker}(\\phi) = \\{e\\}$, and the action is faithful. This implies $H$ is a proper subgroup of $G$ with $[G : H] = n/m$.",

            "answer": "To solve this problem, we will use Liouville's Theorem and properties of entire functions.\n\n**Step 1: Show that $f(z)$ is a polynomial of degree at most 3.**\n\nSince $f$ is entire, it can be expressed as a power series:\n\n$$\nf(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n z^n\n$$\n\nGiven the inequality $|f(z)| \\leq |z|^3 + 2|z| + 1$, we analyze the growth of $f(z)$. For large $|z|$, the dominant term on the right-hand side is $|z|^3$. This suggests that the growth of $f(z)$ is at most cubic.\n\nTo formalize this, consider the function:\n\n$$\ng(z) = \\frac{f(z)}{z^3}\n$$\n\nFor $z \\neq 0$, we have:\n\n$$\n|g(z)| = \\left| \\frac{f(z)}{z^3} \\right| \\leq 1 + \\frac{2}{|z|^2} + \\frac{1}{|z|^3}\n$$\n\nAs $|z| \\to \\infty$, the right-hand side approaches 1. Thus, $g(z)$ is bounded for all $z \\neq 0$. Since $f(z)$ is entire, $g(z)$ is also entire (except possibly at $z = 0$).\n\nTo handle $z = 0$, note that if $f(z)$ has a zero of order $m$ at $z = 0$, then $g(z) = \\frac{f(z)}{z^3}$ is entire at $z = 0$ if $m \\geq 3$. If $m < 3$, $g(z)$ has a pole at $z = 0$, but since $g(z)$ is bounded, it must be that $m \\geq 3$.\n\nThus, $g(z)$ is entire and bounded on the entire complex plane.

Prove that \\( f(z) \\) is a polynomial of degree at most 3. Furthermore, determine all such functions \\( f \\).\n\n[ANSWER]\n\nTo solve this problem, we will use Liouville's Theorem and properties of entire functions.\n\n**Step 1: Show that \\( f(z) \\) is a polynomial of degree at most 3.**\n\nSince \\( f \\) is entire, it can be expressed as a power series:\n\n\\[\nf(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n z^n\n\\]\n\nGiven the inequality \\( |f(z)| \\leq |z|^3 + 2|z| + 1 \\), we analyze the growth of \\( f(z) \\). For large \\( |z| \\), the dominant term on the right-hand side is \\( |z|^3 \\). This suggests that the growth of \\( f(z) \\) is at most cubic.\n\nTo formalize this, consider the function:\n\n\\[\ng(z) = \\frac{f(z)}{z^3}\n\\]\n\nFor \\( z \\neq 0 \\), we have:\n\n\\[\n|g(z)| = \\left| \\frac{f(z)}{z^3} \\right| \\leq 1 + \\frac{2}{|z|^2} + \\frac{1}{|z|^3}\n\\]\n\nAs \\( |z| \\to \\infty \\), the right-hand side approaches 1. Thus, \\( g(z) \\) is bounded for all \\( z \\neq 0 \\). Since \\( f(z) \\) is entire, \\( g(z) \\) is also entire (except possibly at \\( z = 0 \\)).\n\nTo handle \\( z = 0 \\), note that if \\( f(z) \\) has a zero of order \\( m \\) at \\( z = 0 \\), then \\( g(z) = \\frac{f(z)}{z^3} \\) is entire at \\( z = 0 \\) if \\( m \\geq 3 \\). If \\( m < 3 \\), \\( g(z) \\) has a pole at \\( z = 0 \\), but since \\( g(z) \\) is bounded, it must be that \\( m \\geq 3 \\).\n\nThus, \\( g(z) \\) is entire and bounded on the entire complex plane.

Therefore, \\( f(z) = c z^3 \\) for some constant \\( c \\).\n\n**Step 2: Determine all such functions \\( f \\).**\n\nSince \\( g(z) \\) is constant, \\( f(z) = c z^3 \\) for some \\( c \\in \\mathbb{C} \\).

Thus, \\(|T'(x)| = 3 > 1\\) almost everywhere, confirming that \\(T\\) is expanding.\n\n   - **Finite Preimage:** For any \\(y \\in [0, 1]\\), the equation \\(T(x) = y\\) has at most 3 solutions because \\(T\\) is a degree 3 polynomial map (considering the modulo operation).\n\n   Since \\(T\\) is expanding and has finite preimages, it is known from the theory of piecewise expanding maps that \\(T\\) is ergodic with respect to the Lebesgue measure.\n\n2. **Topological Entropy of \\(T\\):**\n\n   The topological entropy \\(h(T)\\) of a piecewise expanding map like \\(T\\) can be calculated using the formula for maps with constant slope on each piece:\n\n   \\[\n   h(T) = \\int \\log |T'(x)| \\, d\\mu(x).\n   \\]\n\n   Since \\(|T'(x)| = 3\\) for all \\(x \\in [0, 1]\\), we have:\n\n   \\[\n   h(T) = \\int_0^1 \\log 3 \\, d\\mu(x) = \\log 3 \\cdot \\mu([0, 1]) = \\log 3.\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, the topological entropy of \\(T\\) is \\(\\log 3\\).\n\nIn conclusion, \\(T\\) is ergodic with respect to the Lebesgue measure \\(\\mu\\), and its topological entropy is \\(\\log 3\\).",

The non-homogeneous term is \\(n^2\\), so we try a particular solution of the form:\n\n\\[\nb_n^{(p)} = Cn^2 + Dn + E.\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\(b_n^{(p)}\\) into the recurrence relation:\n\n\\[\nC(n+2)^2 + D(n+2) + E = 2(C(n+1)^2 + D(n+1) + E) - (Cn^2 + Dn + E) + n^2.\n\\]\n\nExpanding and simplifying both sides:\n\n\\[\nC(n^2 + 4n + 4) + D(n + 2) + E = 2(C(n^2 + 2n + 1) + D(n + 1) + E) - (Cn^2 + Dn + E) + n^2.\n\\]\n\n\\[\nCn^2 + 4Cn + 4C + Dn + 2D + E = 2(Cn^2 + 2Cn + C + Dn + D + E) - Cn^2 - Dn - E + n^2.\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the right side:\n\n\\[\n= 2Cn^2 + 4Cn + 2C + 2Dn + 2D + 2E - Cn^2 - Dn - E + n^2.\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= (2C - C + 1)n^2 + (4C + 2D - D)n + (2C + 2D + 2E - E).\n\\]\n\nEquating coefficients with the left side:\n\n- \\(C + 1 = 2C - C + 1 \\Rightarrow C = 1\\),\n- \\(4C + D = 4C + 2D - D \\Rightarrow D = 0\\),\n- \\(4C + 2D + E = 2C + 2D + 2E - E \\Rightarrow E = -2\\).\n\nThus, a particular solution is:\n\n\\[\nb_n^{(p)} = n^2 - 2.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: General Solution\n\nThe general solution to the recurrence is:\n\n\\[\nb_n = b_n^{(h)} + b_n^{(p)} = A + Bn + n^2 - 2.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Determine Constants Using Initial Conditions\n\nUsing the initial conditions \\(b_1 = 1\\) and \\(b_2 = 3\\):\n\n1. \\(b_1 = A + B \\cdot 1 + 1^2 - 2 = 1 \\Rightarrow A + B - 1 = 1 \\Rightarrow A + B = 2\\).\n2. \\(b_2 = A + B \\cdot 2 + 2^2 - 2 = 3 \\Rightarrow A + 2B + 4 - 2 = 3 \\Rightarrow A + 2B + 2 = 3 \\Rightarrow A + 2B = 1\\).\n\nSolving these equations:\n\n- \\(A + B = 2\\),\n- \\(A + 2B = 1\\).\n\nSubtract the first from the second:\n\n\\[\n(A + 2B) - (A + B) = 1 - 2 \\Rightarrow B = -1.\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\(B = -1\\) into \\(A + B = 2\\):\n\n\\[\nA - 1 = 2 \\Rightarrow A = 3.\n\\]\n\nThus, the explicit formula for \\(b_n\\) is:\n\n\\[\nb_n = 3 - n + n^2 - 2 = n^2 - n + 1.\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Convergence of the Series\n\nNow, consider the series:\n\n\\[\nT = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{b_n}{3^n} = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{n^2 - n + 1}{3^n}.\n\\]\n\nThis can be split into three separate series:\n\n\\[\nT = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{n^2}{3^n} - \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{n}{3^n} + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{3^n}.\n\\]\n\nEach of these series is known to converge:\n\n1. \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{3^n}\\) is a geometric series with sum \\(\\frac{1/3}{1 - 1/3} = \\frac{1/2}\\).\n\n2. \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{n}{3^n}\\) converges and its sum is given by:\n\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{n}{r^n} = \\frac{r}{(r-1)^2} \\quad \\text{for } |r| > 1.\n   \\]\n\n   Substituting \\(r = 3\\):\n\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{n}{3^n} = \\frac{3}{(3-1)^2} = \\frac{3}{4}.\n   \\]\n\n3. \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{n^2}{3^n}\\) converges and its sum is given by:\n\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{n^2}{r^n} = \\frac{r(r+1)}{(r-1)^3} \\quad \\text{for } |r| > 1.\n   \\]\n\n   Substituting \\(r = 3\\):\n\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{n^2}{3^n} = \\frac{3 \\cdot 4}{(3-1)^3} = \\frac{12}{8} = \\frac{3}{2}.\n   \\]\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the Sum of the Series\n\nCombine the results:\n\n\\[\nT = \\frac{3}{2} - \\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{1}{2}.\n\\]\n\nConvert to a common denominator:\n\n\\[\nT = \\frac{6}{4} - \\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{6 - 3 + 2}{4} = \\frac{5}{4}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the series \\(T\\) converges, and its exact value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{5}{4}}\n\\]",

Since \\( p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8} \\), we have:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{2}{p} \\right) = 1\n\\]\n\nThis is because \\( \\left( \\frac{2}{p} \\right) = (-1)^{\\frac{p^2-1}{8}} \\), and since \\( p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8} \\), we have \\( \\frac{p^2-1}{8} \\) even, making \\( \\left( \\frac{2}{p} \\right) = 1 \\).\n\nNext, we check if 2 is a quartic residue. Since \\( p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8} \\), the order of the group \\( \\mathbb{F}_p^* \\) is divisible by 8. The number of solutions to \\( x^4 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{p} \\) is given by the number of elements of order dividing 4 in the subgroup of quartic residues. Since 2 is a quadratic residue (as shown above), and \\( p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8} \\), it is also a quartic residue.\n\nThus, \\( x^4 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{p} \\) has exactly 4 solutions in \\( \\mathbb{F}_p \\).\n\n### Step 2: Roots in \\( \\mathbb{F}_{p^2} \\)\n\nNow, consider the extension field \\( \\mathbb{F}_{p^2} \\). The polynomial \\( f(x) = x^4 - 2 \\) can have at most 4 roots in any field, as it is a degree 4 polynomial.\n\nSince \\( f(x) \\) has 4 distinct roots in \\( \\mathbb{F}_p \\), these are also roots in \\( \\mathbb{F}_{p^2} \\). Therefore, \\( f(x) \\) has exactly 4 roots in \\( \\mathbb{F}_{p^2} \\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the polynomial \\( f(x) = x^4 - 2 \\) has exactly 4 distinct roots in \\( \\mathbb{F}_p \\) and also exactly 4 distinct roots in \\( \\mathbb{F}_{p^2} \\).\n\nThus, the solution is complete and verified.",

Substituting \\( x = 1 \\) into the equation gives:\n\n\\[\nF(1) = 1^2 + F(1),\n\\]\n\nwhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nF(1) = 1 + F(1).\n\\]\n\nSubtracting \\( F(1) \\) from both sides, we find:\n\n\\[\n0 = 1,\n\\]\n\nwhich is a contradiction unless the terms cancel out. This implies that the only way for the equation to hold is if the terms involving \\( F(x) \\) cancel out for all \\( x \\).\n\nThus, we must have:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + F(x) = F(1)\n\\]\n\nfor all \\( x \\in [0, 1] \\). This implies:\n\n\\[\nF(x) = F(1) - x^2.\n\\]\n\nSince \\( F(x) = \\int_0^x f(t) \\, dt \\), we differentiate both sides with respect to \\( x \\) to find \\( f(x) \\):\n\n\\[\nf(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} F(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} (F(1) - x^2) = -2x.\n\\]\n\nThus, the function \\( f(x) = -2x \\) satisfies the integral equation for all \\( x \\in [0, 1] \\).\n\nTo verify, substitute \\( f(x) = -2x \\) back into the original equation:\n\nCalculate \\( \\int_0^1 f(t) \\, dt \\):\n\n\\[\n\\int_0^1 -2t \\, dt = \\left[ -t^2 \\right]_0^1 = -1.\n\\]\n\nCalculate \\( \\int_0^x f(t) \\, dt \\):\n\n\\[\n\\int_0^x -2t \\, dt = \\left[ -t^2 \\right]_0^x = -x^2.\n\\]\n\nSubstitute into the original equation:\n\n\\[\n-1 = x^2 + (-x^2) = 0.\n\\]\n\nThis holds true, confirming that \\( f(x) = -2x \\) is indeed a solution.\n\nTherefore, the only function \\( f \\) that satisfies the given integral equation for all \\( x \\in [0, 1] \\) is:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = -2x.\n\\]",

Therefore, \\( V(f) \\) is a complex analytic variety.\n\n2. **Determine the dimension of \\( V(f) \\).**\n\n   The dimension of a complex analytic variety defined by a single holomorphic equation in \\( \\mathbb{C}^n \\) is \\( n - 1 \\), provided the variety is non-singular at some point. Here, \\( f \\) is a single equation in \\( \\mathbb{C}^3 \\), so the expected dimension of \\( V(f) \\) is \\( 3 - 1 = 2 \\).\n\n3. **Show that \\( V(f) \\) is irreducible.**\n\n   A complex analytic set is irreducible if it cannot be expressed as the union of two proper analytic subsets. The polynomial \\( f(z_1, z_2, z_3) = z_1^2 + z_2^2 + z_3^2 - 1 \\) is irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{C} \\) because it cannot be factored into non-constant polynomials with complex coefficients. Therefore, the zero set \\( V(f) \\) is irreducible.\n\n4. **Find all singular points of \\( V(f) \\).**\n\n   A point \\( p \\in V(f) \\) is singular if the gradient \\( \\nabla f(p) = (2z_1, 2z_2, 2z_3) \\) vanishes at \\( p \\). This occurs when \\( 2z_1 = 0 \\), \\( 2z_2 = 0 \\), and \\( 2z_3 = 0 \\), i.e., \\( z_1 = 0 \\), \\( z_2 = 0 \\), \\( z_3 = 0 \\). However, the point \\( (0, 0, 0) \\) does not satisfy the equation \\( z_1^2 + z_2^2 + z_3^2 - 1 = 0 \\). Therefore, there are no singular points on \\( V(f) \\).\n\nIn summary, \\( V(f) \\) is a complex analytic variety of dimension 2, it is irreducible, and it has no singular points.",

Then:\n\n\\[\nf(x+y) = \\cos(a(x+y)) = \\cos(ax)\\cos(ay) - \\sin(ax)\\sin(ay)\n\\]\n\n\\[\nf(x-y) = \\cos(a(x-y)) = \\cos(ax)\\cos(ay) + \\sin(ax)\\sin(ay)\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\nf(x+y) + f(x-y) = 2\\cos(ax)\\cos(ay)\n\\]\n\nAnd:\n\n\\[\n2f(x)f(y) = 2\\cos(ax)\\cos(ay)\n\\]\n\nBoth sides are equal, so \\( f(x) = \\cos(ax) \\) satisfies the functional equation.\n\nCheck the condition \\( f(0) = 1 \\):\n\n\\[\nf(0) = \\cos(0) = 1\n\\]\n\nThis is satisfied for any \\( a \\).\n\n**Case 2: \\( f(x) = 0 \\) for all \\( x \\).**\n\nThis does not satisfy \\( f(0) = 1 \\), so it is not a valid solution.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe differentiable solutions satisfying the functional equation and the given conditions are of the form:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = \\cos(ax)\n\\]\n\nfor some real number \\( a \\). Thus, the set of all possible functions \\( f \\) is:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = \\cos(ax) \\quad \\text{for some } a \\in \\mathbb{R}\n\\]",

For a multi-index \\(\\beta\\), consider:\n\n\\[\n\\partial^\\beta \\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} f(x) (-2\\pi i \\langle x, \\xi \\rangle)^\\beta e^{-2\\pi i \\langle x, \\xi \\rangle} \\, dx.\n\\]\n\nUsing integration by parts, we can transfer derivatives from \\( e^{-2\\pi i \\langle x, \\xi \\rangle} \\) to \\( f(x) \\), which increases the decay rate of the integrand. Specifically, each differentiation with respect to \\(\\xi\\) introduces a factor of \\(|x|\\), and the decay condition on \\( f \\) ensures that:\n\n\\[\n|\\partial^\\beta \\hat{f}(\\xi)| \\leq C_\\beta (1 + |\\xi|)^{-m + |\\beta|}.\n\\]\n\nChoosing \\(\\beta = 0\\), we find that:\n\n\\[\n|\\hat{f}(\\xi)| \\leq C (1 + |\\xi|)^{-m}.\n\\]\n\nThus, \\(\\hat{f}(\\xi)\\) decays at least as fast as \\(|\\xi|^{-m}\\) as \\(|\\xi| \\to \\infty\\).

We seek a vector field $X$ such that:\n\n$$\n\\int_M \\text{div}_\\omega X \\, \\omega = \\int_M 1 \\, \\omega = 1\n$$\n\nBy the divergence theorem (also known as Stokes' theorem in this context), we have:\n\n$$\n\\int_M \\text{div}_\\omega X \\, \\omega = \\int_{\\partial M} \\iota_X \\omega\n$$\n\nSince $M$ has no boundary ($\\partial M = \\emptyset$), the right-hand side is zero. However, we are not directly applying the divergence theorem here; instead, we are constructing $X$ such that its divergence is 1 everywhere.\n\nConsider the Hodge star operator $*$ associated with the metric induced by $\\omega$. The Hodge star allows us to relate differential forms to vector fields. Specifically, for a 1-form $\\alpha$, the vector field $X$ corresponding to $\\alpha$ is given by:\n\n$$\nX = *^{-1}(\\alpha)\n$$\n\nWe need to find a 1-form $\\alpha$ such that:\n\n$$\nd(*\\alpha) = \\omega\n$$\n\nThis is a standard problem in Hodge theory. Since $\\omega$ is a volume form, it is closed ($d\\omega = 0$), and we can find a 1-form $\\alpha$ such that $d(*\\alpha) = \\omega$ because $M$ is compact and oriented.\n\nThe existence of such an $\\alpha$ follows from the fact that the de Rham cohomology group $H^2_{\\text{dR}}(M)$ is trivial for a compact, oriented 3-manifold without boundary.

Suppose \\( \\omega \\) can be expressed locally as \\( \\omega = f \\, dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz \\) in some coordinate chart, where \\( f \\) is a smooth, positive function.\n\nProve that there exists a smooth vector field \\( X \\) on \\( M \\) such that the divergence of \\( X \\) with respect to the volume form \\( \\omega \\) is equal to 1 everywhere on \\( M \\).\n\nAdditionally, determine the conditions under which such a vector field \\( X \\) is unique up to a divergence-free vector field.\n\n[ANSWER]\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find a vector field \\( X \\) on \\( M \\) such that the divergence of \\( X \\) with respect to the volume form \\( \\omega \\) is 1 everywhere on \\( M \\). The divergence of a vector field \\( X \\) with respect to a volume form \\( \\omega \\) is defined by the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{div}_\\omega(X) \\, \\omega = \\mathcal{L}_X \\omega\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\mathcal{L}_X \\) is the Lie derivative with respect to \\( X \\). For a volume form \\( \\omega \\), the Lie derivative can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\mathcal{L}_X \\omega = (\\text{div}_\\omega X) \\omega\n\\]\n\nGiven that \\( \\text{div}_\\omega X = 1 \\), we have:\n\n\\[\n\\mathcal{L}_X \\omega = \\omega\n\\]\n\nThis implies that \\( X \\) is a vector field whose flow expands the volume form \\( \\omega \\) by a factor of \\( e^t \\) at time \\( t \\).\n\n**Existence:**\n\nTo show the existence of such a vector field, we use the fact that \\( M \\) is compact and oriented. The condition \\( \\int_M \\omega = 1 \\) implies that \\( \\omega \\) is a probability volume form. We seek a vector field \\( X \\) such that:\n\n\\[\n\\int_M \\text{div}_\\omega X \\, \\omega = \\int_M 1 \\, \\omega = 1\n\\]\n\nBy the divergence theorem (also known as Stokes' theorem in this context), we have:\n\n\\[\n\\int_M \\text{div}_\\omega X \\, \\omega = \\int_{\\partial M} \\iota_X \\omega\n\\]\n\nSince \\( M \\) has no boundary (\\(\\partial M = \\emptyset\\)), the right-hand side is zero. However, we are not directly applying the divergence theorem here; instead, we are constructing \\( X \\) such that its divergence is 1 everywhere.\n\nConsider the Hodge star operator \\( * \\) associated with the metric induced by \\( \\omega \\). The Hodge star allows us to relate differential forms to vector fields. Specifically, for a 1-form \\( \\alpha \\), the vector field \\( X \\) corresponding to \\( \\alpha \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nX = *^{-1}(\\alpha)\n\\]\n\nWe need to find a 1-form \\( \\alpha \\) such that:\n\n\\[\nd(*\\alpha) = \\omega\n\\]\n\nThis is a standard problem in Hodge theory. Since \\( \\omega \\) is a volume form, it is closed (\\( d\\omega = 0 \\)), and we can find a 1-form \\( \\alpha \\) such that \\( d(*\\alpha) = \\omega \\) because \\( M \\) is compact and oriented.\n\nThe existence of such an \\( \\alpha \\) follows from the fact that the de Rham cohomology group \\( H^2_{\\text{dR}}(M) \\) is trivial for a compact, oriented 3-manifold without boundary. Thus, every closed 2-form is exact, and \\( \\omega \\) being closed implies it is exact.\n\nOnce \\( \\alpha \\) is found, the vector field \\( X = *^{-1}(\\alpha) \\) satisfies:\n\n\\[\n\\text{div}_\\omega X = 1\n\\]\n\n**Uniqueness:**\n\nThe vector field \\( X \\) is unique up to the addition of a divergence-free vector field. If \\( Y \\) is another vector field such that \\( \\text{div}_\\omega Y = 1 \\), then \\( X - Y \\) is a divergence-free vector field:\n\n\\[\n\\text{div}_\\omega (X - Y) = \\text{div}_\\omega X - \\text{div}_\\omega Y = 1 - 1 = 0\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( X \\) is unique up to the addition of any vector field \\( Z \\) such that \\( \\text{div}_\\omega Z = 0 \\).\n\nIn summary, the existence of \\( X \\) is guaranteed by the Hodge decomposition and the fact that \\( \\omega \\) is exact. The uniqueness up to divergence-free vector fields follows from the properties of the divergence operator.",

Each polynomial $x_i^2 - p_i$ implies that in the quotient ring $B$, each $x_i$ satisfies the relation $x_i^2 = p_i$.

The relations $x_i^2 = p_i$ imply that each $x_i$ can be represented as either $0$ or $x_i$ in $B$.

Since \\( \\text{Ker}(\\phi) \\) is a normal subgroup of \\( G \\), it must be either \\( \\{e\\} \\) or \\( G \\). If \\( \\text{Ker}(\\phi) = G \\), then \\( gH = H \\) for all \\( g \\in G \\), implying \\( H = G \\).

This is equivalent to \\( g \\in K \\) because \\( gK = K \\) if and only if \\( g \\in K \\). Thus, \\( \\text{Ker}(\\psi) = K \\).\n\n6. **Determine the order of the image of \\( G \\) under this action.**\n\n   The image of \\( G \\) under the action on \\( G/K \\) is isomorphic to the quotient group \\( G/\\text{Ker}(\\psi) = G/K \\). The order of \\( G/K \\) is \\( \\frac{n}{k} \\).\n\n7. **If \\( G \\) is a simple group, what can you conclude about \\( K \\) and \\( \\text{Ker}(\\psi) \\)?**\n\n   If \\( G \\) is simple, it has no nontrivial normal subgroups other than itself. Since \\( K \\) is a normal subgroup, it must be either \\( \\{e\\} \\) or \\( G \\). If \\( K = G \\), then \\( G/K \\) is trivial, and the action is trivial. If \\( K = \\{e\\} \\), then \\( G/K \\cong G \\), and the action is faithful, meaning \\( \\text{Ker}(\\psi) = \\{e\\} \\). Thus, \\( K = \\{e\\} \\) and \\( \\text{Ker}(\\psi) = \\{e\\} \\).",

Consider the energy functional:\n\n     \\[\n     E(t) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} \\frac{1}{2} |\\nabla u(x, t)|^2 + \\frac{1}{4}(u^2(x, t) - 1)^2 \\, dx.\n     \\]\n\n     Differentiating \\( E(t) \\) with respect to \\( t \\) and using the PDE, we find:\n\n     \\[\n     \\frac{dE}{dt} = -\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} |\\Delta u|^2 + u^2(1 - u^2)^2 \\, dx \\leq 0.\n     \\]\n\n     This shows that \\( E(t) \\) is non-increasing, implying that the \\( L^2 \\) norm of \\( u \\) and its gradient are bounded for all \\( t \\geq 0 \\). Thus, the solution can be extended globally.\n\n   - **Smoothness:** The smoothness of the solution follows from the regularity theory for parabolic equations, given the smooth initial data and the smoothness of the nonlinearity.\n\n2. **Steady States and Stability:**\n\n   The steady states \\( u_s(x) \\) satisfy:\n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta u_s + u_s(1 - u_s^2) = 0.\n   \\]\n\n   The constant solutions \\( u_s = 0, \\pm 1 \\) are obvious steady states. To analyze their stability, consider a perturbation \\( u(x, t) = u_s + \\epsilon v(x, t) \\) and linearize the PDE around \\( u_s \\):\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t} = \\Delta v + (1 - 3u_s^2)v.\n   \\]\n\n   - **Stability of \\( u_s = 0 \\):** The linearized equation becomes \\( \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t} = \\Delta v + v \\). The term \\( +v \\) indicates that \\( u_s = 0 \\) is unstable because perturbations grow exponentially.\n\n   - **Stability of \\( u_s = \\pm 1 \\):** The linearized equation becomes \\( \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t} = \\Delta v - 2v \\). The term \\( -2v \\) indicates that \\( u_s = \\pm 1 \\) are stable because perturbations decay exponentially.\n\n   Therefore, the solution \\( u(x, t) \\) approaches \\( \\pm 1 \\) as \\( t \\to \\infty \\) if the initial condition \\( g(x) \\) is such that the solution is attracted to these stable steady states. The specific attractor depends on the initial data and the domain.\n\nIn summary, the global solution exists, is unique, and smooth for all \\( t \\geq 0 \\). The solution approaches the stable steady states \\( \\pm 1 \\) as \\( t \\to \\infty \\), depending on the initial condition.",

The right-hand side \\( f \\) can be viewed as a 3-form, and its integral over \\( M \\) is 1, which is consistent with the compactness and orientation of \\( M \\).\n\nBy the Hodge decomposition theorem, any 1-form on a compact oriented manifold can be decomposed into an exact form, a coexact form, and a harmonic form. Since \\( M \\) is compact and without boundary, the space of harmonic 1-forms is isomorphic to \\( H^1_{\\text{dR}}(M) \\), which is trivial. Thus, any closed 1-form is exact, and we can find a vector field \\( X \\) such that:\n\n\\[\nd(f X^1 \\, dx + f X^2 \\, dy + f X^3 \\, dz) = f \\, dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz.\n\\]\n\nThis implies the existence of a vector field \\( X \\) satisfying the divergence condition.\n\n**Part 2: Uniqueness**\n\nTo determine the uniqueness of \\( X \\), consider two vector fields \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\) such that:\n\n\\[\n\\text{div}_\\omega(X) = \\text{div}_\\omega(Y) = 1.\n\\]\n\nThen, the vector field \\( Z = X - Y \\) satisfies:\n\n\\[\n\\text{div}_\\omega(Z) = \\text{div}_\\omega(X) - \\text{div}_\\omega(Y) = 0.\n\\]\n\nThis means \\( Z \\) is divergence-free with respect to \\( \\omega \\). The space of divergence-free vector fields on \\( M \\) is determined by the kernel of the divergence operator. By the Helmholtz decomposition, any vector field can be uniquely decomposed into a divergence-free part and a gradient of a scalar function (up to harmonic functions, which are trivial on compact manifolds without boundary).\n\nThus, \\( X \\) is unique up to the addition of a divergence-free vector field. The condition for uniqueness is that the space of divergence-free vector fields is trivial, which occurs if and only if the first Betti number \\( b_1(M) = 0 \\). This is equivalent to \\( H^1_{\\text{dR}}(M) = 0 \\).\n\nIn summary, the vector field \\( X \\) exists and is unique up to a divergence-free vector field if \\( H^1_{\\text{dR}}(M) = 0 \\).",

This implies that the multiplicative group \\( \\mathbb{F}_p^* \\) is cyclic of order \\( p-1 = 8k \\). Therefore, \\( \\mathbb{F}_p^* \\) contains an element of order 8.\n\n   Let \\( g \\) be a generator of \\( \\mathbb{F}_p^* \\). Then \\( g^{8k} = 1 \\), and \\( g^k \\) is an element of order 8. Consider the equation \\( x^4 = 2 \\) in \\( \\mathbb{F}_p \\). This can be rewritten as \\( x^4 - 2 = 0 \\).\n\n   Since \\( g^k \\) has order 8, \\( (g^k)^2 \\) has order 4. Let \\( h = (g^k)^2 \\), so \\( h^2 = g^{2k} \\) has order 4. The equation \\( x^4 = 2 \\) implies \\( x = \\sqrt[4]{2} \\), and we need to find \\( x \\) such that \\( x^4 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{p} \\).\n\n   Since \\( h^2 \\) has order 4, the equation \\( h^2 = 2 \\) has solutions if and only if 2 is a quadratic residue modulo \\( p \\).

Therefore, the boundary integral becomes:\n\\[\n\\int_{\\partial \\Omega} \\left( g(y) \\frac{\\partial G(x, y)}{\\partial n_y} - G(x, y) \\frac{\\partial g(y)}{\\partial n_y} \\right) \\, ds_y\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Simplification Using Green's Function Properties\n\nSince \\(G(x, y) = 0\\) for \\(y \\in \\partial \\Omega\\), the term \\(G(x, y) \\frac{\\partial g(y)}{\\partial n_y}\\) vanishes on the boundary:\n\\[\nG(x, y) \\frac{\\partial g(y)}{\\partial n_y} = 0\n\\]\n\nThus, the boundary integral simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\int_{\\partial \\Omega} g(y) \\frac{\\partial G(x, y)}{\\partial n_y} \\, ds_y\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTherefore, the solution \\(u(x)\\) can be expressed as:\n\\[\nu(x) = \\int_{\\partial \\Omega} g(y) \\frac{\\partial G(x, y)}{\\partial n_y} \\, ds_y\n\\]\n\nThis completes the proof. The expression is derived using the properties of the Green's function and the boundary conditions, ensuring that the solution is consistent with the given harmonic function and its boundary values.",

Each piece of \\(T\\) is a linear map with slope 3, which is greater than 1, indicating that \\(T\\) is expanding.\n\n   Consider the inverse images under \\(T\\):\n   - \\(T^{-1}([0, \\frac{1}{3})) = [0, \\frac{1}{9}) \\cup [\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{4}{9}) \\cup [\\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{7}{9})\\),\n   - \\(T^{-1}([\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{2}{3})) = [\\frac{1}{9}, \\frac{2}{9}) \\cup [\\frac{4}{9}, \\frac{5}{9}) \\cup [\\frac{7}{9}, \\frac{8}{9})\\),\n   - \\(T^{-1}([\\frac{2}{3}, 1]) = [\\frac{2}{9}, \\frac{3}{9}) \\cup [\\frac{5}{9}, \\frac{6}{9}) \\cup [\\frac{8}{9}, 1]\\).\n\n   The map \\(T\\) is topologically mixing, meaning that for any two intervals \\(I, J \\subseteq [0, 1]\\), there exists an \\(n\\) such that \\(T^n(I) \\cap J \\neq \\emptyset\\). This property implies that \\(T\\) is ergodic with respect to \\(\\mu\\).\n\n   To see why, assume \\(A\\) is \\(T\\)-invariant and has positive measure. Then, for any interval \\(I \\subseteq [0, 1]\\), the intersection \\(A \\cap I\\) is either empty or has positive measure. By the mixing property, \\(T^n(A) \\cap I\\) will eventually cover \\(I\\) for some \\(n\\), implying \\(\\mu(I) = 0\\) or \\(\\mu(I) = 1\\). Since this holds for any interval \\(I\\), \\(\\mu(A) = 1\\).\n\n   Therefore, \\(T\\) is ergodic with respect to \\(\\mu\\).\n\n2. **Lyapunov Exponent of \\(T\\) with respect to \\(\\mu\\):**\n\n   The Lyapunov exponent \\(\\lambda\\) of a map \\(T\\) with respect to a measure \\(\\mu\\) is given by\n\n   \\[\n   \\lambda = \\int \\log |T'(x)| \\, d\\mu(x).\n   \\]\n\n   For the map \\(T\\), the derivative \\(T'(x)\\) is 3 on each interval \\([0, \\frac{1}{3})\\), \\([\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{2}{3})\\), and \\([\\frac{2}{3}, 1]\\).

If \\( X_1 \\) and \\( X_2 \\) are two solutions, then \\( X_1 - X_2 \\) is divergence-free:\n\n\\[\n\\text{div}_\\omega(X_1 - X_2) = \\text{div}_\\omega(X_1) - \\text{div}_\\omega(X_2) = 1 - 1 = 0.\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( X_1 - X_2 \\) is a divergence-free vector field. The space of divergence-free vector fields is the kernel of the divergence operator, which is closed under addition and scalar multiplication.\n\nTherefore, \\( X \\) is unique up to the addition of any divergence-free vector field.\n\nIn summary, there exists a smooth vector field \\( X \\) such that \\( \\text{div}_\\omega(X) = 1 \\) everywhere on \\( M \\), and such a vector field is unique up to a divergence-free vector field.",
