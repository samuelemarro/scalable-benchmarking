            "answer": "We apply Burnside\u2019s lemma to the action of $D_{10}$ on the set of admissible colorings. The number of dihedral orbits is\n$$\n\\frac{1}{|D_{10}|}\\sum_{g\\in D_{10}} \\mathrm{Fix}(g)\n\\;=\\;\\frac{1}{20}\\sum_{g\\in D_{10}} \\mathrm{Fix}(g),\n$$\nwhere $\\mathrm{Fix}(g)$ is the number of admissible colorings fixed by the symmetry $g$.\n\n---\n\n## 1) Rotations\nLet $r$ be rotation by one bead. Consider $r^k$.\n\n### (a) Identity rotation $r^0$\nWe need the number of ways to choose $4$ bead positions on a $10$-cycle with no two adjacent. A standard formula for the number of $k$-subsets of an $n$-cycle with no adjacent elements (for $n\\ge 2k$) is\n$$\n\\frac{n}{n-k}\\binom{n-k}{k}.\n$$\nHere $n=10$, $k=4$, so\n$$\n\\mathrm{Fix}(r^0)=\\frac{10}{10-4}\\binom{10-4}{4}\n=\\frac{10}{6}\\binom{6}{4}\n=\\frac{10}{6}\\cdot 15\n=25.\n$$\n\n### (b) Rotation $r^5$ (half-turn)\nA coloring fixed by $r^5$ has period $5$, i.e., beads $(1,6)$ match, $(2,7)$ match, etc. Thus it is determined by a binary pattern of length $5$ repeated twice.\n\nHaving exactly $4$ black beads total means the length-$5$ pattern has exactly $2$ black beads.\n\nThe \u201cno adjacent black\u201d condition on the 10-cycle forces the length-$5$ pattern to have no adjacent black in the cyclic sense as well (because adjacency across the boundary between bead $5$ and $6$ corresponds to adjacency between positions $5$ and $1$ of the repeated block).\n\nSo we need the number of ways to place $2$ nonadjacent black beads on a $5$-cycle:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Fix}(r^5)=\\frac{5}{5-2}\\binom{5-2}{2}\n=\\frac{5}{3}\\binom{3}{2}\n=\\frac{5}{3}\\cdot 3\n=5.\n$$\n\n### (c) Other rotations $r^k$, $k\\neq 0,5$\nIf $\\gcd(10,k)=1$, a fixed coloring must be constant on all beads, so it has $0$ or $10$ black beads, not $4$; hence $\\mathrm{Fix}(r^k)=0$.\nIf $\\gcd(10,k)=2$, a fixed coloring has period $2$, so the number of black beads is a multiple of $5$ (either $0,5,10$), not $4$; hence $\\mathrm{Fix}(r^k)=0$.\nThus all rotations except $r^0$ and $r^5$ fix no admissible coloring.\n\nTherefore the total contribution from rotations is\n$$\n25+5=30.\n$$\n\n---\n\n## 2) Reflections\nThere are $10$ reflections in $D_{10}$, of two types (since $10$ is even):\n\n- **Type V (through opposite vertices):** $5$ reflections, each fixes $2$ opposite beads and swaps the other $8$ beads in $4$ pairs.\n- **Type E (through opposite edges):** $5$ reflections, each fixes no bead and swaps beads in $5$ pairs.\n\nWe compute $\\mathrm{Fix}$ for each type.\n\n### (a) Type E reflections (through opposite edges)\nFor such a reflection, the beads form $5$ swapped pairs. In a fixed coloring, the two beads in each pair have the same color, so the number of black beads is even, equal to $2t$ where $t$ is the number of black pairs. Since we need exactly $4$ black beads, we need exactly $t=2$ black pairs.\n\nIn a Type E reflection, two of the pairs consist of adjacent beads (one pair corresponds to beads $(1,10)$ and another to $(5,6)$ in a suitable labeling). If either of these pairs were black, it would create adjacent black beads, forbidden. Hence those two adjacent pairs must be white. So the two black pairs must be chosen from the remaining $3$ non-adjacent pairs.\n\nHowever, among those remaining three pairs, choosing the \u201cmiddle\u201d pair together with either neighbor would also create an adjacency somewhere on the necklace. One checks that the only way to pick $2$ black pairs without creating adjacent black beads is to pick the two \u201couter\u201d non-adjacent pairs, yielding exactly **one** admissible fixed coloring.\n\nThus each Type E reflection fixes exactly $1$ admissible coloring:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Fix}(\\text{Type E})=1,\n$$\nso the total Type E contribution is $5\\cdot 1=5$.\n\n### (b) Type V reflections (through opposite vertices)\nLabel beads so the reflection axis passes through beads $1$ and $6$, which are fixed points. The other beads are swapped in pairs:\n$$\n(2,10),\\ (3,9),\\ (4,8),\\ (5,7).\n$$\nLet the colors be\n- $x_1$ for bead $1$ and $x_6$ for bead $6$ (each in $\\{0,1\\}$),\n- and let $p_2,p_3,p_4,p_5\\in\\{0,1\\}$ denote the color on each swapped pair (so each $p_i=1$ contributes two black beads).\n\nThe total number of black beads is\n$$\nx_1+x_6 + 2(p_2+p_3+p_4+p_5)=4.\n$$\nLet $s=p_2+p_3+p_4+p_5$. Then $x_1+x_6+2s=4$, so the only possibilities are:\n- $s=1$ and $x_1=x_6=1$;\n- $s=2$ and $x_1=x_6=0$.\n\nNow impose the \u201cno adjacent black\u201d condition. Along beads $1,2,3,4,5,6$ this becomes:\n$$\nx_1p_2=0,\\quad p_2p_3=0,\\quad p_3p_4=0,\\quad p_4p_5=0,\\quad p_5x_6=0,\n$$\nand the remaining adjacencies are symmetric repeats.\n\n**Case 1: $s=1$, $x_1=x_6=1$.**  \nThen $x_1=1$ forces $p_2=0$, and $x_6=1$ forces $p_5=0$.

            "raw_answer": "[QUESTION]\nA necklace has $10$ equally spaced beads arranged on a circle. Each bead is colored either black or white. A coloring is **admissible** if it has exactly $4$ black beads and no two black beads are adjacent (where bead $10$ is adjacent to bead $1$).\n\nTwo admissible colorings are considered the same if one can be obtained from the other by a symmetry of the regular decagon (i.e., by a rotation or a reflection; the dihedral group $D_{10}$ of order $20$).\n\nDetermine the number of distinct admissible colorings up to dihedral symmetry.\n\n[ANSWER]\nWe apply Burnside\u2019s lemma to the action of $D_{10}$ on the set of admissible colorings. The number of dihedral orbits is\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{|D_{10}|}\\sum_{g\\in D_{10}} \\mathrm{Fix}(g)\n\\;=\\;\\frac{1}{20}\\sum_{g\\in D_{10}} \\mathrm{Fix}(g),\n\\]\nwhere $\\mathrm{Fix}(g)$ is the number of admissible colorings fixed by the symmetry $g$.\n\n---\n\n## 1) Rotations\nLet $r$ be rotation by one bead. Consider $r^k$.\n\n### (a) Identity rotation $r^0$\nWe need the number of ways to choose $4$ bead positions on a $10$-cycle with no two adjacent. A standard formula for the number of $k$-subsets of an $n$-cycle with no adjacent elements (for $n\\ge 2k$) is\n\\[\n\\frac{n}{n-k}\\binom{n-k}{k}.\n\\]\nHere $n=10$, $k=4$, so\n\\[\n\\mathrm{Fix}(r^0)=\\frac{10}{10-4}\\binom{10-4}{4}\n=\\frac{10}{6}\\binom{6}{4}\n=\\frac{10}{6}\\cdot 15\n=25.\n\\]\n\n### (b) Rotation $r^5$ (half-turn)\nA coloring fixed by $r^5$ has period $5$, i.e., beads $(1,6)$ match, $(2,7)$ match, etc. Thus it is determined by a binary pattern of length $5$ repeated twice.\n\nHaving exactly $4$ black beads total means the length-$5$ pattern has exactly $2$ black beads.\n\nThe \u201cno adjacent black\u201d condition on the 10-cycle forces the length-$5$ pattern to have no adjacent black in the cyclic sense as well (because adjacency across the boundary between bead $5$ and $6$ corresponds to adjacency between positions $5$ and $1$ of the repeated block).\n\nSo we need the number of ways to place $2$ nonadjacent black beads on a $5$-cycle:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{Fix}(r^5)=\\frac{5}{5-2}\\binom{5-2}{2}\n=\\frac{5}{3}\\binom{3}{2}\n=\\frac{5}{3}\\cdot 3\n=5.\n\\]\n\n### (c) Other rotations $r^k$, $k\\neq 0,5$\nIf $\\gcd(10,k)=1$, a fixed coloring must be constant on all beads, so it has $0$ or $10$ black beads, not $4$; hence $\\mathrm{Fix}(r^k)=0$.\nIf $\\gcd(10,k)=2$, a fixed coloring has period $2$, so the number of black beads is a multiple of $5$ (either $0,5,10$), not $4$; hence $\\mathrm{Fix}(r^k)=0$.\nThus all rotations except $r^0$ and $r^5$ fix no admissible coloring.\n\nTherefore the total contribution from rotations is\n\\[\n25+5=30.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n## 2) Reflections\nThere are $10$ reflections in $D_{10}$, of two types (since $10$ is even):\n\n- **Type V (through opposite vertices):** $5$ reflections, each fixes $2$ opposite beads and swaps the other $8$ beads in $4$ pairs.\n- **Type E (through opposite edges):** $5$ reflections, each fixes no bead and swaps beads in $5$ pairs.\n\nWe compute $\\mathrm{Fix}$ for each type.\n\n### (a) Type E reflections (through opposite edges)\nFor such a reflection, the beads form $5$ swapped pairs. In a fixed coloring, the two beads in each pair have the same color, so the number of black beads is even, equal to $2t$ where $t$ is the number of black pairs. Since we need exactly $4$ black beads, we need exactly $t=2$ black pairs.\n\nIn a Type E reflection, two of the pairs consist of adjacent beads (one pair corresponds to beads $(1,10)$ and another to $(5,6)$ in a suitable labeling). If either of these pairs were black, it would create adjacent black beads, forbidden. Hence those two adjacent pairs must be white. So the two black pairs must be chosen from the remaining $3$ non-adjacent pairs.\n\nHowever, among those remaining three pairs, choosing the \u201cmiddle\u201d pair together with either neighbor would also create an adjacency somewhere on the necklace. One checks that the only way to pick $2$ black pairs without creating adjacent black beads is to pick the two \u201couter\u201d non-adjacent pairs, yielding exactly **one** admissible fixed coloring.\n\nThus each Type E reflection fixes exactly $1$ admissible coloring:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{Fix}(\\text{Type E})=1,\n\\]\nso the total Type E contribution is $5\\cdot 1=5$.\n\n### (b) Type V reflections (through opposite vertices)\nLabel beads so the reflection axis passes through beads $1$ and $6$, which are fixed points. The other beads are swapped in pairs:\n\\[\n(2,10),\\ (3,9),\\ (4,8),\\ (5,7).\n\\]\nLet the colors be\n- $x_1$ for bead $1$ and $x_6$ for bead $6$ (each in $\\{0,1\\}$),\n- and let $p_2,p_3,p_4,p_5\\in\\{0,1\\}$ denote the color on each swapped pair (so each $p_i=1$ contributes two black beads).\n\nThe total number of black beads is\n\\[\nx_1+x_6 + 2(p_2+p_3+p_4+p_5)=4.\n\\]\nLet $s=p_2+p_3+p_4+p_5$. Then $x_1+x_6+2s=4$, so the only possibilities are:\n- $s=1$ and $x_1=x_6=1$;\n- $s=2$ and $x_1=x_6=0$.\n\nNow impose the \u201cno adjacent black\u201d condition. Along beads $1,2,3,4,5,6$ this becomes:\n\\[\nx_1p_2=0,\\quad p_2p_3=0,\\quad p_3p_4=0,\\quad p_4p_5=0,\\quad p_5x_6=0,\n\\]\nand the remaining adjacencies are symmetric repeats.\n\n**Case 1: $s=1$, $x_1=x_6=1$.**  \nThen $x_1=1$ forces $p_2=0$, and $x_6=1$ forces $p_5=0$. With exactly one of $p_2,p_3,p_4,p_5$ equal to $1$, it must be either $p_3=1$ or $p_4=1$. Both work. So there are $2$ fixed colorings here.\n\n**Case 2: $s=2$, $x_1=x_6=0$.**  \nNow we need exactly two of $p_2,p_3,p_4,p_5$ to be $1$ with no adjacent ones along the path $p_2-p_3-p_4-p_5$. The valid 2-subsets are\n\\[\n\\{p_2,p_4\\},\\ \\{p_2,p_5\\},\\ \\{p_3,p_5\\},\n\\]\nso there are $3$ fixed colorings here.\n\nHence each Type V reflection fixes $2+3=5$ admissible colorings:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{Fix}(\\text{Type V})=5,\n\\]\nso the total Type V contribution is $5\\cdot 5=25$.\n\nTherefore the total contribution from reflections is\n\\[\n25+5=30.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n## 3) Burnside average\nSumming all fixed counts:\n\\[\n\\sum_{g\\in D_{10}}\\mathrm{Fix}(g)=\\underbrace{30}_{\\text{rotations}}+\\underbrace{30}_{\\text{reflections}}=60.\n\\]\nThus the number of distinct admissible colorings up to dihedral symmetry is\n\\[\n\\frac{60}{20}=3.\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]",

In $J(Q)$, meet and join are given by\n\\[\nI\\wedge J = I\\cap J,\\qquad I\\vee J = I\\cup J\n\\]\n(because the union of two ideals is again an ideal). In $\\operatorname{DM}(P)$, meet is intersection and join is $ul$-closure of union; but for these seven closed sets one checks that the $ul$-closure of a union is exactly the least closed set containing it, matching the union behavior under $\\Phi$ along the inclusion lattice. Equivalently, since $\\Phi$ is an order isomorphism between finite lattices, it automatically preserves $\\wedge,\\vee$.\n\nThus $\\Phi$ is a lattice isomorphism:\n\\[\n\\operatorname{DM}(P)\\ \\cong\\ J(Q).\n\\]\n\nFinally, **$J(Q)$ is distributive** (indeed, the lattice of order ideals of any poset is distributive, with $\\cap$ and $\\cup$ as meet/join). Therefore $\\operatorname{DM}(P)$ is distributive as well.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\ \\operatorname{DM}(P)\\text{ has 7 elements, is obtained from }P\\text{ by adding one new element, and is distributive.}\\ }\n\\]",

The Galois group.**  \nSince $L$ is a splitting field over a characteristic-$0$ field, $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is Galois, so $|G|=[L:\\mathbb{Q}]=8$.\n\nDefine automorphisms $r,s\\in G$ by their actions on generators:\n\\[\nr(\\alpha)=i\\alpha,\\quad r(i)=i;\\qquad s(\\alpha)=\\alpha,\\quad s(i)=-i.\n\\]\nThese are well-defined $\\mathbb{Q}$-automorphisms because they preserve the defining relations $\\alpha^4=2$ and $i^2=-1$.\n\nCompute relations:\n- $r^4(\\alpha)=i^4\\alpha=\\alpha$ and $r^4(i)=i$, so $r^4=1$.\n- $s^2=1$.\n- Conjugation: $srs(\\alpha)=sr(\\alpha)=s(i\\alpha)=-i\\alpha=r^{-1}(\\alpha)$ and $srs(i)=i=r^{-1}(i)$, hence\n\\[\nsrs=r^{-1}.\n\\]\nThus $\\langle r,s\\rangle$ is a quotient of the dihedral group $D_4=\\langle r,s\\mid r^4=s^2=1,\\ srs=r^{-1}\\rangle$.

All intermediate fields.**  \nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, intermediate fields correspond bijectively to subgroups of $G\\cong D_4$. The group $D_4$ has exactly:\n- $1$ subgroup of order $8$ (all of $G$),\n- $3$ subgroups of order $4$,\n- $5$ subgroups of order $2$,\n- $1$ subgroup of order $1$.\n\nHence there are $10$ intermediate fields total: $\\mathbb{Q}$, $L$, three quadratic fields, and five quartic fields.\n\nWe use the concrete $r,s$ above and compute fixed fields.\n\n---\n\n### Quadratic subfields (index $4$, i.e. fixed by order-$4$ subgroups)\n\n1. **$L^{\\langle r\\rangle}=\\mathbb{Q}(i)$.**  \n$r$ fixes $i$ and moves $\\alpha$, so $\\mathbb{Q}(i)\\subseteq L^{\\langle r\\rangle}$. Since $[L:L^{\\langle r\\rangle}]=|\\langle r\\rangle|=4$, we have $[L^{\\langle r\\rangle}:\\mathbb{Q}]=2$, hence $L^{\\langle r\\rangle}$ is a quadratic field containing $i$, so it must be $\\mathbb{Q}(i)$.\n\n2. **$L^{\\langle r^2,s\\rangle}=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.**  \nNote $s$ is complex conjugation on $L=\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)\\oplus i\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$, so $L^{\\langle s\\rangle}=\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$.  \nInside $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$, $r^2$ sends $\\alpha\\mapsto -\\alpha$, so it fixes exactly the even part $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha^2)=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt2)$. Hence the common fixed field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt2)$.\n\n3. **$L^{\\langle r^2,rs\\rangle}=\\mathbb{Q}(i\\sqrt{2})$.**  \nCheck that $r^2$ fixes $\\alpha^2=\\sqrt2$ and fixes $i$, while $rs$ sends $i\\mapsto -i$ and $\\alpha^2\\mapsto (i\\alpha)^2=-\\alpha^2$, so\n\\[\n(rs)(i\\alpha^2)=(-i)(-\\alpha^2)=i\\alpha^2,\n\\]\nand also $r^2(i\\alpha^2)=i\\alpha^2$. Thus $i\\sqrt2=i\\alpha^2$ is fixed by $\\langle r^2,rs\\rangle$, so $\\mathbb{Q}(i\\sqrt2)\\subseteq L^{\\langle r^2,rs\\rangle}$.  \nSince this subgroup has order $4$, its fixed field is quadratic, hence must equal $\\mathbb{Q}(i\\sqrt2)$.\n\nSo the **three quadratic intermediate fields** are\n\\[\n\\mathbb{Q}(i),\\quad \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt2),\\quad \\mathbb{Q}(i\\sqrt2).\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Quartic subfields (index $2$, i.e. fixed by order-$2$ subgroups)\n\nThere are five order-$2$ subgroups: $\\langle s\\rangle,\\langle r^2\\rangle,\\langle r^2s\\rangle,\\langle rs\\rangle,\\langle r^3s\\rangle$. Their fixed fields (each of degree $4$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$) are:\n\n1. **$L^{\\langle s\\rangle}=\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$.**  \nAs noted above, $s$ is complex conjugation, so the fixed field is the real subfield $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$.\n\n2. **$L^{\\langle r^2\\rangle}=\\mathbb{Q}(i,\\alpha^2)=\\mathbb{Q}(i,\\sqrt2)$.**  \n$r^2$ sends $\\alpha\\mapsto -\\alpha$ and fixes $i$. Thus it fixes $i$ and $\\alpha^2=\\sqrt2$, so $\\mathbb{Q}(i,\\sqrt2)\\subseteq L^{\\langle r^2\\rangle}$.  \nBut $[L:L^{\\langle r^2\\rangle}]=2$, so $[L^{\\langle r^2\\rangle}:\\mathbb{Q}]=4$. Also $[\\mathbb{Q}(i,\\sqrt2):\\mathbb{Q}]=4$, hence equality holds.\n\n3. **$L^{\\langle r^2s\\rangle}=\\mathbb{Q}(i\\alpha)$.**  \nHere $(r^2s)(\\alpha)=-\\alpha$ and $(r^2s)(i)=-i$, so $(r^2s)(i\\alpha)=(-i)(-\\alpha)=i\\alpha$. Hence $\\mathbb{Q}(i\\alpha)\\subseteq L^{\\langle r^2s\\rangle}$.  \nMoreover $(i\\alpha)^4=i^4\\alpha^4=2$, so $i\\alpha$ is a root of $x^4-2$, which is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$; thus $[\\mathbb{Q}(i\\alpha):\\mathbb{Q}]=4$. Therefore $L^{\\langle r^2s\\rangle}=\\mathbb{Q}(i\\alpha)$.\n\n4. **$L^{\\langle rs\\rangle}=\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha(1+i))$.**  \nLet $\\theta=\\alpha(1+i)$.

So we need the **conductor** of the numerical semigroup $S$.\n\nWe claim the smallest integer $c$ such that every integer $\\ge c$ lies in $S$ is\n\\[\nc=12.\n\\]\n- First, $11\\notin S$: check $11$ cannot be written as $4a+6b+9c$. If $c\\ge 1$ then $9c\\le 11$ forces $c=1$, and $11-9=2$ is not in $4\\mathbb Z_{\\ge 0}+6\\mathbb Z_{\\ge 0}$. If $c=0$, then $4a+6b=11$ has no solutions.\n- Next, $12,13,14,15\\in S$:\n\\[\n12=3\\cdot 4,\\quad 13=4+9,\\quad 14=2\\cdot 4+6,\\quad 15=6+9.\n\\]\n- Finally, if $n\\ge 12$, write $n=12+r+4q$ with $r\\in\\{0,1,2,3\\}$ and $q\\ge 0$. Since each $12+r\\in\\{12,13,14,15\\}\\subseteq S$ and $4q\\in S$, we get $n\\in S$.\n\nThus the conductor exponent is $c=12$. It follows that as an ideal of $k[t]$,\n\\[\n\\mathfrak f = t^{12}k[t].\n\\]\nAs an ideal of $A$, it is generated by the monomials in $A$ of degrees $\\ge 12$, and using the above \u201cmod $4$\u201d decomposition,\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\mathfrak f=(t^{12},t^{13},t^{14},t^{15})A.}\n\\]\nMinimality: none of $t^{12},t^{13},t^{14},t^{15}$ lies in the $A$-ideal generated by the other three, because that would require writing (for instance) $13=12+s$ or $13=14+s$ or $13=15+s$ with $s\\in S$, i.e. $s\\in\\{1,-1,-2\\}$, impossible; similarly for $14$ and $15$ (differences $2,1,3$ are not in $S$).

Then $A/J\\cong k$ via the map sending $x,y\\mapsto 0$ and $1\\mapsto 1$, hence $J$ is maximal. Also $A$ is finite-dimensional over $k$, so it is Artinian; since $J$ is the unique maximal ideal (see below), it equals the Jacobson radical.\n\nTo see uniqueness of the maximal ideal: any maximal ideal $\\mathfrak m$ yields a simple $A$-module $A/\\mathfrak m$, hence a division $k$-algebra quotient. But $x,y$ are nilpotent, so their images in any division algebra must be $0$, forcing $x,y\\in \\mathfrak m$. Hence $(x,y)\\subseteq \\mathfrak m$, so $\\mathfrak m=(x,y)=J$. Therefore $J(A)=J$ and $A$ is local.\n\nAs a $k$-space,\n$$\nJ=(x,y)=kx\\oplus ky\\oplus kw\n$$\nsince $w=xy\\in (x,y)$.\n\n### Powers\nCompute\n$$\nJ^2=(x,y)^2=(x^2,xy,yx,y^2)=(0,w,-w,0)=kw,\n$$\nso $J^2=kw$ is $1$-dimensional. Then\n$$\nJ^3 = J\\cdot J^2 = (x,y)\\cdot (kw) = k(xw)+k(yw)=0,\n$$\nso $J^3=0$.\n\n### Classification of two-sided ideals\nLet $I$ be a two-sided ideal.\n\n- If $1\\in I$, then $I=A$.\n- Otherwise $I\\subseteq J$, because $A/J\\cong k$ is a field, so the only ideals containing $J$ are $J$ and $A$.\n\nSo it remains to classify ideals $I\\subseteq J$.\n\n**Claim 1.** Every nonzero ideal $I\\subseteq J$ contains $w$.\n\nProof: take $0\\neq r\\in I$.

Since $J/J^2$ is $2$-dimensional with basis $\\{\\bar x,\\bar y\\}$, its subspaces are: $0$, all $1$-dimensional lines, and the whole space.

Then $A/J\\cong k$ via the map sending $x,y\\mapsto 0$ and $1\\mapsto 1$, hence $J$ is maximal. Also $A$ is finite-dimensional over $k$, so it is Artinian; since $J$ is the unique maximal ideal (see below), it equals the Jacobson radical.\n\nTo see uniqueness of the maximal ideal: any maximal ideal $\\mathfrak m$ yields a simple $A$-module $A/\\mathfrak m$, hence a division $k$-algebra quotient. But $x,y$ are nilpotent, so their images in any division algebra must be $0$, forcing $x,y\\in \\mathfrak m$. Hence $(x,y)\\subseteq \\mathfrak m$, so $\\mathfrak m=(x,y)=J$. Therefore $J(A)=J$ and $A$ is local.\n\nAs a $k$-space,\n\\[\nJ=(x,y)=kx\\oplus ky\\oplus kw\n\\]\nsince $w=xy\\in (x,y)$.\n\n### Powers\nCompute\n\\[\nJ^2=(x,y)^2=(x^2,xy,yx,y^2)=(0,w,-w,0)=kw,\n\\]\nso $J^2=kw$ is $1$-dimensional. Then\n\\[\nJ^3 = J\\cdot J^2 = (x,y)\\cdot (kw) = k(xw)+k(yw)=0,\n\\]\nso $J^3=0$.\n\n### Classification of two-sided ideals\nLet $I$ be a two-sided ideal.\n\n- If $1\\in I$, then $I=A$.\n- Otherwise $I\\subseteq J$, because $A/J\\cong k$ is a field, so the only ideals containing $J$ are $J$ and $A$.\n\nSo it remains to classify ideals $I\\subseteq J$.\n\n**Claim 1.** Every nonzero ideal $I\\subseteq J$ contains $w$.\n\nProof: take $0\\neq r\\in I$. Write $r=ax+by+cw$.\n- If $b\\neq 0$, then $x r = x(ax+by+cw)=b\\,xy=bw\\in I$, so $w\\in I$.\n- If $b=0$ and $a\\neq 0$, then $y r = y(ax+cw)=a\\,yx = -a w\\in I$, so again $w\\in I$.\n- If $a=b=0$, then $r=cw$ already gives $w\\in I$.\n\nSo any nonzero $I\\subseteq J$ satisfies $kw=J^2\\subseteq I$.\n\nThus ideals inside $J$ correspond to $k$-subspaces between $J^2$ and $J$. Since $J/J^2$ is $2$-dimensional with basis $\\{\\bar x,\\bar y\\}$, its subspaces are: $0$, all $1$-dimensional lines, and the whole space.

Thus the integrand $\\zeta\\mapsto f(\\zeta,w)\\zeta^{-n-1}$ is holomorphic on $A$, and Cauchy\u2019s theorem on $A$ gives\n\\[\n\\int_{|\\zeta|=\\rho_2} f(\\zeta,w)\\zeta^{-n-1}\\,d\\zeta-\\int_{|\\zeta|=\\rho_1} f(\\zeta,w)\\zeta^{-n-1}\\,d\\zeta=0.\n\\]\nSo $I(\\rho_1)=I(\\rho_2)$. \u220e\n\nHence we may define, for any $\\rho\\in(r,1)$,\n\\[\na_n(w):=\\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\\int_{|\\zeta|=\\rho} f(\\zeta,w)\\,\\zeta^{-n-1}\\,d\\zeta,\n\\]\nand by the lemma this does not depend on the chosen $\\rho\\in(r,1)$.\n\n### (a) $a_n\\in\\mathcal O(\\Delta)$\nFor fixed $\\zeta$ with $|\\zeta|=\\rho>r$, the map $w\\mapsto f(\\zeta,w)$ is holomorphic on $\\Delta$ since $(\\zeta,w)\\in D$ for all $|w|<1$. Differentiation under the integral sign (or Morera) gives $a_n\\in\\mathcal O(\\Delta)$.\n\n### (b) Laurent expansion in $z$ when $s\\le |w|<1$\nFix $w$ with $s\\le |w|<1$. Then for all $z$ with $r<|z|<1$ we have $(z,w)\\in D$, so $z\\mapsto f(z,w)$ is holomorphic on the annulus $r<|z|<1$. By the one-variable Laurent theorem,\n\\[\nf(z,w)=\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} a_n(w)\\,z^n\\qquad (r<|z|<1),\n\\]\nwhere the coefficients are given by the Cauchy integrals above; the lemma ensures the same $a_n(w)$ work for any radius $\\rho\\in(r,1)$.\n\n### (c) The negative coefficients vanish identically\nIf $|w|<s$, then $(z,w)\\in D$ for every $|z|<1$, hence $z\\mapsto f(z,w)$ is holomorphic on the full unit disc. Fix any $\\rho\\in(r,1)$. For $n<0$ write $n=-m$ with $m\\ge1$. Then\n\\[\na_{-m}(w)=\\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\\int_{|\\zeta|=\\rho} f(\\zeta,w)\\,\\zeta^{m-1}\\,d\\zeta=0,\n\\]\nbecause $\\zeta\\mapsto f(\\zeta,w)\\zeta^{m-1}$ is holomorphic on $|\\zeta|<1$ and Cauchy\u2019s theorem applies. Thus $a_n(w)=0$ for all $n<0$ and all $|w|<s$. Since each $a_n$ is holomorphic on $\\Delta$, the identity theorem implies\n\\[\na_n(w)\\equiv 0\\quad\\text{on }\\Delta\\qquad(n<0).\n\\]\n\nTherefore for $s\\le |w|<1$ and $r<|z|<1$,\n\\[\nf(z,w)=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n(w)\\,z^n.\n\\]\n\n### (d) Define the extension and prove it is holomorphic on $\\Delta^2$\nDefine on all of $\\Delta^2$:\n\\[\nF(z,w):=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n(w)\\,z^n.\n\\]\nTo prove $F\\in\\mathcal O(\\Delta^2)$, fix a compact polydisc\n\\[\nK=\\{(z,w):|z|\\le t,\\ |w|\\le u\\}\\subset\\Delta^2\\qquad(0<t,u<1).\n\\]\nChoose $\\rho\\in(r,1)$ with $t<\\rho<1$. By the radius-independence lemma we are free to use this $\\rho$ in the coefficient formula. Set\n\\[\nM:=\\sup\\{|f(\\zeta,w)|:\\ |\\zeta|=\\rho,\\ |w|\\le u\\}<\\infty,\n\\]\nfinite because $\\{|\\zeta|=\\rho\\}\\times\\{|w|\\le u\\}$ is compact in $D$. Then for $n\\ge0$ and $|w|\\le u$,\n\\[\n|a_n(w)|\n\\le \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{|\\zeta|=\\rho}|f(\\zeta,w)|\\,|\\zeta|^{-n-1}\\,|d\\zeta|\n\\le M\\rho^{-n}.\n\\]\nHence for $(z,w)\\in K$,\n\\[\n|a_n(w)z^n|\\le M\\left(\\frac{t}{\\rho}\\right)^n,\n\\]\nand $\\sum_{n\\ge0}M(t/\\rho)^n$ converges. By the Weierstrass $M$-test the series defining $F$ converges uniformly on $K$, so $F$ is holomorphic on $\\Delta^2$.\n\n### (e) $F$ agrees with $f$ on $D$\n- If $|w|<s$, then $f(\\,\\cdot\\,,w)$ is holomorphic on $|z|<1$ and has Taylor series $\\sum_{n\\ge0}a_n(w)z^n$, so $F(z,w)=f(z,w)$ for all $|z|<1$.\n- If $s\\le |w|<1$, then by (b)\u2013(c) we already have $f(z,w)=\\sum_{n\\ge0}a_n(w)z^n=F(z,w)$ on $r<|z|<1$.\n\nThese two regions cover $D$, hence $F|_D=f$.\n\n### (f) Uniqueness\nIf $F_1,F_2\\in\\mathcal O(\\Delta^2)$ both extend $f$, then $F_1-F_2$ vanishes on the open set $\\{|w|<s,\\ |z|<1\\}\\subset D$, so by the identity theorem on the connected domain $\\Delta^2$ we get $F_1\\equiv F_2$.\n\nThis proves (1).\n\n---\n\n## 2) The envelope of holomorphy of $D$ is exactly $\\Delta^2$\n\nUse the standard **schlicht** (univalent) definition: the envelope of holomorphy $E(D)\\subset\\mathbb C^2$ is the unique maximal domain containing $D$ with the property that every $f\\in\\mathcal O(D)$ extends to some $\\tilde f\\in\\mathcal O(E(D))$ (maximal by inclusion among such domains).\n\n### (i) $\\Delta^2\\subset E(D)$\nBy Part 1, every $f\\in\\mathcal O(D)$ extends holomorphically to $\\Delta^2$. Thus $\\Delta^2$ is one of the domains to which all holomorphic functions on $D$ extend, so maximality forces $\\Delta^2\\subset E(D)$.\n\n### (ii) $E(D)\\subset \\Delta^2$\nLet\n\\[\ng(z)=\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty z^{2^k},\\qquad h(w)=\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty w^{2^k}.\n\\]\nBy the Hadamard gap theorem, both have $|\\zeta|=1$ as a natural boundary (no analytic continuation across any point of the unit circle). Define $f_1(z,w)=g(z)$ and $f_2(z,w)=h(w)$. Since $|z|<1$ and $|w|<1$ on $D$, we have $f_1,f_2\\in\\mathcal O(D)$.\n\nAssume for contradiction that $E(D)$ contains a point $p\\notin\\Delta^2$. Since $E(D)$ is a domain, choose a continuous path $\\gamma:[0,1]\\to E(D)$ with $\\gamma(0)=(0,0)$ and $\\gamma(1)=p$. Let\n\\[\nt_0:=\\sup\\{t\\in[0,1]:\\gamma([0,t])\\subset\\Delta^2\\},\\qquad q:=\\gamma(t_0)\\in\\partial\\Delta^2.\n\\]\nBecause $E(D)$ is open, there exists $\\varepsilon>0$ such that the polydisc\n\\[\nP:=\\Delta(q_z,\\varepsilon)\\times\\Delta(q_w,\\varepsilon)\\subset E(D).\n\\]\nSince $q\\in\\partial\\Delta^2$, either $|q_z|=1$ with $|q_w|\\le 1$, or $|q_w|=1$ with $|q_z|\\le 1$.\n\n- If $|q_z|=1$, pick $w_0\\in \\Delta(q_w,\\varepsilon)\\cap\\Delta$ (nonempty). Let $\\widetilde f_1\\in\\mathcal O(E(D))$ be the extension of $f_1$. Then $z\\mapsto \\widetilde f_1(z,w_0)$ is holomorphic on $\\Delta(q_z,\\varepsilon)$, and on $\\Delta(q_z,\\varepsilon)\\cap\\Delta$ we have $\\widetilde f_1(z,w_0)=g(z)$ (they agree on $\\Delta^2$ by uniqueness of the Part 1 extension and the identity theorem). Thus $g$ analytically continues across the point $q_z$ on $|z|=1$, contradicting that $|z|=1$ is a natural boundary for $g$.\n\n- If $|q_w|=1$, similarly choose $z_0\\in \\Delta(q_z,\\varepsilon)\\cap\\Delta$ and use the extension $\\widetilde f_2$ of $f_2$ to get an analytic continuation of $h$ across $q_w$, again a contradiction.\n\nHence no such $p$ exists, so $E(D)\\subset\\Delta^2$.\n\nCombining (i) and (ii) yields\n\\[\nE(D)=\\Delta^2.\n\\]\n\nThis proves (2).",

Let\n\\[\n\\mathcal B_\\infty:=\\{B\\in\\mathcal B:\\infty\\in B\\},\n\\]\nwhich is countable. For each $B\\in\\mathcal B_\\infty$, since $B$ is a neighborhood of $\\infty$, it has the form\n\\[\nB=\\alpha X\\setminus K_B\n\\]\nfor some compact $K_B\\subseteq X$. Enumerate $\\mathcal B_\\infty=\\{B_n\\}_{n\\ge1}$ and write $B_n=\\alpha X\\setminus K_n$.\n\nIf $K\\subseteq X$ is compact, then $\\alpha X\\setminus K$ is a neighborhood of $\\infty$, so by the base property there is some $n$ with\n\\[\n\\infty\\in B_n\\subseteq \\alpha X\\setminus K.\n\\]\nTaking complements in $\\alpha X$ gives $K\\subseteq K_n$.\n\nNow for any $x\\in X$, the singleton $\\{x\\}$ is compact, hence $\\{x\\}\\subseteq K_n$ for some $n$, i.e. $x\\in K_n$. Therefore\n\\[\nX=\\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty K_n,\n\\]\nso $X$ is $\\sigma$-compact.\n\n---\n\n### (\u21d0) If $X$ is metrizable and $\\sigma$-compact, then $\\alpha X$ is metrizable\nAssume $X$ is metrizable and $\\sigma$-compact (and still locally compact Hausdorff, non-compact).\n\n#### Step 1: Relatively compact neighborhoods of compact sets\n**Lemma.** If $F\\subseteq X$ is compact, then there exists an open set $V\\subseteq X$ with $F\\subseteq V$ and $\\overline V$ compact.\n\n*Proof.* For each $x\\in F$, local compactness gives an open $U_x\\ni x$ with $\\overline{U_x}$ compact. The sets $U_x$ cover $F$, so choose finitely many $x_1,\\dots,x_m$ with $F\\subseteq U_{x_1}\\cup\\cdots\\cup U_{x_m}=:V$. Then\n\\[\n\\overline V\\subseteq \\overline{U_{x_1}}\\cup\\cdots\\cup \\overline{U_{x_m}},\n\\]\na finite union of compact sets, hence compact. \u220e\n\n#### Step 2: An increasing compact exhaustion cofinal among compact sets\nWrite $X=\\bigcup_{n\\ge1} C_n$ with each $C_n$ compact. Construct open sets $W_n\\subseteq X$ such that:\n\n1. $C_1\\cup\\cdots\\cup C_n\\subseteq W_n$,\n2. $\\overline{W_n}$ is compact,\n3. $\\overline{W_n}\\subseteq W_{n+1}$.\n\nStart with $W_1$ from the lemma applied to $F=C_1$. Given $W_n$, apply the lemma to the compact set $F:=\\overline{W_n}\\cup C_{n+1}$ to get open $W_{n+1}\\supseteq F$ with $\\overline{W_{n+1}}$ compact; then $\\overline{W_n}\\subseteq W_{n+1}$.\n\nSet $K_n:=\\overline{W_n}$. Then each $K_n$ is compact, $K_n\\subseteq K_{n+1}$, and also\n\\[\nK_n=\\overline{W_n}\\subseteq W_{n+1}\\subseteq \\operatorname{int}(K_{n+1}).\n\\]\nMoreover, $X=\\bigcup_{n\\ge1}\\operatorname{int}(K_n)$.\n\n**Cofinality:** If $K\\subseteq X$ is compact, then $\\{\\operatorname{int}(K_n)\\}_{n\\ge1}$ is an open cover of $K$, so $K\\subseteq \\operatorname{int}(K_{n_1})\\cup\\cdots\\cup \\operatorname{int}(K_{n_r})$. Let $N=\\max\\{n_1,\\dots,n_r\\}$. Since $K_n\\subseteq \\operatorname{int}(K_{n+1})$ implies $\\operatorname{int}(K_n)\\subseteq \\operatorname{int}(K_{n+1})$, we get\n\\[\nK\\subseteq \\operatorname{int}(K_N)\\subseteq K_N.\n\\]\n\n#### Step 3: A countable neighborhood base at $\\infty$\nDefine\n\\[\nU_n:=\\alpha X\\setminus K_n.\n\\]\nThen each $U_n$ is an open neighborhood of $\\infty$. If $U=\\alpha X\\setminus K$ is any neighborhood of $\\infty$ (with $K\\subseteq X$ compact), choose $N$ with $K\\subseteq K_N$; then $U_N\\subseteq U$. Hence $\\{U_n\\}$ is a countable local base at $\\infty$.\n\n#### Step 4: $\\alpha X$ is second countable\nBecause $X$ is metrizable and $\\sigma$-compact, it is separable: each compact metric $C_n$ is separable, and a countable union of separable subsets is separable. A separable metric space is second countable, so $X$ has a countable base $\\mathcal B_X$.\n\nThen\n\\[\n\\mathcal B:=\\mathcal B_X\\ \\cup\\ \\{U_n:n\\ge1\\}\n\\]\nis a countable base for $\\alpha X$: points of $X$ are handled by $\\mathcal B_X$, and neighborhoods of $\\infty$ are handled by $\\{U_n\\}$.\n\n#### Step 5: Metrizability\nFrom (1), $\\alpha X$ is compact Hausdorff, hence regular. A regular second countable space is metrizable (Urysohn metrization theorem). Therefore $\\alpha X$ is metrizable.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\nFor locally compact, non-compact Hausdorff $X$, $\\alpha X$ is compact Hausdorff, and\n\\[\n\\alpha X \\text{ is metrizable } \\Longleftrightarrow X \\text{ is metrizable and } \\sigma\\text{-compact}.\n\\]",
