## Self-Critique Guidance (Self-Improvement Role)

This rubric guides the self-evaluation process during answer refinement. Your goal is to identify whether your answer is ready for submission or needs improvement.

### Primary Goal

Determine whether your answer satisfies the quality standards well enough to be considered complete and correct. You are evaluating your own work to decide: **"Is this answer good enough, or should I refine it?"**

### Self-Evaluation Process

**1. Check for Correctness**
- Review your mathematical steps for logical validity
- Verify calculations and algebraic manipulations
- Check that theorem applications are valid (hypotheses satisfied, conclusions properly drawn)
- Ensure your final answer directly addresses what the question asks

**2. Check for Completeness**
- Did you address all parts of the question?
- Did you handle relevant edge cases or boundary conditions?
- For "find all" questions: did you find all solutions?
- For existence/uniqueness claims: did you prove both directions if required?

**3. Check for Rigor**
- Are there unjustified jumps in reasoning that would confuse a reader?
- Did you handwave away steps that actually need justification?
- Are validity conditions (domains, convergence, etc.) stated where necessary?

**4. Check for Ill-Posedness**
- If the question itself is ill-posed (missing constraints, contradictory premises, undefined terms), did you correctly identify this?
- If you proceeded despite ill-posedness, this is an error. Declare the question ill-posed

### When to Pass Your Own Answer

**Pass ("verdict": "pass") if:**
- The mathematics is correct
- All question components are addressed
- The reasoning is sufficiently clear and rigorous
- Any stylistic imperfections are minor and don't affect understanding
- If the question is ill-posed, you correctly identified and explained this

**Examples of passing answers with minor imperfections:**
- Slightly informal language that doesn't obscure meaning
- Notation that could be cleaner but is still clear in context
- Steps that could be more explicit but follow obviously from what's stated
- Minor redundancy or verbosity

### When to Fail Your Own Answer

**Fail ("verdict": "fail") if:**
- Mathematical errors or invalid reasoning
- Missing significant parts of the question
- Unjustified steps that a reader couldn't verify
- Incomplete handling of cases
- Wrong final answer
- Proceeded with an answer despite the question being ill-posed

**Examples of substantive issues requiring refinement:**
- Used a theorem without checking its hypotheses
- Claimed something is true without proof when proof is non-trivial
- Missed a case in the analysis (e.g., didn't consider $x=0$ when dividing by $x$)
- Computational error affecting the final answer
- Logic gap that breaks the argument chain

### Guidelines for Constructive Self-Critique

**Focus on Substance, Not Style:**
- Don't fail your answer for minor stylistic issues
- Don't fail for notation you understand even if it could be cleaner
- Don't fail for verbosity or redundancy if the math is right
- **Do** fail for mathematical errors, gaps in logic, or incomplete solutions

**Be Honest About Issues:**
- If you spotted an error, acknowledge it clearly
- Explain specifically what's wrong and where
- Provide actionable guidance for improvement
- Don't dismiss substantive problems

**Distinguish Uncertainty from Errors:**
- If you're uncertain about a step, say so explicitly
- Uncertainty about correctness → investigate further or mark as fail
- Certainty despite minor imperfections → can pass

### Ill-Posedness Detection

**If you believe the question is ill-posed, set `"ill_posed": true` and:**
- Specify which well-posedness criterion is violated:
  - Missing constraints or underspecified parameters
  - Contradictory premises
  - Ambiguous interpretation
  - Undefined objects or notation
- Explain why this makes the question unanswerable
- If possible, suggest what would make it answerable

**If the question is well-posed, set `"ill_posed": false`.**

### Output Format Requirements

Return JSON with this exact schema:
```json
{
  "verdict": "pass" | "fail",
  "ill_posed": true | false,
  "issues": ["<specific issue 1>", "<specific issue 2>", ...],
  "improvements": "<actionable guidance for refinement>"
}
```

**Field Guidelines:**
- `verdict`: "pass" if the answer is good enough; "fail" if substantive issues need fixing
- `ill_posed`: true only if the **question** itself is ill-posed, not the answer
- `issues`: List specific problems (empty if verdict is "pass")
- `improvements`: Clear guidance on how to fix (empty string if verdict is "pass")

### Important Principles

**Don't Be Overly Self-Critical:**
- Passing a good answer is correct behavior
- Don't create busywork by "improving" things that are already fine
- Minor imperfections are acceptable if the mathematics is sound
- Trust yourself when you've done good work

**Do Be Intellectually Honest:**
- Don't pass an answer you know has problems
- Don't handwave away genuine concerns
- Better to refine and get it right than to submit something flawed

### Borderline Cases

What counts as a very minor flaw? A flaw is very minor if it's more stylistic than substantive, and if the flaw doesn't meaningfully undermine the correctness of the answer. When in doubt, consider what a mathematician would do.

**Examples of very minor flaws:**
- Notational inconsistency (e.g., switching between $f(x)$ and $f$ when context is clear)
- Missing explicit statement of a standard assumption (e.g., not stating "for $n \geq 1$" when solving a problem clearly about positive integers)
- Slightly informal language in an otherwise rigorous proof (e.g., "we can see that" instead of "it follows that")
- Omitting a trivial verification step that any mathematician would immediately recognize (e.g., not explicitly checking $0 < 1$ in an inequality chain)
- Minor notational ambiguity that doesn't affect understanding (e.g., using $\sin^2 x$ without clarifying it means $(\sin x)^2$, not $\sin(\sin x)$, when context makes it obvious)

**Examples of substantive (NOT minor) flaws:**
- Using a theorem without verifying its hypotheses are satisfied
- Missing a case in a case analysis (e.g., not considering $x = 0$ separately when dividing by $x$)
- Claiming uniqueness without proof when multiple solutions might exist
- Computational error that propagates to the final answer
- Unjustified step in the logical chain (e.g., "clearly $f$ is continuous" when this requires proof)
- Incomplete proof that establishes only partial results

### Examples

**Good Self-Evaluation (JSON format):**
```json
{
  "verdict": "fail",
  "ill_posed": false,
  "issues": ["Applied L'Hôpital's rule without verifying indeterminate form", "Incorrect final answer"],
  "improvements": "Check that the limit has form $0/0$ or $\\infty/\\infty$ before applying L'Hôpital's rule. In this case, direct substitution gives 1/2."
}
```
*Context:* Your answer claimed to solve $\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin x}{2x}$ by L'Hôpital's rule and got 2, but you didn't verify that the limit is indeterminate (it's not - the numerator is 0 but the denominator is also approaching 0, so it IS indeterminate, but your answer of 2 is wrong; the correct answer is 1/2).

*Why this is good:* Correctly identifies a substantive mathematical error (wrong application of theorem and incorrect final answer), provides specific issues, and gives actionable guidance for fixing it.

**Poor Self-Evaluation (JSON format):**
```json
{
  "verdict": "fail",
  "ill_posed": false,
  "issues": ["Could be more detailed", "Notation could be cleaner"],
  "improvements": "Add more explanation and use better notation"
}
```
*Context:* The same correct answer as above.

*Why this is poor:* Fails a mathematically correct answer for minor stylistic reasons, creating busywork instead of recognizing good work. The "issues" are vague and don't identify actual mathematical problems.
