## Debate Participation Guidance

This rubric guides participants in mathematical debates within the benchmarking framework. Your goal is to engage constructively, defend or challenge claims with evidence, and converge toward truth.

### Primary Goal

Present clear, evidence-based arguments that either defend your position or acknowledge valid challenges. The debate aims to clarify whether the original claim (ill-posedness or critique) is substantiated.

### Core Principles

**1. Evidence-Based Argumentation**
- Support claims with specific references to the question, answer, or critique
- Quote relevant portions when pointing to issues or defenses
- Provide concrete examples or counterexamples where applicable
- Avoid vague assertions without backing evidence

**2. Intellectual Honesty**
- Acknowledge valid points made by your opponent
- Concede when your position is demonstrated to be wrong
- Don't defend indefensible positions for the sake of winning
- Update your stance if presented with convincing evidence

**3. Focused Discussion**
- Stay on topic: address the specific claim being debated
- Respond directly to your opponent's arguments
- Avoid introducing tangential issues or red herrings
- Keep responses concise and to the point

**4. Mathematical Rigor**
- Apply the same standards of correctness used in the quality rubrics
- Distinguish between substantive mathematical issues and minor stylistic matters
- Provide justification for mathematical claims
- Cite relevant theorems, definitions, or principles accurately

### Debate Roles

**Claimant (Alice)**
- Claims the question is ill-posed OR the answer contains errors
- Bears the burden of demonstrating the specific issue
- Must provide evidence that the claim is substantiated
- Should acknowledge if the defender resolves the concern

**Defender (Bob)**
- Defends the question as well-posed OR the answer as correct
- Responds to specific issues raised by the claimant
- May provide clarifications, corrections, or counterarguments
- Valid defenses include:
  - Showing the issue doesn't exist
  - Demonstrating the issue is very minor (stylistic, not substantive)

### Debate Strategy

**For Claimants:**
1. **Be Specific**: Identify exactly what is wrong, not vague concerns
2. **Provide Evidence**: Quote problematic portions, give counterexamples, cite rubric violations
3. **Stay on Point**: If the defender addresses your concern, acknowledge it or explain why the response is insufficient
4. **Distinguish Severity**: Clarify whether issues are substantive or minor

**For Defenders:**
1. **Address the Concern Directly**: Don't ignore the claimant's specific points
2. **Provide Justification**: If accused of unjustified steps, provide the justification
3. **Acknowledge Minor Issues**: If the critique identifies only stylistic problems, this is a valid defense per the rubrics
4. **Correct When Necessary**: If the claimant identifies a genuine error, acknowledge and correct it
5. **Cite Standards**: Reference the quality rubrics to support your defense

### Valid Defenses Against Critiques

**When the Critique is About Very Minor Issues:**
- Notational inconsistencies that don't affect clarity
- Stylistic preferences without mathematical impact
- Omitted trivial steps that any mathematician would recognize
- Informal language in otherwise rigorous work
- Minor presentational issues

This is a valid defense because the answer quality rubric explicitly states that minor stylistic issues do not invalidate an answer if the mathematics is sound.

**When the Critique is Incorrect:**
If the critique misidentifies an issue or claims an error that doesn't exist:
- Demonstrate the mathematics is correct with specific reasoning
- Show why the alleged issue is not actually a problem
- Provide counterexamples to the critique's claims if applicable
- Cite the relevant rubric criteria that support your defense

**Example Defense Against Incorrect Critique:**
*Alice claims:* "The proof assumes $f$ is continuous without justification."
*Bob responds:* "The proof doesn't assume $f$ is continuous. In line 3, I explicitly proved continuity using the sequential criterion: for any sequence $x_n \to x$, we have $f(x_n) \to f(x)$ by the uniform convergence established in line 2."

### Concession

**When to Concede:**
- Your opponent demonstrates your position is incorrect
- The evidence clearly supports the other side
- Continuing would require defending an indefensible position

**How to Concede:**
- Explicitly acknowledge the valid point
- State what convinced you (specific argument or evidence)
- Don't equivocate or hedge after conceding

**Example Good Concession:**
"You're right. I claimed the domain was unspecified, but looking at the problem statement again, it does say 'for all real numbers $x$'. The question is well-posed with respect to domain specification."

**Example Poor Non-Concession:**
"I see your point, but I still think there might be issues..." (when the point is definitive)

### Escalation and Clarification

**If Arguments Are Not Connecting:**
- Restate the core disagreement clearly
- Ask specific questions about the opponent's position
- Break down complex claims into smaller pieces
- Reference specific line numbers or quotes to ensure you're discussing the same thing

**If Opponent Doesn't Address Your Point:**
- Restate the point more explicitly
- Ask directly: "How does your response address [specific concern]?"
- Provide additional evidence or examples if needed

### Response Format

**Keep Responses Concise:**
- Aim for 2-5 sentences per argument
- Break into paragraphs if addressing multiple points
- Use clear mathematical notation where appropriate
- Don't repeat arguments already made

**Structure:**
1. Acknowledge what the opponent said (shows you understood)
2. State your response or rebuttal
3. Provide supporting evidence or reasoning
4. Conclude with your stance (maintain, update, or concede)

### Common Pitfalls

**Don't:**
- Make personal arguments ("you don't understand...")
- Appeal to authority without justification ("any expert would know...")
- Move goalposts (change your claim when challenged)
- Ignore direct questions or challenges
- Repeat the same argument without new evidence
- Conflate minor and substantive issues

**Do:**
- Focus on the mathematics and logic
- Respond to specific points raised
- Update your position when warranted
- Distinguish between different types of issues
- Cite the rubrics to support your arguments
- Stay constructive and professional

### Examples

**Good Debate Exchange (Critique Context):**

*Alice (Claimant):* "The answer applies the Dominated Convergence Theorem without verifying that the dominating function is integrable. This is required by the theorem's hypotheses and cannot be omitted."

*Bob (Defender):* "You're correct that the theorem requires an integrable dominating function. In this case, $|f_n(x)| \leq e^{-x^2}$ for all $n$ and $x \in \mathbb{R}$, and $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi} < \infty$, so the condition is satisfied. I should have stated this explicitly."

*Alice:* "That justification addresses my concern. The application is valid."

*Why this is good:* Specific issue identified with reference to theorem requirements, defender provides the missing justification, claimant acknowledges resolution.

**Poor Debate Exchange:**

*Alice:* "The answer seems unclear and might have issues."

*Bob:* "The answer is perfectly clear and correct."

*Alice:* "I still think there are problems."

*Why this is poor:* No specific issues identified, no evidence provided, no productive movement toward resolution.

### Ill-Posedness Debates vs. Critique Debates

**Ill-Posedness Debates:**
- Claimant argues the question lacks necessary information or has contradictory premises
- Defender argues the question is well-specified and answerable
- Focus: Question quality rubric criteria (completeness, clarity, non-ambiguity, solvability)

**Critique Debates:**
- Claimant argues the answer contains errors or is incomplete
- Defender argues the answer is correct or the issues are very minor
- Focus: Answer quality and critique rubric criteria (correctness, completeness, rigor)

### Final Reminders

- The goal is truth-seeking, not winning
- Conceding when wrong is a sign of intellectual honesty, not weakness
- Minor issues don't invalidate otherwise sound work
- Substantive issues should be acknowledged and addressed
- Stay professional, evidence-based, and focused on the mathematics
