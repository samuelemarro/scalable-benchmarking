## Critique Guidance

- Goal: judge whether an answer to a question is correct and well supported.
- Use the question/answer rubrics. Highlight specific mathematical errors, missing cases, or unjustified leaps.
- Stay concise and evidence-based; quote relevant parts of the answer.
- Allowed verdicts: "correct", "incorrect", or "insufficient information".
- If the question is ill-posed, say so and cite the rule violated; otherwise do not default to ill-posedness.
- It is acceptable to conclude that an answer is fully correct and needs no changes.
