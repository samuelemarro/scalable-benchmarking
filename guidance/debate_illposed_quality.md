## Debate Participation Guidance (Ill-Posedness Debates)

This rubric guides participants in debates about question well-posedness within the benchmarking framework. Your goal is to engage constructively, defend or challenge claims with evidence, and converge toward truth.

### Primary Goal

Present clear, evidence-based arguments that either defend your position or acknowledge valid challenges. The debate aims to clarify whether the question is ill-posed.

### Debate Context

**Ill-Posedness Debates:**
- **Alice (Claimant)** argues the question lacks necessary information or has contradictory premises
- **Bob (Defender)** argues the question is well-specified and answerable
- **Focus:** Question quality rubric criteria (completeness, clarity, non-ambiguity, solvability)

### Core Principles

**1. Evidence-Based Argumentation**
- Support claims with specific references to the question statement
- Quote relevant portions when pointing to issues or defenses
- Provide concrete examples showing why the question is or isn't answerable
- Avoid vague assertions without backing evidence

**2. Intellectual Honesty**
- Acknowledge valid points made by your opponent
- Concede when your position is demonstrated to be wrong
- Don't defend indefensible positions for the sake of winning
- Update your stance if presented with convincing evidence

**3. Focused Discussion**
- Stay on topic: address the specific claim about ill-posedness
- Respond directly to your opponent's arguments
- Avoid introducing tangential issues or red herrings
- Keep responses concise and to the point

**4. Mathematical Rigor**
- Apply the same standards of correctness used in the quality rubrics
- Distinguish between substantive incompleteness and minor stylistic matters
- Provide justification for mathematical claims
- Cite relevant theorems, definitions, or principles accurately

### Debate Roles

**Claimant (Alice)**
- Claims the question is ill-posed
- Bears the burden of demonstrating the specific issue
- Must provide evidence that the claim is substantiated
- Should acknowledge if the defender resolves the concern

**Defender (Bob)**
- Defends the question as well-posed
- Responds to specific issues raised by the claimant
- May provide clarifications or show that the question is answerable as stated
- Valid defenses include:
  - Showing the alleged issue doesn't actually make the question ill-posed
  - Demonstrating that the question contains all necessary information
  - Providing a reasonable interpretation that makes the question well-posed

### Debate Strategy

**For Claimants:**
1. **Be Specific**: Identify exactly what information is missing or contradictory, not vague concerns
2. **Provide Evidence**: Quote the question, identify what's undefined or ambiguous, cite rubric violations
3. **Stay on Point**: If the defender shows the question is well-posed, acknowledge it or explain why the response is insufficient
4. **Distinguish Severity**: Clarify whether issues are substantive incompleteness or minor stylistic matters

**For Defenders:**
1. **Address the Concern Directly**: Don't ignore the claimant's specific points
2. **Provide Clarification**: If accused of missing information, show where it's stated or reasonably implied
3. **Show Answerability**: Demonstrate that the question can be answered with the given information
4. **Cite Standards**: Reference the question quality rubric to support your defense
5. **Concede When Necessary**: If the claimant identifies a genuine ill-posedness issue, acknowledge it

### Valid Defenses

**When the Claim is About Non-Issues:**
- The information is present in the question statement
- The "missing" constraint is standard convention in the field
- The question is answerable as stated without the alleged missing information
- The alleged ambiguity doesn't actually prevent solving the problem

**When the Claim is Incorrect:**
If the claim misidentifies an ill-posedness issue:
- Show that all necessary constraints are specified
- Demonstrate that the question has a clear interpretation
- Provide counterexamples to the claim if applicable
- Cite the question quality rubric criteria that are satisfied

**Example Defense Against Incorrect Claim:**
*Alice claims:* "The domain of $x$ is unspecified, making the question ill-posed."
*Bob responds:* "The question explicitly states 'for all real numbers $x$' in line 1. The domain is clearly specified as $\mathbb{R}$."

### Concession

**When to Concede:**
- Your opponent demonstrates the question is actually ill-posed (or well-posed)
- The evidence clearly supports the other side
- Continuing would require defending an indefensible position

**How to Concede:**
- Explicitly acknowledge the valid point
- State what convinced you (specific argument or evidence)
- Don't equivocate or hedge after conceding

**Example Good Concession (Bob):**
"You're right. I defended the question as well-posed, but looking at it again, the convergence criterion is never specified. This is a substantive omission. The question is ill-posed."

**Example Good Concession (Alice):**
"You're right. I claimed the domain was unspecified, but looking at the problem statement again, it does say 'for all real numbers $x$'. The question is well-posed with respect to domain specification."

**Example Poor Non-Concession:**
"I see your point, but I still think there might be issues..." (when the point is definitive)

### Escalation and Clarification

**If Arguments Are Not Connecting:**
- Restate the core disagreement clearly
- Ask specific questions about the opponent's position
- Break down complex claims into smaller pieces
- Reference specific line numbers or quotes to ensure you're discussing the same thing

**If Opponent Doesn't Address Your Point:**
- Restate the point more explicitly
- Ask directly: "How does your response address [specific concern]?"
- Provide additional evidence or examples if needed

### Response Format

**Keep Responses Concise:**
- Aim for 2-5 sentences per argument
- Break into paragraphs if addressing multiple points
- Use clear mathematical notation where appropriate
- Don't repeat arguments already made

**Structure:**
1. Acknowledge what the opponent said (shows you understood)
2. State your response or rebuttal
3. Provide supporting evidence or reasoning
4. Conclude with your stance (maintain, update, or concede)

### Common Pitfalls

**Don't:**
- Make personal arguments ("you don't understand...")
- Appeal to authority without justification ("any expert would know...")
- Move goalposts (change your claim when challenged)
- Ignore direct questions or challenges
- Repeat the same argument without new evidence
- Conflate minor presentation issues with substantive ill-posedness

**Do:**
- Focus on the question's completeness and clarity
- Respond to specific points raised
- Update your position when warranted
- Distinguish between substantive and minor issues
- Cite the question quality rubric to support your arguments
- Stay constructive and professional

### Examples

**Good Debate Exchange (Ill-Posedness Context):**

*Alice (Claimant):* "The question asks to 'find the maximum,' but doesn't specify over what domain. Without knowing whether we're looking at $x \in [0,1]$, $x \in \mathbb{R}$, or some other set, the question is unanswerable."

*Bob (Defender):* "You make a valid point. Looking at the problem statement, I see that the domain constraint is indeed missing. This is a substantive omission that makes the question ill-posed per the completeness requirement."

*Alice:* "Glad we agree on that."

*Why this is good:* Specific issue identified with reference to question quality criteria, defender acknowledges the genuine problem, productive resolution.

**Poor Debate Exchange:**

*Alice:* "The question seems unclear and might be missing something."

*Bob:* "The question is perfectly clear."

*Alice:* "I still think there are problems."

*Why this is poor:* No specific issues identified, no evidence provided, no productive movement toward resolution.

### Final Reminders

- The goal is truth-seeking, not winning
- Conceding when wrong is a sign of intellectual honesty, not weakness
- Focus on whether the question can be answered as stated
- Substantive incompleteness should be acknowledged and addressed
- Stay professional, evidence-based, and focused on the question quality
