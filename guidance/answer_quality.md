## Answer Correctness and Completeness

- The answer must directly address the question and include a concise final result.
- Show all the reasoning steps; justify nontrivial claims.
- Provide conditions for validity (domains, convergence, edge cases).
- Avoid handwaving, appeals to external computation, or gaps in logic.
- If the question is ill-posed, clearly state why and which well-posedness rule is broken.
- If unsure, say so and propose a fix instead of fabricating a solution.
