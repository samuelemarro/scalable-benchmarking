## Question Quality and Well-Posedness

Use this rubric for both LLM and human judges.

- The question must be solvable with provided information; include domains, bounds, and assumptions.
- Avoid ambiguity: terms must be defined or standard; the goal and expected answer format are explicit.
- Exclude open problems, brute-force numeric search, or questions requiring external data/tools.
- Ill-posed flags include: missing constraints, contradictory premises, multiple incompatible interpretations, or reliance on undefined objects.
- When rejecting a question as ill-posed, explain the specific defect and which condition above it violates.

When revising a bad question, produce a materially different, well-posed replacement.
