      "comment": "Alice claimed that the correct approach requires showing AB\u2225CD and AB = CD, she is only partly correct.\nAlice is correct to say to show AB\u2225CD , but saying to show AB = CD is mathematically incorrect. Because, while AB must be parallel to CD for ABCD to be an isosceles trapezoid, the bases AB and CD should be unequal. If bases AB and CD are equal, then it's a rectangle, not a trapezoid."
