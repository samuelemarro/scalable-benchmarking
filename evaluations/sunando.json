      "comment": "The solution is incomplete because it doesn't establish that f(x) = \\frac{x(x+1)}{2} for all real x, but only for integers. Without additional assumptions (like continuity), the problem as stated may have other pathological solutions beyond the identified one. The step 4 does prove that this is the only solution (uniqueness)."
